 "content": "Pleth Juun was a Human woman, who became a surgeon and joined the military.\nJuun was born into a wealthy family on the planet Coruscant and attended one of the world's most prestigious medical schools. She later joined the military, as a surgeon, and was given the rank of Lieutenant. While she was in her mid-twenties, she was present on the planet Pleida, where a conflict was being fought, and was attached to a battalion that was commanded by Captain Roff Volane. After a number of officers were injured at the base Camp Kavel, a team of agents were assigned by Volane to escort Juun there, so that she could administer treatment to the officers.\nPleth Juun was a Human female with gray eyes and cropped dark blond hair. Due to her privileged upbringing, she had a haughty demeanor and was arrogant and vindictive. She expected her orders to obeyed and if they weren't, she perceived it as an insult. However, she was a skilled surgeon and a loyal soldier.",
