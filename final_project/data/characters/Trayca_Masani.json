 "content": "Trayca Masani was a female Human who served as an officer in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war she worked as a weapons modifications merchant on the planet Corellia where she ran a stall within the Republic controlled Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport. Masani had black hair, brown eyes and dark skin. While at her stall she wore a white and blue uniform.\nOfficer Masani appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Mods Vendor for Republic players on Corellia. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Masani was removed from the game along with the rest of the Mods Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, which provided her first name.",
