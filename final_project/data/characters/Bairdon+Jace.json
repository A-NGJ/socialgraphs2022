 "content": "Bairdon Jace was a human male and was the Padawan of Khaat Qiyn. In 22 BBY, Jace fought in the First Battle of Geonosis, the opening battle of the Clone Wars.\nBairdon Jace was a human male who was the Padawan of Jedi Master Khaat Qiyn.\nPrior to the Invasion of Naboo, Jace was touring Coruscant with Qiyn when they both sensed the cold presence of Darth Maul, who was secretly tracking them from afar. Jace was unsure if what they sensed through the Force was true, and he asked his master if their senses could have been betraying them. As the two Jedi walked away together, Qiyn warned her Padawan that the shadows they had sensed held great rage that could swallow him whole in the mind, and that he should always trust in the Force.\nIn 22 BBY, he accompanied his master to Geonosis as part of the Jedi assault team to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm√© Amidala. He stormed the arena along with his master, and many comrades.\nBairdon Jace had gray hair, brown eyes, and light skin. After sensing Darth Maul, he thought he couldn't trust the Force.\nBairdon Jace was skilled in lightsaber combat.\nBairdon Jace wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber and wore Jedi robes.\nBairdon Jace first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and was played by Jason Baird, a creature makeup supervisor on the film. Baird's name with the syllables rearranged forms the name of the Padawan he portrayed.\nJace was identified in the 2018 canon reference book Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition.",
