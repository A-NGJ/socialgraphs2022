 "content": "Elaiza was female Human Jedi from Nar Shaddaa who survived the Great Jedi Purge.\nElaiza was a Jedi during the final days of the Galactic Republic. Near the end of the Clone Wars, she had been overwhelmed with the horrors of war and left on a meditative retreat. It was for this reason she escaped the execution of Order 66 and the rise of the Empire. After learning of the fall of the Jedi Order, Elaiza went into hiding on her homeworld of Nar Shaddaa, also called the Smugglers' Moon. There she hid from the Empire and its Jedi hunters among the teeming masses of life crowding the moon.\nAt some time during the Galactic Civil War, Elaiza's aging lightsaber began to fail and a new lightsaber crystal was required to repair it. She traveled to Cloud City to participate in an auction for the Jewel of Yavin, a valuable corusca gem she planned to cut down to create a new crystal for her Jedi weapon.",
