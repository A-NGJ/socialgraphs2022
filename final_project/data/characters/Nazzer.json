 "content": "Nazzer was a bounty hunter for the Crimson Nova during the Clone Wars.\nDuring a battle on Null in 22 BBY, Nazzer, along with several other bounty hunters, attacked the T'ra Saa and Barriss Offee while they were trying to heal wounded friars. Nazzer and his party managed to kill several Jedi and conquer T'ra Saa's lightsaber. When Nazzer took the lightsaber, he left the scene again and went to the space station Rig in Steness knot to pick up his premium from the bounty hunter Mika. As proof that his headhunt for the Jedi was successful, Nazzer introduced the lightsaber of T'ra Saa.\nWith the Jedi unable to tolerate the bounty hunters' guild raising a catch prize, Mace Windu, Saesee Tiin, Agen Kolar, and Kit Fisto went to the Crimson Nova space station to capture the bounty hunter's client and have him delivered to Coruscant. When Mika heard about this Jedi attack plan, she put the rig on alert and doubled the bounty on the Jedi. When Nazza met in the hangar of the station Mace Windu, he tried to kill the Jedi Master to secure the premium, but was killed by Windu's lightsaber.",
