 "content": "Retter Lewis was a Rebel agent and artifacts dealer during the time of the New Order. He was the director of the Rebel Alliance's agent protection network, a fact he kept well-hidden. His base of operations was Callia's, a dealership he ran aboard the luxury liner Cal Ambre. He was recognized as an expert on ancient and unusual religious artifacts, and he believed that he was somewhat attuned to the Force. This allowed him to recognize the more valuable relics, which often were sold to high-ranking Imperial officers and dignitaries. He also dealt in other \"hot commodities\"â€”Imperial personnel who wanted to defect to the Alliance. He arranged for their conversion to the Alliance, alerting his network with coded phrases whenever a \"hot commodity\" became available. He was also the owner of the protocol droid A-3PO.",
