 "content": "Leox Gyasi was a human male pilot who worked for the Byne Guild during the High Republic Era. He flew the starship Vessel, assisted by his co-pilot Affie Hollow and navigator Geode. The crew of the Vessel were tasked with transporting four Jedi to the Starlight Beacon, but the ship was forced to exit hyperspace due to debris from the Great Hyperspace Disaster.\nGyasi was very fond of Hollow, who he affectionately called \"Little Bit.\" He was compassionate and was able to tell when others needed someone to talk to or just wanted to be left alone. Despite these characteristics, Gyasi could also be deceptive, smuggling medicinal spice that he insisted was not illegal as well as allowing the Jedi to pay him for their return trip to the Amaxine space station despite the fact that Gyasi and Hollow were already planning to travel there independent of the Jedi's wishes.\nAs someone who had no interest in sexual activities and did not experience desire for other beings, Gyasi identified as asexual.\nLeox Gyasi was created by Claudia Gray for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative, appearing in her novel The High Republic: Into the Dark, published on February 2, 2021. The character was revealed in an excerpt from the novel published in The High Republic Free Digital Sampler on December 12, 2020. Concept art depicting Gyasi was later shown at a live launch event for The High Republic on January 4, 2021.\nWhen writing Into the Dark, Gray wished to create a pilot character who had the energy of a scoundrel but was unlike Han Solo. She derived Gyasi from the idea of giving a spacecraft to 1990s Matthew McConaughey.",
