 "content": "Warm Face was a female rib-cat who was found by Skrrll on Nar Shaddaa outside Bammy Decree's Spacebarn on Nar Shaddaa. After attacking Loonoo and stealing the Smuggler's Guide, Skrrll found the small rib-cat rubbing against their boot. Reminded of an old pet, a hushstalker named Brutux, Skrrll decided to keep her and named her Warm Face. Warm Face developed a pack-bond with Skrrll who, after finding her, added a likeness of Warm Face to their tag.",
