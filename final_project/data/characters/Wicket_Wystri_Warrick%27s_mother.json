 "content": "The mother of Wicket Wystri Warrick was an Ewok female. She was a part of Bright Tree tribe in Bright Tree Village on the Forest Moon of Endor and, along with the Ewok Deej, parented four children: Weechee, Widdle Warrick, Wicket Warrick, and Winda.\nOne winter, when food was hard to come by, Wicket used his mother's ground-apple stock to thicken the broth of a stew. During that winter, Weechee also noted to Wicket that he did not think the young Ewok could survive an hour without running back to his mother.\nWicket Wystri Warrick's mother was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in \"The Kroolok,\" a short story written by George Mann and Cavan Scott and published in the 2021 short story collection Life Day Treasury. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Wicket Wystri Warrick's mother was named Shodu and first appeared in the 1984 television film Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure. She was then given the last name \"Warrick\" in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
