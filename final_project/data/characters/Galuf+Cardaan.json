 "content": "Galuf Cardaan was a Human male miner who lived on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Galuf Cardaan was part of a group of mining professionals operating in the Gallo Mountains of Naboo. In 1 ABY, a group of criminals, the Mountain Poachers, took over the bunker that served as base of operations for the miners. Cardaan then contacted Sergeant Snopel, a retired Imperial commando, in order to got rid of the poachers. Snopel therefore dispatched a group of commandos under training to deal with the criminals. The commandos attacked the bunker, killing some poachers in the assault, and successfully reclaimed the building. The miners were very satisfied to be able to move back to their bunker.\nGaluf Cardaan was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Galuf Cardaan was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
