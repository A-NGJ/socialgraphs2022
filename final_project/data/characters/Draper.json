 "content": "Draper was a human who served as a lieutenant in the armed forces of the First Order and was also a member of the Supreme Council, a cabinet of high-ranking First Order officers, during the last days of the First Order-Resistance War. In 35 ABY, they attended a meeting of the council on board the Steadfast in which Supreme Leader Kylo Ren presented the head of the Resistance sympathizer Boolio and declared that there was a spy within the First Order. Draper and the other council members then watched as Ren executed Domaric Quinn when he questioned Ren on the First Order's allegiance with the Sith Eternal cult and its Final Order fleet on Exegol.\nLieutenant Draper was played by Alison Rose in Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. Her role is confirmed in the film's credits.",
