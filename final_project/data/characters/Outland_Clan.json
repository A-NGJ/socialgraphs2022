 "content": "The Outland Clan were a clan of S'kytri consisting of those who embraced life as \"walkers\", as well as those who were born reverse-pigmented but had gone undestroyed upon hatching. They made up a third of the S'kytri population on their homeworld of Skye. Long before the Clone Wars, the Outland Clanners served as the Lowlanders' serfs, etching a niche farming the arable land among Skye's mountains. Later, the other clans ended up allowing the Oulanders to live in defiance of the sacred laws in exchange for the foodstuff they produced. Eventually, the genetic terrorist Zeta Magnus turned the Outland Clanners against the other S'kytri, and he turned them into zombie-like creatures.",
