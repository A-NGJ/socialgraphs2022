 "content": "Naley Frifa was an outlaw tech and tattoo artist who was a patron of the Lodge in Fort Ypso on Vandor. Her many talents meant she was rarely without work. As a tattoo artist, she displayed skill at inking both gang symbols and electro-tattoos, the latter of which were capable of carrying data.\nFrifa had black hair and numerous tattoos, including a stylized depiction of a hyperspace simu-tunnel gracing her neck and upper torso, and one on her left arm of the word \"Hiro\" in High Galactic. Her skill as both an outlaw tech and tattooist meant she was regarded as multi-talented, and ensured a steady stream of work.\nNaley Frifa first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story portrayed by tattoo artist L'ain Freefall. The character's name and details were revealed in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
