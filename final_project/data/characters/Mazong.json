 "content": "Mazong was the Highborn of the Yiwa clan of the Alwari tribes of Ansion in the Separatist era, before the Clone Wars. He had red-brown eyes, wore shanh skins, and quickly acquired a great respect for the Jedi, who in 22 BBY had come to aid his planet's leadership and nomadic peoples to resist secession and stay within the Galactic Republic.\nMazong challenged his Jedi guests to demonstrate via individual performances at the clan's evening feast held in their honor that they, in fact, possessed souls, an \"inner essence, unlike the representatives of the great but soulless Senate.\" In this the Jedi were successful, earning Mazong's high respect and critical help in their quest to locate the ruling Borokii overclan.",
