 "content": "Nagem Dr'Lar, also known as Megan Dr'Lar, was an independent Selonian salvager who was salvaging technology and information from the debris left by the first Death Star for the Galactic Empire on the planet Yavin 4. She and a group of technicians were working at a salvage site deep in the jungles.\nWhen Jonna, one of her workers went missing, she asked an individual to help her find him. Unfortunately, that individual found his dead body, and reported back to Nagem. Osae Meilea was not happy with Nagem running her own operation, however, and sent an individual to deal with her. When the individual informed her of Osae's intentions, she ordered her bodyguard Yakasoba to attack the individual. After the defeat of her bodyguard, she agreed to follow Osae's intentions.",
