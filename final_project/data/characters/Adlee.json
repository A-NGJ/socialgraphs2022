 "content": "Adlee was an Ottegan female who as a child lived in the settlement of Reestkii on the desert planet Jakku. When the settlement was overrun by Zygerrian slavers sometime after the Battle of Endor, she and the other residents were rounded up and locked in the town hall. While imprisoned, the Nu-Cosian pet-seller Bobbajo kept Adlee and the other children calm by telling them a story about how he and his animal companions escaped from the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. Part way through the story, the Chevin Jol Bengim interrupted to dispute the story. This upset Adlee, who let out a sob, causing Bobbajo to resume his story in order to distract the children. Once the tale was finished, the storyteller left the town hall and revealed all the slavers had been subdued by unknown forces, allowing the residents of Reestkii to claim the Zygerrian's gathered wealth.\nAdlee first appeared in the short story \"All Creatures Great and Small\", which was written by Landry Q. Walker and released as an eBook in 2015.",
