 "content": "Occo Ninebar was a Neelabi podracer. During his early life, he was exiled from his aquatic homeworld of Neelabi. Occo knew that the only way for him to return to Neelabi was if he became a podracing champion. To fulfill this goal, Occo flew the Enser Flay 254 which allowed him to remain enveloped in water during his races.\nThe name Occo Ninebar is an anagram for Brian Coonce, lead game designer and art director for Star Wars: Racer Revenge.\nThe word 'Neelabi,' Ninebar's species, is an altered, backwards version of the word 'baleen,' the rows of tooth-like brushes that fill a whale's mouth and filter out krill and plankton.\nThe Enser Flay 254, Ninebar's podracer, is a Pig Latin reference to the word 'flenser' . 254 refers to Brian Coonce's phone extension at Rainbow Studios  at the time.",
