 "content": "A giant sarlacc was located next to some ruins on Tatooine, and was larger than the more famous sarlacc in the Great Pit of Carkoon. During the Clone Wars, the sarlacc pit and surrounding ruins became the sight of a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance. During the battle, Separatist leader Count Dooku was Force pushed into the sarlacc by Anakin Skywalker, but the Sith Lord was able to use the Force to escape  before he was eaten.",
