 "content": "Andren Biel was a male Human from the planet Coruscant who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Biel was an Imperial citizen and he trained as an actor at various schools throughout the Core Worlds. He later stowed away aboard a smuggling vessel in order to see the galaxy and he was appalled by what he saw of the Empire, so he enlisted in the Rebel Alliance. Biel served the Alliance as a spy and he was dispatched to the Deep Core to monitor Imperial naval movements, using his acting skills to help him survive. However, his cover was blown while he was in Prak City on the planet Prakith, and he went into hiding in the nearby Asonel Caves.",
