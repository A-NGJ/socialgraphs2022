 "content": "This Advanced Recon Force trooper, who served as a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, was tasked with tracking down the kidnapped son of Jabba the Hutt.\nAfter Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta, was kidnapped by the Sith, this Advanced Recon Force trooper commander was sent along with an ARF trooper lieutenant to track down the kidnapped Hutt. After following hired bounty hunters that were contracted by Jabba, they discovered that the Hutt was sent to a B'omarr monastery on the planet of Teth. After contacting Jedi General Mace Windu, the commander told him that the monastery was too heavily fortified for them to do anything alone. Afterward, once Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's fleet entered the Teth system, the ARF Troopers reported to General Skywalker that there were at least two droid battalions protecting the monastery, and that he would not be able to land there.\nThis trooper wore a lightweight recon armor made of plastoid material, equipped with surveillance gear. His armor was camouflaged to fit the environment of the planet Teth.",
