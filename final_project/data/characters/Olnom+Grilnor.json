 "content": "Olnom Grilnor was a Force-sensitive male Ithorian beastmaster who had fallen to the dark side of the Force during the reign of the Galactic Empire. A Force-sensitive native to the town of Teron's Bluff, Grilnor was seduced by the dark side and driven mad during the Galactic Civil War. Driven from his home by the leaders of Teron's Bluff, Grilnor fled into the wilderness where for over a year he began to plot his revenge on the settlement and his former neighbors. Living in a tent in the forest, Grilnor had access to an ancient holorecording which detailed the powers of a beastmaster. Bending the local manka cats to his will, Grilnor sent the savage felines against the town in hopes of driving the people out of their homes. During the attacks, his presence attracted local stormtroopers and others hired to eliminate the threat he posed.",
