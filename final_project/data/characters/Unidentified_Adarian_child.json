 "content": "An Adarian child lived in Makrin City, the capital of the planet Shelkonwa around the year 0 ABY. One day, when housebreakers tried to break into an apartment of a theater's employee, Leia Organa—who hid from the Empire in Shelkonwa—felt obligated to save the child. She planned to do this by confronting the housebreakers with her blaster. However, after the first shots the housebreakers ran away, because the whole neighborhood woke up and they feared that residents could discover them. The next day, his parents thanked Organa by not betraying her to the Empire.",
