 "content": "San Maxus was a male Devaronian podracer that competed in the race in the Mon Gazza Maze against Ahsoka Tano during the Clone Wars. He was also a Separatist spy that was called Agent Sixteen by Dooku himself.\nSan Maxus received a Republic datachip from the Separatist-aligned Messo and attempted to hand it off to Dooku's hand Asajj Ventress in return for his payoff. Upon reaching the Skeleton Straits of the course, San became engaged in a three-way podracer battle between him, Ahsoka Tano, and Kidd Kareen. Ventress appeared on the hull of San's podracer to receive the data file, but was foiled by Ahsoka who began to fight her with her lightsaber and Anakin Skywalker who Force crushed the datafile. San was left in peril when Ahsoka sliced his podracer in half in mid-flight. However he did not die when his remaining section crashed, as Kidd Kareen later said that he \"retired\", telling in fact he wasn't dead.",
