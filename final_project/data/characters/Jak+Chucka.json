 "content": "Jak Chucka was a male Gungan who lived on Naboo. He had a shifty personality and idolized Boss Rugor Nass, but aspired to become Boss himself one day. He was a member of the Azure Cabal and was one of Broma Lak's local contacts. He used this position to quietly build his own intelligence network among the Gungans, which he hoped to use one day to overcome his enemies and make himself Boss.\nJak Chucka was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
