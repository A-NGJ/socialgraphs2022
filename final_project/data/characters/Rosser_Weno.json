 "content": "Rosser Weno was a human male who lived approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor.\nRosser Weno was present when the smuggler Han Solo entered the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn, and the astromech droid BB-8.\nShortly after Solo, Rey, Finn, and BB-8's arrival, Weno and the rest of the castle's patrons rushed outside to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system, which was caused by Starkiller Base, a superweapon that had been built by the First Order.\nRosser had dark skin and black hair. He wore armor made from combat droid plating on his right shoulder and a cybernetic power brace on his left arm.\nRosser Weno first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. While Weno was not identified in the film, his name was revealed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo. Rosser was portrayed by Elroy Powell in the film.",
