 "content": "Syron Aalun was a male Gand ruetsavii—commonly known as observers—sent to monitor Rogue Squadron pilot Ooryl Qrygg during the Bacta War. Along with fellow ruetsavii Ussar Vlee and Vviir Wiamdi, their task was to determine Qrygg's worthiness to become janwuine, the status in Gand society which allowed one to speak of oneself in the first person. In accordance with their duties, Aalun and his companions participated in a few missions with Rogue Squadron and their allies during the Bacta War to better gauge Qrygg's skills, using a type of Gand starfighter that was essentially a heavily-modified TIE/sa bomber.",
