 "content": "A group of spacers traveled to the planet O'reen in the Unknown Regions to deliver a crate of goods to an O'reenian contact there. They had been hired by another O'reenian, who had claimed the cargo merely consisted of luxury goods and sundries. The O'reenian authorities discovered the weapons cache, and the spacers had to negotiate to avoid arrest or execution. Part of the deal they struck involved revealing the name of the O'reenian contact.",
