 "content": "Gravhan was a Chevin who worked for the Nihil marauder organization during the High Republic Era. Gravhan was an extremely strong individual who served in the Tempest under direction of the Weequay Kassav Milliko, where he held the rank of Storm and led his own team. During his time with the Nihil, Gravhan once ripped a security guard in half with his bare hands on a mission to rob a bank. He fought with Milliko's Tempest in several engagements around the year 232 BBY, including an extortion attempt of the planet Eriadu during the world's struggle with an Emergence of hyperspace debris from the Great Hyperspace Disaster. The job was botched, however, painting a target on the backs of Milliko and his crew.\nAt the Battle of Kur, the Tempest was cornered by a joint task force of Galactic Republic and Jedi forces, as well as a flotilla of Eriaduan cruisers. Although the Nihil employed a devastating array of cruel tactics at the battle, they were ultimately routed by the Republic forces. Gravhan was one of the last survivors aboard Milliko's flagship, the New Elite, when it was boarded by Eriaduan soldiers, who killed all aboard.\nAs a member of the Chevin species, Gravhan had tusks, a large head that had wisps of long blond hair, and wrinkled gray skin.",
