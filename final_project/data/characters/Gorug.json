 "content": "Gorug was a Gamorrean who served as a soldier on the modified Nebulon-B frigate, the Free Lance, commanded by Urias Xhaxin.\nOn a number of occasions, he was reprimanded by Xhaxin for accosting prisoners. On one such occasion, he was strangling the captive Missa, a noble of the House Indupar. Gorug wanted her jewels to give to his matron. When warned off, Gorug challenged Xhaxin to combatâ€”an event that had occurred a number of times before. Xhaxin let him run into the bulkhead wall, and once stunned, held a vibroblade to his throat and threatened to throw him out an air lock if he challenged him again.",
