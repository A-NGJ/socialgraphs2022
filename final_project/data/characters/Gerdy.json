 "content": "Gerdy was a Human male Imperial officer stationed on the remote outpost of Spindrift during the Galactic Civil War. By 3 ABY, Gerdy was in a relationship with a woman on the planet Aduba-4, and often broke Imperial regulations by calling her on priority frequencies. Gerdy was present on Spindrift when the outpost was attacked by disguised Rebel forces flying TIE fighters. Although Gerdy attempted to escape he found all paths cut off, and joined the rest of the surviving Imperial garrison in surrendering to the Rebels.\nGerdy appeared in Star Wars 60, written by David Michelinie, illustrated by Walter Simonson and released in 1982.",
