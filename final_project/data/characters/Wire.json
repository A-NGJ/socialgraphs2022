 "content": "Wire was a male Bothan information broker who lived on Talus during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Wire resided in the city of Dearic, on the planet Talus, and frequented the local cantina. In 1 ABY, a smuggler by the name Cal Handro came to the Bothan because he was trying to get information on who was out to kill him. Wire discovered that the pilot was wanted dead by Trussk, a slavemaster of the Blackscale Clan who considered that Handro was interfering in their business by shipping slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. A few days after Wire talked to him, the smuggler was shot down above Naboo's moon of Rori and disappeared. Spacers recruited by both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire quickly started to search for the missing pilot. The spacers eventually encountered Wire in the Dearic Cantina. The Bothan information broker accepted to share information about Cal Handro but first requested them to help him with a job. The spacers therefore traveled to the Corellian system and successfully defended the freighter of a smuggler working for Wire against attacks from Black Sun pirates. In exchange, the Bothan gave the location of Trussk's fortress on Naboo to the spacers.\nWire was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Wire was added to the game with the third chapter of the \"Secrets of the Syren\" quest line, released with the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"Chapter 1\", published on June 8, 2006, due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the Battle of Restuss.",
