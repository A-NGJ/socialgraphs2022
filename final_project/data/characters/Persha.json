 "content": "Persha was a female Fian who served as the Primate of Al'solib'minet'ri City on the planet Galantos. Fian Councilor Jobath Knox tasked Persha with greeting Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo, along with the rest of a group of individuals representing the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, when they visited Galantos in 28 ABY. Persha handed off responsibility of the guests' welfare to Assistant Primate Thrum after the initial welcoming.\nA female Fian from the planet Galantos near the Koornacht Cluster, Persha achieved the rank of Primate of Al'solib'minet'ri City by the year 28 ABY. At that time, the galaxy's most prominent government, the New Republic, had fallen during an invasion by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong, and the New Republic's successor, the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, was still engaged with the invaders. That year, the Fia decided to make a deal with the Yuuzhan Vong to eliminate the threat of the nearby xenophobic Yevetha species, and the Yuuzhan Vong fulfilled their part of the deal. Because of the Fia's pact with the invaders, communications with the Galactic Alliance were taken down, leaving the other government no idea as to what had transpired on Galantos.\nDue to the communication blackout in the area of Galantos and a tip from the information-collecting Ryn Network, a small Galactic Alliance task force, headed primarily by former New Republic Chief of State Leia Organa Solo and her husband, Han Solo, arrived at Galantos to check on the problem. Fian Councilor Jobath Knox panicked when he learned that representatives from the Galactic Alliance were coming to Galantos, and, fearing that their pact with the Yuuzhan Vong might be discovered, Knox had Persha deal with greeting the guests on their government's behalf instead. Along with a crowd of other Fia, Persha received the members of the Galactic Alliance entourage—consisting of Organa Solo, her husband, Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila, pilot Jagged Fel, and the protocol droid C-3PO—when they landed in Al'solib'menit'ri City in the freighter Millennium Falcon and a clawcraft starfighter.\nCovering Knox's absence with an excuse of other engagements, Persha led the Galactic Alliance representatives to their guest suites while giving them all of the necessary information about their visit. After leaving the group, Persha also panicked and had Assistant Primate Thrum deal with the representatives instead. In the end, however, the Galactic Alliance group learned that the Fia had made a deal with the Yuuzhan Vong, though the Fia's allies turned on them soon after the arrival of the Galactic Alliance task force. Twin Suns Squadron and the Lancer-class frigate Pride of Selonia, both of the Galactic Alliance, helped defeat a Yuuzhan Vong battle group that had been sent to enslave the Fia, and the population of Galantos was saved.\nAs a Fia, Persha was long-featured and had webbed feet and lengthy arms. She had a musical voice that was high pitched, and she tended to talk quite a lot. During the welcoming of the representatives of the Galactic Alliance, Persha kept up a steady stream of details about the newcomers' stay as they were brought to their quarters. Like Jobath Knox, Persha rid herself of the representatives as soon as possible to cover up as best she could the details of the Fia's pact with the Yuuzhan Vong.\nPersha first appeared in the 2003 The New Jedi Order installment The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant, by Shane Dix and Sean Williams. She later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008.",
