 "content": "Innamin was a human male who held the rank of Petty Officer, and later Chief, in the Republic Defense Coalition, as well as being an engineer by training. He served as a Petty Officer under Captain Finial Bright aboard the Republic Longbeam cruiser Aurora IX, and often questioned orders, though Bright usually let him get away with doing so. During a combined effort alongside the Jedi Order to save the Hetzal system from hyperspace anomalies, Innamin fired missiles at one such object from the Aurora IX to protect a solar array, but the missiles did not hit the target due to the speed at which the anomaly was traveling. After the event he was promoted to chief.",
