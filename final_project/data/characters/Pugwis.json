 "content": "Pugwis was a male Dug and the son of Hekula, making him grandson of legendary Podracing champion Sebulba. Though the Dug maintained his grandfather's villainous streak, he had none of the racing skills of his ancestor.\nDespite his shortcomings, Pugwis attempted to climb the Podracing ranks for years, becoming more frustrated with each defeat. He was eventually disqualified from the Podracing circuit permanently after attacking his opponents numerous times. It was actually Pugwis' growing brutality on the track, as well as off the track, that inspired Jabba the Hutt to create his demolition events.",
