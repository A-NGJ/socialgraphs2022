 "content": "An Unidentified Human male Sith apprentice of the Falleen Dark Council member Darth Karrid during the Galactic War around 3640 BBY. He and his Master were killed over Duro during battle of Duro that took place that year.\nWhen Jedi Master Gnost-Dural, his master's former Jedi Mentor, boarded the Ascendant Spear while the ship was docked at Reaver Station, the Human male fought Gnost-Dural, with the help of his fellow Sith Apprentice and some help from his master, Darth Karrid. The trio eventually captured Gnost-Dural and began to interrogate him.\nLater on, when Gnost-Dural had escaped from his captors with the help of Theron Shan, the Sith Apprentice, who at the time was helping his master to control the Ascendant Spear, was interrupted by Jedi Master Gnost-Dural. With the help of Sith Lords Quux and Ordez, he fought the Jedi, but in the end, Master Gnost-Dural overpowered and defeated him with a slash to the mid-rim.",
