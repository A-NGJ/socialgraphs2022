 "content": "Jessa Bo'den was a female green-skinned Twi'lek who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She was a high-ranking member of the Justicars' Brigade, a vigilante militia that controlled a portion of Coruscant. She was killed by a Republic-allied individual in order to secure the access codes she had acquired that would have allowed the Justicars to enter secure Republic facilities.\nJessa Bo'den was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Jessa appears in the Justicars' Tower, as the final boss of the bonus mission in Justicar Territory.",
