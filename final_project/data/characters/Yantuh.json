 "content": "Yantuh was a Hutt who owned a palace on the Hutt jewel world of Mataou. By the time of the Iron Blockade, in which the Galactic Empire blockaded the Anoat sector, Yantuh was dead and the Empire had constructed a small garrison in the Hutt's palace grounds. The Chadra-Fan crime lord Shortpaw asked a young smuggler to attack the garrison on Yantuh's grounds in order to create a distraction, while he tried to sneak a ship past the blockade.\nYantuh was first mentioned in the video game Star Wars: Uprising, which was released in 2015 on mobile platforms.",
