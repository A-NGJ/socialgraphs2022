 "content": "Joli Ti Eddawan was a female Human and the daughter of Senator Galim Eddawan who represented Tyan in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. In 76 BBY, Lorian Nod used her voice to let Dooku and his Padawan believe that she was on his ship. Qui-Gon, being very inexperienced yet, thought a young child could die and so he tried to save her from the pirates. However, on the ship he only found a recorder with her voice; she and her father had been killed days before.",
