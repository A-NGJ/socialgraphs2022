 "content": "Abel was a criminal on the planet of Dantooine. He was the muscle in a group of thugs who roamed a major city on the planet. When Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker arrived on the world to buy supplies from an Ortolan merchant, Abel and the rest of the gang encountered the young Jedi. The leader of the gang ordered Abel to take Skywalker to the roof, apparently to mug him. However, when Abel and the rest of the group arrived, Luke used his quick reflexes and his lightsaber to turn on his would-be captors. The fast spin with his weapon caught Abel off-guard, and he was killed.",
