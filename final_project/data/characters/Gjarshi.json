 "content": "Gjarshi was a male Black Rakata. It was his job to chronicle the conquests and achievements of The One. When Revan visited the Rakata for a second time, he chose to side with the Eldersâ€”which angered The One, who then attacked Revan, but was slain. The rest of The One's tribe, including Gjarshi, attacked Revan but were subsequently killed.\nIf the player chooses the dark side path, and sides with the tribe of The One, or lies to One about defeating the Elders, then it will be Gjarshi who tells the player of the history of the Rakata and the tribes.",
