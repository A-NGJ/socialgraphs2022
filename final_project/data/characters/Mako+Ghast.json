 "content": "Mako Ghast was a Chiss male member of the Lok Revenants who lived on Lok during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Mako Ghast was a member of the Lok Revenants and a lieutenant of their leader Nym. He used to work in Nym's palace, in the city known as Nym's Stronghold.\nIn 1 ABY, Ghast was involved in most major operations of the Lok Revenants. That year, the Lok Revenants assaulted the hideout of their enemies, the Sulfur Lake Pirates, to retrieve the valuable memory module of an Imperial droid. Mako Ghast tasked a spacer involved in this mission to kill a dangerous creature known as the Bridge Troll that guarded the pirate hideout. The same year, the Lok Revenants raided an Imperial mine where the release of an unknown toxic gas had made the miners become completely crazy and very hostile. Ghast requested the spacer to eliminate two miners, Raynar Cath and Wes Riggers, who were notorious opponents of Nym. Later, the Revenants attacked an Imperial research facility on Lok to steal experimental weapons developed and produced there. This time, Mako Ghast asked the spacer to kill four of the mercenaries who defended the facility, Kendo Ryzak, Platt Pareja, Goll Bardok, Jeran Tarven, because they had meddled in the affairs of Nym.\nMako Ghast was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mako Ghast was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
