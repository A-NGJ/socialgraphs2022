 "content": "Breshin was a female Cathar who worked as a geologist during the Cold War. She specialized in recovering powerful lightsaber crystals. Breshin had a shop on Carrick Station, where she sold her findings to the Galactic Republic's forces.\nGeologist Breshin and her Imperial counterpart, Geologist Pajro, were added to the Republic and Imperial Fleets in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic with Game Update 1.15 on March 6, 2015. Intended as a temporary measure, the two vendors sold a variety of previously-unavailable endgame crystals, and were removed with Game Update 1.2 on April 12.",
