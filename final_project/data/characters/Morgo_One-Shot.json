 "content": "Morgo One-Shot was a male Zabrak who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nMorgo One-Shot was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Morgo One-Shot spawned under the generic \"jabba_assassin\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a male Zabrak or as a Human female. Because the quest dialogue implied Morgo One-Shot was a male, this article assumes that the male Zabrak depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
