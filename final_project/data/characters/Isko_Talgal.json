 "content": "Isko Talgal was a female Mandalorian warrior who lived prior to and during the Second Galactic Civil War. Talgal was a grim-faced woman with graying black hair. She was present at a meeting between Boba Fett and several other Mandalorians in Zerria's Bar on Drall in 40 ABY. She would later accompany Fett and several other Mandalorians when Fett was hired as backup by Natasi Daala during the Second Battle of Fondor.\nHer surname derives from the Mando'a verb \"tal'galar\", which means \"to spill blood/to bleed\".",
