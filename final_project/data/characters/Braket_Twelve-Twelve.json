 "content": "Braket Twelve-Twelve, or Braket 12-12 was a human male, who served Fyzen Gor's Brotherhood of Wire and Bone on the moon Grava in 7 ABY. He had a pale face, that was ratcheted with scars, an empty eye socket and a corruption of stitches and filth where his nose should've been. Nine-Seven Saquanz and he were the first to encounter Han Solo and Lando Calrissian when they arrived on Grava to find former Imperial Admiral Ruas Fastent. They asked them to hand over their weapons, but as the two scoundrels refused to do so, several members of the cult emerged from the bushes including Balthamus.",
