 "content": "Adon'aris was a male Twi'lek thug who was employed by the club owner Orman on the planet Lianna. He was considered quite handsome but had few other interesting qualities and in battle preferred stealth to open combat knowing his physical limitations. He was ordered at some point during his employment to attack a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents along with the other thugs on Orman's payroll; the Gamorrean Steef, the Quarren Wheade Daud, and the Humans Ekh the Red, Sandi, and Fish.",
