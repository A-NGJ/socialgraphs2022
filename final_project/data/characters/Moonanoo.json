 "content": "Moonanoo, nicknamed Moona, was a Chadra-Fan female who was the wife of Doctor Kisma Uttersond, a collaborator of the Nihil marauder organization. Uttersond and Moonanoo lived with a number of fanlings in a house on Chad. When Uttersond betrayed the Nihil, attempting to sell creatures known as the Nameless on the black market, he returned to his home and assured Moonanoo that his profit would pay off his debts from medical school and help their family. Ultimately, Uttersond's plot was foiled by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order.",
