 "content": "Ekh, nicknamed Ekh the Red, was a male Human thug who lived on Lianna, and was the club owner Orman's second-in-command and the leader of his thugs. He held this position due to the fact that he was immensely loyal to Orman, although he was lacking in talent and experience. At some point during his employment under Orman, Ekh lead an attack on a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents. At this time, he appeared quite young with curly red hair and freckles.",
