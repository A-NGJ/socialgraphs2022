 "content": "Graz, more popularly known as Graz the Hunter, was a male Gank bounty hunter during the reign of the Galactic Empire.\nGraz was considered by many to be an ideal bounty hunter: professional, efficient, and extremely adept at violence. He worked with many law enforcement agencies in the Outer Rim, and developed a reputation for fulfilling bounties exactly to the lettered specifications with a mechanical precision. Unlike other Ganks, Graz was known to meticulously avoid collateral damage or harm civilians. He was also known for his skill with a rifle and pistol, and for flying a heavily customized Kihraxz assault fighter.",
