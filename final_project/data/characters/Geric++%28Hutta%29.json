 "content": "Geric was a Human male who lived on Nal Hutta during the Cold War as a supporter to the resurgent Sith Empire.\nGeric worked in a factory for years and became sick due to the noxious poison in the air he breathed, forcing him to have an artificial lung. He saved part of his earnings to fund his personal project: a system to purify the waters of the River Lands. Despite the positive effects of his work to the environment, the Hutts were displeased, as it interfered with the lucrative procedure of retrieving valuable chemicals from the rivers. They manipulated settlers into turning against Geric, driving him out into the swamps before he could finish cleaning the waters. His illness prevented him from taking action, so he asked an Imperial spacer to release his cleaning solution into the polluted waters at the Old Muckworks.",
