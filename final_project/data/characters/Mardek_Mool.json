 "content": "Mardek Mool was a Bith male who represented the former Jedi Tahiri Veila during her trial after her first lawyer, Nawara Ven, was prohibited by the Galactic Alliance courts to represent her. Mool convinced Veila to stop admitting her guilt of killing Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, reasoning that she was under the influence of Sith Lord Darth Caedus.\nMool advised Veila to take a plea deal Daala was offering, because though he had years experience, she needed someone with decades experience. If the case went to trial he \"wouldn't even know what the rules were.\"",
