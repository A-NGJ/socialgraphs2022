 "content": "K'Sheek was the name of a Human female who was abducted and raised by Sand People on Tatooine. The Tusken who took her was named Yark, and she became a sister to A'Yark. She was also the wife of Sharad Hett, and mother of A'Sharad Hett. Though raised by Sand People, she was not one herself; she had been brought into their tribe when she was nearly an adult, and henceforth treated as one of their own. She previously lived as a slave before the Tusken Raiders took her.\nNot long after her son's birth, K'Sheek disappeared into a sand storm, leaving no trace.",
