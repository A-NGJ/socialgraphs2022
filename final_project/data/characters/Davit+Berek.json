 "content": "Davit Berek was a male Human who lived on the planet Pamorjal during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nBerek became a member of the Pamorjal Freeman's League, a resistance group that opposed the actions of mega-corporations on Pamorjal. In 3 ABY, the Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra traveled to Pamorjal while being pursued by a group of Rebel Alliance agents, an he convinced the PFL that the agents were in fact representatives of TaggeCo. Berek led a PFL assault team in an attack on the agents outside the Temples of Vormijj, but eventually realized that Rystra had tricked the League. Feeling guilty, because the PFL had destroyed the agents' starship, Berek gave them the Celestial Dancer, a YT-2000 light freighter that was owned by the League.",
