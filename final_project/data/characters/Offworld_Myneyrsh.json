 "content": "This driver, a young Myneyrsh male, piloted a landspeeder on the planet Drongar in 20 BBY. He was hired by Admiral Tarnese Bleyd to ferry him to Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7, a mobile temporay hospital for clone troopers injured while combating the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the name of the Galactic Republic. He carried a blaster issued to him, though his passenger believed that if a dangerous situation arose, his driver would use a combat knife that was hung around his neck with a wire.\nIt was very uncommon to see a Myneyrsh off their homeworld of Wayland, more so to see one with a technological weapon like a blaster or piloting a ship of any kind. Myneyrshi had a natural aversion to technology due to many years of being oppressed by such tools.",
