During the war she was stationed in the Republic's secret prison on the planet Belsavis. In the prison she operated a stall in the Prison Command Center of the Minimum Security Section, where she sold equipment from a stall to various Republic personnel. She wore armor with orange coloring and carried a blaster pistol while at his stall. Lorchlar had brown skin, black hair, and green eyes.\nCaptain Korventine appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Equipment Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Belsavis.
