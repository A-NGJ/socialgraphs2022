 "content": "Ganamey Davloterra was the human female art director of the weekly newstack Chrono during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Known throughout the publishing houses of the planet Coruscant as a woman of uncompromising political ideals, she was commissioned to produce the art piece known as \"Taxation Without Federation\" for the weekend edition of the HoloNet News, which made a statement against the taxation of trade routes by the Neimoidian-led Trade Federation. The piece became widely distributed throughout the Mid Rim, but was quickly criticized by Trade Federation spin doctors as racist since it depicted the stereotyped image of a fat Neimoidian plutocrat.\nGanamey Davloterra was first mentioned in Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.",
