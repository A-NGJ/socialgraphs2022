 "content": "A clone served as a shock trooper with Coruscant Guard during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists. He was stationed at the Republic military base in Galactic City on Coruscant.\nThe trooper along with Commander Fox escorted Jedi Ahsoka Tano to Letta Turmond's cell, who was being held for the attack on the Jedi Temple. Leaving Tano with Turmond, the shock troopers returned to the guard post. Meanwhile Turmond revealed that a Jedi had showed her how to make the bomb in an effort to make a statement against the Jedi being involved in the war. Before Turmond could give Tano the name, Turmond was Force-choked, unknown to all, by Jedi Barriss Offee. However, the view from the security cameras made it appears as if Tano was the one choking Turmond. The trooper notified Fox of Turmond's distress. They quickly rushed into the cell, only to find Tano, apparently distraught, bending over Turmond's dead body. Fox, while not blaming Tano for wanting revenge on a traitor, placed her under arrest.",
