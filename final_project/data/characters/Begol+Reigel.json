 "content": "Begol Reigel was a male Bothan who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Reigel asked a spacer to enact revenge against a number of spice dealers for getting his daughter Shan'ri hooked on death sticks, thus resulting in her death.\nBegol Reigel appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
