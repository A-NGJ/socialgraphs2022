After the Battle of Yavin, spacers learned about the legendary fighting skills of Mordran and challenged him to a duel.\nMordran appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
