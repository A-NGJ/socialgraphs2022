 "content": "Belkan was a Human male who served in the Republic Military during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. When his squad was sent down into The Works on Coruscant to combat a group of rogue droids, they encountered an Imperial strike team that was attempting to recover an astrogation computer from the ruins of the Jedi Temple. Belkan was fatally injured in the attack, but managed to communicate his mission to a traveling hero, who successfully retrieved the computer.\nA member of the Republic Military, Belkan had achieved the rank of Ensign by 3643 BBY. He served under General Wendin, who commanded the Republic forces on the Republic's capital world Coruscant. Following the Sacking of Coruscant by the Sith, the programming of many droids in The Works became corrupted and they began to attack anyone they encountered.\nDuring the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire that followed the Sacking, Belkan and his squad was sent into the Works to both aid the Republic forces there and to search for a valuable astrogation computer in the ruins of the Jedi Temple. But Belkan's unit unintentionally stumbled across part of an Imperial strike team, which was searching for the same computer, and were promptly ambushed. The Imperials decimated the squad, forcing them to retreat back to the Republic's base in the upper Works.\nEnsign Belkan was critically injured in the attack, but he managed to encounter a traveling hero to whom he relayed the threat of the Imperials before he died. Thanks to Belkan's information, the hero was able to enter the Temple and recover the computer from the Sith forces within. The hero gave the computer to General Wendin, giving the Republic access to a series of secret hyperspace routes.\nEnsign Belkan was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Belkan can be found in the Works, where he gives Republic characters the Heroic Mission \"Enemies of the Republic\".",
