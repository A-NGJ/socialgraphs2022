 "content": "Wudei Wadai was an Aqualish who served in the intelligence branch of the Alliance to Restore the Republic at the time of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, Wadai arrived in the Anoat sector with two other Alliance operatives. They were trapped there when the Galactic Empire initiated the blockade of the sector.\nWadai joined the crew of the Smuggler, who dispatched the Aqualish on a variety of missions throughout the Anoat sector.\nWadai was created for the canon mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam for iOS and Android platforms and released in 2015. He was released as a log-in prize for May 10, 2016 as a Tier 2, 5 star unique crew member.",
