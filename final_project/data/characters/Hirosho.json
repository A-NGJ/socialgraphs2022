 "content": "Hirosho was a Human male Agent who served in the Republic Strategic Information Service during the Cold War against the resurgent Sith Empire. Hirosho and his team were responsible for tracking Darth Baras' apprentice's personal starship by orders of Jedi Master Nomen Karr, but were eventually exposed.\nDuring the Cold War, Jedi Master Nomen Karr became aware of Darth Baras acquiring a new apprentice. Hirosho was assigned among a number of other technicians and Republic soldiers to maintain an orbital listening post and to track the apprentice's ship throughout the galaxy, though Karr withheld the identity of their target.\nHowever, the listening station's subterfuge did not go unnoticed for long, as Baras discovered its existence and sent his apprentice to put an end to its operation. The Sith Warrior eventually reached the command center, and though Karr pleaded for the lives of Hirosho and his team, the apprentice showed no mercy and killed all of them.\nThe player has the choice of either executing  or sparing  Hirosho and his men.",
