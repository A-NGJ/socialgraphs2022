 "content": "During the Battle of Scarif, an officer wearing a rank insignia plaque with a row of four blue squares worked on the shield gate above Scarif. He informed Imperial cargo shuttle SW-0608 that they were not on the manifest. The pilot responded that they had been re-routed from the recently attacked Eadu Flight Station and transmitted the proper clearance codes, which this officer confirmed. Unknown to him, the cargo shuttle secretly held a commando team of Rebels led by Jyn Erso, who raided the facility planetside and ultimately beamed the Death Star plans to a Rebel fleet. The shield gate was destroyed during the battle between that fleet and the Imperial Navy and garrison.\n\nThe Gate officer was portrayed by Michael Nardone in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
