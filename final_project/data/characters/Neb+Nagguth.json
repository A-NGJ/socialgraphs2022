 "content": "Neb Nagguth was a Sullustan child who lived in Oluna Biqua on Genarius during the Clone Wars.\nNeb was the son of Syun Nagguth, a parade pilot. When the gas Trinex-M was released into the atmosphere of Oluna Biqua, Neb was infected by it, along with the rest of the city's population. It drove him insane and he stole his father's Z-95 Headhunter and began flying it, believing that he was participating in the Battle of Naboo. The Headhunter was loaded with fireworks, for an upcoming festival, and Neb fired them at imaginary droid starfighters.",
