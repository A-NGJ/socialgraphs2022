 "content": "Jorak Uln was a Human male Sith Master who served as the headmaster of the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban for some time. During the Great Sith War, Uln was a Sith acolyte under the Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun. Sometime after Kun's Sith Empire was defeated by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, Uln became the headmaster of Korriban's Sith Academy, eventually taking the humanoid Uthar Wynn as his Sith apprentice. In 3959 BBY, when the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak initiated the Jedi Civil War, Uln swore allegiance to their Sith Empire and trained many of Revan and Malak's Dark Jedi.\nEventually, Uln grew mentally unstable and was driven out of the Academy by Wynn, who usurped his position as the Academy's headmaster. Uln took up residence in the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Tulak Hord, located in the Valley of the Dark Lords. In the Jedi Civil War's final year, Uln encountered Revan—now a retrained Jedi Padawan—during the Jedi's quest to find the Rakatan Star Forge space station, which was under the control of the reigning Dark Lord, Darth Malak. The Sith Master trapped Revan and his companions inside Tulak Hord's tomb, and tested the Jedi's knowledge of the Sith ways while torturing him and the Sith student Mekel. When Uln's test concluded, Revan and his companions joined forces with Mekel and slew the Sith Master.\nJorak Uln, a Human male, served as an acolyte under Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun's Sith Empire during the Great Sith War. Sometime after the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic defeated Kun, Uln became the headmaster of the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban. During this time, the Sith Master took Uthar Wynn as his apprentice.\nIn 3959 BBY, the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak initiated the Jedi Civil War and recaptured Korriban as part of their Sith Empire. Uln swore loyalty to Revan and trained many of the Dark Lord's Dark Jedi at the revitalized Academy. However, Uln began to succumb to mental illness and was overthrown by Wynn, who took over his former master's position as headmaster. Uln went into hiding in the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Tulak Hord, and during his tenure in Hord's tomb, he studied the ancient ruins to find theories on the philosophies of the ancient Sith. By 3956 BBY, the third year of the war, Uln had gained a reputation for being the \"old hermit in hiding.\" He began capturing pupils from the Academy and forced them to participate in torture games, hoping to find individuals who shared traits exhibited by the ancient Sith. Uln would many times drug these captives in an attempt to extract information from them.\nIn the Jedi Civil War's final year, the former Sith Lord Revan, now a retrained Jedi Padawan, explored Tulak Hord's tomb under the guise of a Sith student. Revan was searching for the Rakatan Star Forge, a space station under the control of his former apprentice and the ruling Dark Lord, Darth Malak. When Revan, who had heard of Uln's reputation, and his companions attempted to make their way to Hord's sarcophagus, they were incapacitated by a trap set by Uln. The former headmaster then took Revan to the room where Hord's sarcophagus was.\nAfter Revan awoke, Uln introduced himself to the Jedi and forced him to participate in a test of knowledge of the Sith ways. Uln told Revan that if he answered several questions concerning Sith morality correctly, Uln would torture the Sith student Mekel, who was also in the tomb, with Force lightning. Uln also informed Revan that incorrect answers and refusals to answer would result in the Jedi himself being tortured. When the game began, Revan answered Uln's four questions incorrectly in order to spare Mekel's life. Much to Uln's surprise, Revan survived the test. The Sith Master told Mekel that he was free to leave the tomb while he figured out what to do with Revan, but Mekel instead assaulted Uln with the Force. Angered by this, Uln attacked both Mekel and Revan, but the Jedi and his allies, along with Mekel, combined forces and killed the former headmaster. After Uln's death, Revan was able to convince Mekel to abandon the Sith ways. Revan later presented Wynn with Uln's ancient Sith tablet, which contained recordings of Tulak Hord's teachings.\nDuring his time as the Sith Academy's headmaster, the Human male Jorak Uln began to grow mentally unstable. His skin was a sickly pale and his eyes were white. By the time he met Revan, Uln was bald, and only had hair on the back of his head. Uln possessed strong beliefs in the principles and teachings of the Sith. During his time in Hord's tomb, he studied the ancient ruins inside to find theories on the ancient Sith's philosophies. He believed that the students that his successor, Uthar Wynn, had been training lacked the \"gumption\" and purity he expected from a true Sith. Because of this, he captured students from the Sith Academy and played torture games with them, in the hopes of finding students who exhibited traits of the old Sith. These games involved questioning the students and torturing them if they failed to answer the question correctly. He was sadistic in his teaching and activism for the Sith cause. Although Uln believed that he would still be remembered for being the Academy's former headmaster, he did not expect the Sith to consider him an \"old hermit,\" which he believed to be slander. Uln held Wynn in low regard and went out of his way to ridicule Wynn's teachings.\nUln was capable of setting traps in order to capture students for his torture sessions. In addition, Uln possessed abilities which allowed him to fend off the tuk'ata and shyrack creatures that also resided in Hord's tomb.\nUln owned an ancient Sith tablet that he successfully translated; the tablet also contained his opinions of Tulak Hord's teachings. Uln possessed a double-bladed lightsaber containing a red crystal, and also kept an Opila lightsaber crystal.\nAs a Sith Master, Uln had a strong command of the dark side of the Force. He was capable of using Force lightning, often employing this both against his enemies and on the Academy's students that he captured. Uln also used the Force to choke his foes and drain their life forces, replenishing his own vitality. During combat, Uln wielded a double-bladed lightsaber.\nJorak Uln was created as a villain for the 2003 Xbox and PC video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. Uln was mentioned in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide, and received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.\nAlthough there are multiple choices that the player can make in-game with Uln, the canonical choices are the options that increase Revan's alignment with the light side. If the player follows the dark side, he or she can allow Mekel to die by answering three of Uln's questions correctly. Alternately, Revan can cooperate with Mekel to defeat Uln, then kill the student. Revan can also let Mekel attack and be killed by Uln, a course of action that results in the Sith Master's loss of vitality. This option results in no alignment change. The player can also choose to not explore Hord's tomb, entirely skipping an encounter with Uln.",
