 "content": "RC-5093 was a clone commando who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Ultimately surviving the conflict, RC-5093 went on to retire from the military and began living in the CF VetCenter located on the galactic capital planet, Coruscant. During his retirement, RC-5093 was asked what he thought about the Clone Wars, but, having never been able to form his own opinion or beliefs, the former commando was unable to answer.\nBred on the planet Kamino, RC-5093 was one of the many clones of the Human male bounty hunter Jango Fett. Trained to be a clone commando, RC-5093 was created to serve in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army during the Clone Wars against the Separatists.\nRC-5093 survived the Clone Wars, and he later retired from the military was interviewed at the CF VetCenter on the Core Worlds planet Coruscant. During the interview, RC-5093 was asked how he felt about the war for which he had been bred, but he was unable to formulate a reply, having never before been asked his opinion. The former commando was twenty-three standard years old when he was asked the question, but, due to the advanced aging process of all clone troopers, RC-5093 was sixty biological years old at the time.\nAs a clone commando, RC-5093 was trained for covert infiltration, sabotage, demolition, and assassination. RC-5093 stood 1.83 meters tall, like all other clone troopers. However, also like other clone troopers, RC-5093 had his individuality and independence suppressed during his training and was therefore unable to form his own opinions. Thus, when asked about his opinion on the Clone Wars, RC-5093 was unable to reply.\nRC-5093 first appeared in the 2004 novel Hard Contact, the first novel in the Republic Commando series written by Karen Traviss; he was quoted at the beginning of the novel's sixteenth chapter.",
