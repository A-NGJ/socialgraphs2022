 "content": "Durril was a human male who served as an admiral in the Imperial Navy and was present during the Batonn insurgency. Admiral Durril commanded the Imperial Star Destroyer Judicator of the One Oh Third Task Force during the Battle of Scrim Island.\nAdmiral Durril was tasked with taking out the Batonn insurgents, who had seized Scrim Island. He took up the \"Standard Siege Tactic.\" After negotiating supposedly failed he ordered all ships to fire on the shield generator covering the Island. This had no affect on the strength of the shield generator. Whilst Durril focused his efforts on the center of the shield the western and southern edges contracted and two ion cannons fired into the Judicator. He ordered his escort frigates to fire at the edge but by the time they started the shield had expanded back over them. The shield then contracted in the north and fired some more ion shots whilst the One Oh Third Task Force fired on the western and southern emplacements . As Durril's view changed to the North, eight freighters snuck out from under the shield. Seven went to other continents and one went back into space and later jumped away.\nThe Battle of Scrim Island was a crushing defeat for Durril as he failed to recapture Scrim Island. He was forced into repair and was assigned elsewhere for Admiral Thrawn to complete the mission instead.\nDurril first appeared in the 2017 novel Thrawn by Timothy Zahn.",
