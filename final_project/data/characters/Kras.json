 "content": "Kras was a Human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas where he advised the Sith Military council.\nA Force-sensitive Human male, Kras held the rank of Sith Lord—an influential position—in the resurgent Sith Empire, by the time of the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. Around the year 3643 BBY, Lord Kras was present in Dromund Kaas, meeting with the Minister of War to recommend the Empire's next moves against the Republic. Before the meeting, Lord Kras requested battle reports from Lieutenant Mallohe, a member of the Imperial Navy, who assigned an individual affiliated with the Empire to deliver them. Upon delivery, Kras recognized the individual as a veteran of the recent capture of the Brentaal Star, a mission against a Republic ship which ended with its capture.\nLord Kras was first featured in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG produced by BioWare. He appears in the optional quest \"Imperial High Command\" for the planet Dromund Kaas. In this quest, the player receives reports from a quest giver character—Lieutenant Mallohe—and is assigned to deliver them to Kras.",
