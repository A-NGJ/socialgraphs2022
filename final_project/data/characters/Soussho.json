 "content": "Soussho was a Mirialan male and a member of the Data Seekers, a secretive organization that sought to unravel the mysteries of the Anoat sector's shrouded history during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Caught behind the Iron Blockade enacted by Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard in the wake of the second Death Star's destruction, Soussho took to operating on worlds such as Bespin and Burnin Konn, where he traded secrets like currency, offering work and lesser information to those he deemed likely to advance the Seekers' cause. Soussho was in charge of the Seeker's transfer pilots.\nDuring a period of rebellious unrest in the sector, the Mirialan Data Seeker came into contact with an up-and-coming young smuggler from Burnin Konn. On several occasions, Soussho offered various bits of intelligence and opportunities for work to the talented scoundrel.\nSoussho first appeared in Star Wars canon in the multiplayer mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, created by the Kabam company and released on September 10, 2015 for iOS and Android platforms. Within the scope of the game, Soussho acts as one of several quest givers for the player character.",
