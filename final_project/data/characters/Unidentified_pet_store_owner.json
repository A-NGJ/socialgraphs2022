 "content": "A male Human with gray hair owned a pet store on Coruscant at the height of the New Republic. Contrary to many other shady businesses in the planet-wide city, his was a perfectly legitimate and well-stocked store. The Human was reputed for managing his shop in an effective way. When the notorious zoologist Lyrre T'enna collected information on Coruscant's animal life for a published version of her field guide, she encountered the shopkeeper. T'enna draw a picture of him in the company of the animals he sold, which included voorpaks, faas, nunas, jakrabs, a peko-peko, a shaupaut, and a greysor.\nAn older man with silver hair and pale, wrinkled skin, the Human store owner had blue eyes and a double chin. On the portrait drawn by Lyrre T'enna, he had a gentle, meek smile. He was slightly overweight, and he wore burgundy and blue robes with a front pocket big enough to accommodate a small voorpak. Unlike some of his fellow dealers who were outright immoral, that man had principles and worked effectively in a legal and regular manner.",
