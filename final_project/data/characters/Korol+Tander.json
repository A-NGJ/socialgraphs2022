 "content": "Korol Tander was a male Twi'lek who worked as a Special Agent with the Galactic Republic's Strategic Information Service during the Cold War. Tander was stationed on Nar Shaddaa, under Bureau Chief Rieekan. Out of fear that their agents had been compromised, Tander sent an omega alert to their field agents, but only half responded. Tander argued that the unit should abandon their base, but Rieekan refused to move their base and compromise their current operations. During an attack on the SIS safe house, Rieekan was killed and Tander took over as Acting Bureau Chief. He would later achieve the rank of Field Operations Director.\nTander was a competent and dedicated SIS agent, and he put the safety of his entire unit ahead of a single operation.",
