 "content": "A young Muun was among a group of younglings brought to the crystalline world of Mygeeto by one of the wives of Caar Damask, the Muun administrator of the world, for the sole purpose of being a playmate for their son, Hego Damask. One afternoon, the young Muun pushed past Hego while trying to reach the staircase that went down to the lower-level courtyard of the Damask residence. Hego, who had grown to dislike the youth, grabbed the Muun's upper arm and used the Force, suggesting that if the youngling was in such a hurry, to jump out the window instead. Locking eyes with the youngster and repeating the suggestion, Hego managed to convince the youth to jump to death. Though many questions were raised following the youngling's death, the young Damask revealed the truth of his trick only to his mother.\nThe young Muun appeared in a flashback sequence in the 2012 novel Darth Plagueis, written by James Luceno.",
