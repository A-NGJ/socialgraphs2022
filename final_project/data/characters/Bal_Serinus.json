 "content": "Bal Serinus was a female Dark Jedi guardian that lived during and after the Ruusan campaign. While searching for Sith artifacts in the palace of a Hutt slaver on Nar Shaddaa, she encountered the fallen Jedi Set Harth. The two dueled each other to exhaustion, and were both captured by the Hutt slaver. While they were imprisoned in separate cells, Harth and Serinus communicated through the Force. Harth promised to protect Serinus from harm until she suddenly rebuffed his telepathic contact out of fear. Harth swore revenge against her for the slight.",
