 "content": "Gegorran was a Human weapons merchant who had set up shop on the Merchant Quarter of Onderon's only city, Iziz, prior to the Onderon Civil War.\nMost people referred to him as Geg. Due to increasing fears of Republic insurgents and terrorists working against General Vaklu which resulted in increasing regulations meant to \"keep order,\" but were in reality thinly-disguised attempts to expedite the planned coup by Vaklu against Queen Talia, he could only sell his products to people with starport visas. Gegorran desperately wanted to leave the planet before trouble could start but since he lacked a starport visa it was impossible to leave the city.\nGegorran was obviously nervous about the state of things in Iziz, affecting an overly friendly and enthusiastic manner to compensate. He repeatedly let slip that he was neither as generally happy nor as loyal to Vaklu as he claimed, prompting the Vaklu-loyal soldier posted at his store to warn him: \"Watch it, Geg. The captain already has enough complaints about you\".\nThe merchant also said that in addition to being unable to sell anything to anyone who did not have a starport visa, he had to sell to soldiers  at such steep discounts he was practically being robbed of his wares. He implied he had been threatened into doing this, but quickly denied it when the nearby soldier asked him about these comments.",
