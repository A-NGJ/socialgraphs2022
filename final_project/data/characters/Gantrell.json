 "content": "Gantrell was a male Human scientist who worked on Belsavis during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nAround 3641 BBY, he worked for the High Security Section and studied the Rakatan hyperspace power core until he was captured by Executor Krannus. Before his arrest, he was able to send a distress call to Pak Taldine after his capture. He was put in Vault S-31 and left to die. After the Hero of Tython arrived and killed an ancient Sithspawn called a terentatek, Gantrell was terrified and explained that Krannus intended to detonate the planet's core, which would result in a hyperspace shockwave that would consume Belsavis, its entire system and all of the adjacent star systems as well. Gantrell begged the Hero not to leave him in the dangerous vault, so the Jedi agreed to seal the doctor in one of the vault's secure chambers before heading deeper into the prison.",
