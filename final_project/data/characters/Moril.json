 "content": "Moril was a male Bothan smuggler who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Moril operated on Corellia and often worked for the Rogue CorSec. In 1 ABY, he was hired to smuggle animal feed, chemicals and tranquilizer materials to an illegal lab, specialized in bio-engineering creatures through dangerous genetic experiments. Moril was terrified by what he saw in the lab and later refused to discuss with anybody about that job. One of his contacts, Ja'inn, once tried to ask him about that and Moril was not able to hide his terror, displaying a very strange behavior. Ja'inn was worried and therefore reported this discussion to Lieutenant Joth of the Corellian Security Force. Joth thus sent a spacer to interrogate Moril. The Bothan agreed to give the details of his smuggling run, including the drop location for the shipment. This would led to the discovery of the illegal lab by the CorSec.\nMoril was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Moril was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
