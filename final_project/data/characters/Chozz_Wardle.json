 "content": "Chozz Wardle was the royal physician to the House of Lorac on the planet Velmor. When Prince Denid returned to his homeworld in 3 ABY, after nearly 20 years of exile, Wardle was the one to verify his identity. Although he knew that the ruling regent, Zelor would be displeased with the news, he declared Denid to be the long-lost son of King Lorac to the royal court. In his official report, Wardle stated his opinion that Denid would make a fine king. However, shortly after submitting his official report about Denid's identity, Zelor had Wardle and his entire staff executed.\nChozz Wardle first appeared in Star Wars  49, written by Mike W. Barr and released in 1981. In the comic, Wardle was illustrated by Walter Simonson. Although Wardle goes unidentified in his original appearance, his name was given in the 2003 Wizards of the Coast article Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion.",
