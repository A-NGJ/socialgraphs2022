 "content": "A Quermian was a member of the Path of the Open Hand cult around 382 BBY. Around that time, the Quermian was present at a almshouse dedicated to the Path on the moon Jedha and preached the teachings of the Mother to citizens of the Holy City. As the Jedi Vildar Mac and Matthea Cathley made their way to the Enlightenment bar, they came across the Quermian, who warned them to not disrupt their work. After a brief entanglement, Mac stated the two had no time for the incident and left. As they, the Quermian told them that the Jedi's time would come, and with a reckoning for anyone who sought to abuse the Force and bend it to their will.",
