Dol's brother Yeorg was also a member of the Bakuran Senate, and when Dol's daughter, Gaeriel expressed an interest in politics, Dol helped her achieve her wishes .\nA year after her daughter was accepted into the Academy, the Galactic Empire invaded Bakura. Both Dol and his wife were killed in the Bakuran capital city, Salis D'aar, when they accidentally were caught in a firefight between Imperial and Bakuran forces.",
