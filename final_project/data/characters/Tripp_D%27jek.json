 "content": "Tripp D'jek was a Human male who served in the army of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Tripp D'jek was a Rebel trooper in the army of the Rebel Alliance.\nIn 1 ABY, an accident took place in an Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nThe Rebel Alliance quickly discovered the accident on Dathomir and dispatched a small unit of Rebel troops, including Tripp D'jek, to investigate the Imperial Research and Prison Facility and rescue survivors. However, the Rebel forces were soon attacked by undead stormtroopers and suffered heavy casualties. When some Rebel soldiers started to display symptoms of the sickness, the evacuation missions were aborted and the few remaining Rebels were stuck in the Quarantine Zone. Tripp D'jek eventually took shelter in Camp Gamma, along with the Rodian Kyra 'Naa and the Bothan Oona Wran.\nLater, a spacer arrived at Camp Gamma and delivered a radio to Tripp D'jek. The radio was provided by the Imperial pilot Jeb Maris in Camp Alpha who had decided to establish communications between the camps. Once radios were delivered to the five camps in the Quarantine Zone, the survivors were able to safely coordinate high altitude supply drops sent from outside the Quarantine Zone.\nTripp D'jek was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tripp D'jek was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
