 "content": "Deyd Llnewe was an Imperial captain just prior to the Battle of Yavin. He was in command of the Carrack-class cruiser Vigilant.\nDuring his time in the Imperial Academy he dreamed of a glorious career. Instead, his path had led him to his insignificant posting, the dazzling aspirations of his youth given way to the harsh reality of a man grown old in menial service to his masters, leaving Deyd a frustrated man.\nAround the time of the Battle of Yavin, he intercepted a blockade runner called Jaina's Light, captained by one Han Solo. Suspicious of Solo but finding nothing unusual with his ship, Llnewe decided to let him go on his way. However, two further encounters with the smuggler on his way to deliver cargo to farmers on Nadiem made him increasingly paranoid, much to the chagrin of his second-in-command, Lieutenant Raprice.\nAt his wits' end, the captain realized that his ship had never encountered Han on his way to pick up his cargo. The Corellian wasn't using his ships to smuggle contraband; he was smuggling the starships themselves. Enraged, Llnewe ordered his gunners to open fire, but Solo was able to escape into hyperspace, content in the knowledge that his feat would become the stuff of smuggling legend.",
