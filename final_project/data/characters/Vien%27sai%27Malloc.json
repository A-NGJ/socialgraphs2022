 "content": "Vien'sai'Malloc was a female Devaronian senator who jointly represented Devaron Space in the Galactic Senate with her colleague, Elsah'sai'Moro.\nVien'sai'Malloc was known as one of the incorruptible senators in the Republic. However, this was not so; after the start of the Clone Wars, she disagreed with President Aven'sai'Ulrahk's policy of siding with the Republic, and secretly began establishing a Separatist base on the Blue Mountains, allowing the Confederate Navy to disrupt Republic resupply missions along the Corellian Trade Spine.\nSix months after the First Battle of Geonosis, Elsah discovered what her colleague was doing, and planned to tell the Jedi. Vien hired Aurra Sing to assassinate Elsah, as well as take care of the Jedi task force that had been sent to Devaron to investigate. When Jedi Knight Aayla Secura and Jedi Masters An'ya Kuro and Tholme went undercover, Vien revealed the coordinates of the Separatist base to Secura and was later arrested. Despite her wish for a trial by her peers in the Senate, President Aven'sai'Ulrahk sentenced her to death.",
