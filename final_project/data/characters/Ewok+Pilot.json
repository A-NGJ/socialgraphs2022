 "content": "Ewok Pilot, or simply E.P., was a character in comics by the same name, written and illustrated by Roan Novachez. He was a male Ewok who was a starfighter pilot. He flew alongside two other men who were training him. In later comics, he was joined by Jawa Pilot. Although they used to be enemies, partly due to Ewok Pilot being jealous of Jawa Pilot's popularity, they were later friends. His origins were explored in Ewok Pilot #1.\nFor his noble efforts in bringing Senator Blagotine to Coruscant, he was made a member of the Galactic Republic Defense Fleet.",
