 "content": "Gilly was a Human male who joined the Erased along with his twin brother, Spence after the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire by Emperor Palpatine. After the brothers engaged a band of robbers in 18 BBY, Gilly showed his skill with weapons to Solace. When stormtroopers attacked one of the bases, Gilly fought alongside his brother to defend the base, but they had no chance and were both shot down by concentrated fire.",
