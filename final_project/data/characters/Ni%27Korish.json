 "content": "Ni'Korish was a Hapan Queen Mother whose reign coincided with the early part of Palpatine's rule in the wider Galaxy.\nShe was known for her extreme anti-Jedi sentiments, regarding them as a closed elite who monopolised power through their magic, and her grandson Isolder believed that if any Jedi had tried to hide in the Hapes Cluster during the Jedi Purge, she would have enjoyed destroying them.\nNi'Korish had several daughters, including Ta'a Chume, who succeeded her as ruler, and Secciah. Because of her opposition to the Jedi, she gave her name to a clandestine faction which rose to prominence on Hapes during the Yuuzhan Vong War, opposed to renewed Jedi influence, and specifically to the succession of Ta'a Chume's Force-sensitive granddaughter Tenel Ka.",
