 "content": "Mnek was a male Jawa who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Mnek and two other Jawas, Hadiir and Izzar, worked as scrap merchants during the conflict, traveling the galaxy and offering a wide variety of valuable items.\nHadiir, Izzar, and Mnek were first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the Digital Expansion Galactic Strongholds, which was released in 2014. The three Scrap Vendors allow players to acquire crafting materials relatively easily in exchange for Jawa Scrap, which is awarded through the Conquest system and from the Cartel Market. Mnek accepts the \"Assorted Droid Parts\" currency for \"Prototype Materials,\" the semi-rare blue-level crafting materials. The trio can be found on either faction's Fleet in the Cartel Bazaar, and are also available as decorations for Strongholds.",
