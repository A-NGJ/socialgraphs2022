 "content": "The father of Nyranos was a Kaleesh male who destroyed an embassy of the Galactic Republic on the planet Kashyyyk sometime well before the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire. The Kaleesh was convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment on the planet Belsavis, along with his son Nyranos. Though Nyranos was not guilty of any crime, Warden Playt refused to grant parole to Nyranos or the descendants of any other prisoners.\nNyranos's father was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the group known as the Condemned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. Nyranos's dialogue in the game itself conflicts with the Codex entry; he speaks of talking with his grandfather, but the Codex establishes that Nyranos was born after his father was imprisoned on Belsavis.",
