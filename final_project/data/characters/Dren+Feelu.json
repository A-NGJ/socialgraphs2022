 "content": "Dren Feelu was a Human male moisture farmer who lived on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDren Feelu appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game. The game's creature database erroneously identifies this character with the droid name MX-C1.",
