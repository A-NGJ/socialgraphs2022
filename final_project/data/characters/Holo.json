 "content": "\"Holo\" was the nickname of a non-binary human who served as an ace pilot in the First Order by 35 ABY. Holo piloted a red TIE/ba interceptor and wore a matching First Order TIE flight suit. At some point, they participated in a skirmish within the Dassal system that involved other starfighters of the TIE line. Holo had light skin, brown eyes, and brown hair pulled back into a ponytail. Although skillful, they were not as skilled as fellow pilot Major Elrik Vonreg.\nHolo was first mentioned in \"A Legend Reborn,\" a post by Fantasy Flight Games detailing an upcoming expansion for the Star Wars: X-Wing miniatures game on August 8, 2019. The expansion, Major Vonreg's TIE Expansion Pack, was released on January 31, 2020, and included a card representing Holo. Their first appearance was in the mobile game Star Wars: Starfighter Missions, which released on November 19 later that year. Via Twitter, Fantasy Flight Games freelance writer Brooks Flugaur-Leavitt stated that they intended for the character to be non-binary.",
