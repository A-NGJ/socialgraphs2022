 "content": "A Rodian with green skin and black eyes served onboard a freighter owned by Noggox the Hutt. In 21 BBY, the Rodian was at the controls of the ship, along with a Human. Their cargo was droid brains and their destination the Fondor Shipyards when it was intercepted near Shipwrights' Trace by a pirate ship. The pirates attacked and knocked out two of the freighter's thrusters and its deflector shield generator. The pirate captain, Dool Pundar, then ordered the freighter to surrender, and sent B1-Series battle droids to secure it. The Rodian then joined the crew in an escape pod as Pundar absconded with the freighter. The crew was later safely recovered.\nThe Rodian appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions series.",
