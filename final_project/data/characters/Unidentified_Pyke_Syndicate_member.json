 "content": "A Pyke was a member of the Pyke Syndicate during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, they served under the gangster Omel Sampak and was present with Sampak aboard the space station Accretion Disco when Sampak hired out the station to celebrate a victory over a rival. The Pyke then hired the bounty hunter T'onga and her crew to keep Sampak and his entourage alive as they celebrated. When the crew arrived at the Accretion Disco, the Pyke met with them at their ship and led them to Sampak, who was unimpressed with who the Pyke had hired for the job. The Pyke then informed Sampak that T'onga's crew were the only ones who were desperate enough to take the job at such short notice. Not long after, assassins from Nar Kanji crashed the party in an attempt to exact revenge for Sampak's attack. During the ensuing fight, T'onga ordered the former pit fighter Tasu Leech to take the Pyke and Sampak to a safe room. After they arrived, they were confronted by several assassins.",
