 "content": "Barbo was a small-time Gran vendor in Mos Espa in 32 BBY who owned a mechanical shop and dealt generally with podracer parts such as fuel converters and servo control systems.\nHe met Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn who was looking to trade for parts that Anakin Skywalker needed to fix his podracer in order to compete in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Barbo suggested that Jinn talk to D'zor, a resident outlaw who, along with his thugs, camped outside Barbo's shop. He allowed Jinn access to the back of his shop, a move that put the Jedi's life at risk when D'Zor and his thugs attacked Jinn, who was forced to kill them in self-defense as well as destroy a repeating blaster that D'zor kept for protection. Jinn then took the fuel converter.\nBarbo appears in 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game, where he was voiced by Tom Kane. The player, in the guise of Jinn, may interact with Barbo in the town to acquire parts. This article assumes that the player did so. The player also has the option of using a mind trick on Barbo to acquire a part, and although Barbo acts as if he is agreeing to it, the game prevents him from following through.",
