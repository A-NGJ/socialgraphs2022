 "content": "Amyva Va'new was an female Ithorian cook, who lived in Nashal on the planet Talus during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn about 1 ABY, a spacer approached Va'new on the advice of the Human Hunde Decan, to try and find out how to repair a Corellian Fried Ice Cream Fryer. Va'new told the spacer to that Mikfa Faaus, a Gungan who lived on Naboo, might be able to give them more information about the fryer.\nAmyva Va'new is a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, she can be found near the Nashal starport. She is part of the quest line \"Find out more about the Cooker\"  that starts when the player inspects a broken ice cream fryer. The player then has to talk to several NPCs on different planets to gather more information about the fryer. When he finishes the quest, the player is rewarded with a schematic for a Corellian Fried Ice Cream Fryer.\nThe quest line was added to the game with Chapter 9 in April 2008",
