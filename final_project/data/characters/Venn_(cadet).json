 "content": "Venn was a human male cadet of the Galactic Empire who was stationed aboard the Executor, the flagship of Darth Vader, during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the Executor was present above the planet Jekara when it was attacked by the Hutt Clan. As the battle unfolded, Venn's commander and all of his fellow cadets was killed, which left Venn unsure of what to do. Venn eventually encountered the bounty hunter Beilert Valance on the ships seventeenth level, and believing Valance to be a Hutt, attempted to arrest him in the name of the Emperor, but was talked out of doing so by the bounty hunter. Shortly after, the compartment that contained the pair was vacced on the orders of Lieutenant Jyala Haydenn and Venn was sucked into space.",
