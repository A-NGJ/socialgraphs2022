 "content": "Trizz'mal the Merciless was a male Trandoshan pirate captain living during the Galactic War. Around 3640 BBY he became an officer of the Voidwolf's personal strike fleet and later volunteered himself to command it, boasting that his ship was the terror in the skies over twenty planets. After the Voidwolf got killed by a smuggler, Trizz'mal pledged himself to the newly proclaimed Voidhound. He died however in the following fight with the Imperial fleet.\nIf the player chooses Light Side options and orders captains to attack the Empire, Trizz'mal dies in battle. Otherwise, he survives.",
