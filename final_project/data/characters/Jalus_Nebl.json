 "content": "Jalus Nebl was a male Sullustan who was working as a freighter pilot for the Besadii Hutts' spice operation on Ylesia at the same time as Han Solo.\nWhen Han first came to Ylesia he asked Jalus several questions; one of them was why the Sullustan was unable to fly. Jalus told him that he was allergic to the spice he had been hired to ship. Once he had healed sufficiently to travel off-planet, Han and Jalus brought a message and a gift to Nal Hutta for Jiliac. The Sullustan would later save Han, Bria Tharen, and Muuurgh from being captured by the CR90 corvette Helot's Shackle by flying the Ylesian Dream, the freighter attached to the operation, through its tractor beam. He later renamed the ship Dream of Freedom after he had fled from Ylesia and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He died in the Battle of Ylesia, where he and three other Rebel landing craft were taken by surprise and shot down by the recently-installed turbolaser in Colony One.",
