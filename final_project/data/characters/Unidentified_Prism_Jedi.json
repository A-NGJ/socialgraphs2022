 "content": "This individual was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as the warden of the clandestine prison facility known as The Prism.\nA Force-sensitive Human, she was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Due to the Confederacy's employment of Force-users and other dangerous beings during the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council found it necessary to reopen an ancient prison facility known as The Prism. Assigning her to the facility in secret to replace Master Skein, the warden of the clandestine space station was attended by one hundred security droids to assist in the day to day operations of the facility.\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Order and the Republic were destroyed by the Galactic Empire, the Sith-run government which replaced the Republic as the leading power in the galaxy. Unaware of the regime change, the Jedi warden welcomed the next shuttle arriving at the facility as a friendly vessel. Expressing relief at seeing a visitor, she was cut down by Sith Lord Darth Vader before she was even able to reach for her lightsaber. Vader came to the facility in order to heal the gravely injured Emperor, who had been weakened during a coup of Coruscant by General Gentis. He ended up using the warden's prisoners to help take back Coruscant, though all but one were executed after their victory.",
