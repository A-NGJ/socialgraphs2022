 "content": "A male Anomid Jedi was a companion of the Jedi Master Vannar Treece's during the New Sith Wars. As with many Anomids, he was born without vocal cords and had to wear a vocalizer mask when communicating with non-Amonids. This Anomid Jedi was known to wield a blue lightsaber. In 1032 BBY, he took part in Operation Influx, an ill-fated Jedi mission to sabotage baradium production in the Daimanate, a fiefdom in the Grumani sector ruled by the Sith Lord Daiman. During the Raid on Chelloa, the Anomid Jedi and several of his companions were killed during an attack by the rival Sith Lord Odion, whose kinetic corruptor destroyed a large area of the spaceport and surrounding town. The sole Jedi survivor of this mission was Kerra Holt, a novice Jedi Knight who would play an important part in the Chelloan affair.",
