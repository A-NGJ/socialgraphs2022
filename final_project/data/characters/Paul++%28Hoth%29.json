 "content": "Paul was a male Human citizen of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. At some point around 3642 BBY he was captured by the White Maw pirates and was put to work in Firefrost Lavaworks, run by a cruel boss Gradak Ungan, who chained slaves to their equipment and as punishment cut off their thermal shield, leading them to die. When a bounty hunter visited the Lawaworks on a mission to kill Ungan, Paul begged him to get the key from their shackles so that the prisoners could make a run for it. He offered his thermal shield to make it happen, ready to sacrifice himself for the other prisoners.\nPaul appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Bounty Hunter class mission on Hoth as \"Republic Prisoner.\" His name is only mentioned by a fellow Imperial prisoner in one of the possible dialogue branches.",
