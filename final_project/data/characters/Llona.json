 "content": "Llona was a female Human who served as an Ensign in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, she was stationed on board the Imperial Star Destroyer Devastator where she was assigned to assist Colonel Kell Bircher when command of the ship was transferred to him from Darth Vader. Bircher however was already well acquainted with the starship and deemed her help unneeded in that area, instead reassigning her to serve him on a permanent basis. Her first assignment from Bircher was to learn if Darth Vader had left the Devastator or not.\nLlona first appeared in the Star Wars  2 of the comic book series simply titled \"Star Wars\" published by Dark Horse Comics. The issue was written by Brian Wood, illustrated by Carlos D'Anda and colored by Gabe Eltaeb. It was released on February 13 2013.",
