 "content": "Nym's Girlfriend was a female pharple native to the planet Lok that lived during the Galactic Civil War. It was named after the leader of the Lok Revenants Nym by a rival group, the Sulfur Lake Pirates. The beast was captured and tamed by the Sulfur Lake Pirates after the Battle of Yavin and kept in their hideout on Lok. The pirates named the flightless bird after the leader of their enemies as a means by which to humiliate him. As such, an underling of Nym's named Grenz Zittoun tasked a spacer to kill the embarrassing creature. In 1 ABY, the Lok Revenants raided the Sulfur Lake Pirate Hideout in order to retrieve the memory module of an Imperial droid. During the assault, a spacer attacked and killed the pharple so that it could no longer serve as a derisive symbol.\nNym's Girlfriend appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Nym's Girlfriend was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
