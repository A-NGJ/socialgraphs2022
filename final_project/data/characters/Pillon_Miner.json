 "content": "Pillon Miner was a male Human who lived during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Miner was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong, a species that had invaded the galaxy, and was forced to work on a seedship, a type of Yuuzhan Vong freighter. In 28 ABY, Miner was grievously injured when he mistakenly walked into a grove of maturing amphistaffs, organic Yuuzhan Vong weapons. Fellow slave and Jedi Knight Jacen Solo tried to help Miner, who was dying from peritonitis, but was unable to do so.\nMiner was mentioned in the 2002 novel The New Jedi Order: Traitor, which is part of the The New Jedi Order series. Traitor was written by Matthew Stover. In 2008, Miner received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
