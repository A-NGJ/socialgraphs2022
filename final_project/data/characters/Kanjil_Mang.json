 "content": "Doctor Kanjil Mang was a female Ishi Tib anthropologist.\nDoctor Kanjil Mang was an anthropologist working out of the University of Tibrin. She specialized in studying alien cultures, focusing on smaller societies. One of her studies, examining transplanted primitive enclave societies in industrial settings, led her to study the Ugnaught tribes on Cloud City.\nOver the course of a year, Mang's studies allowed her to become an honorary member of both the Irden and Botrut tribes. She is familiar with the Ugnaught warrens throughout the Mining Quarter and is an expert on the subject of Ugnaught culture and art.\nMang was a short, even-tempered and calm Ishi Tib who spoke with a soft guttural voice and a habit of speaking with her flukes.\nSpending a lot of time in the dry areas of the Mining Quarter was rough on the Ishi Tib skin, causing Mang to spend several hours in the more humid environment of Cloud City's upper tourist levels drinking and bathing.\nMang carried a comlink and datapad, and owned a secretary droid.",
