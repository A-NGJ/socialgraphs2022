 "content": "Mici Shabandar was a Human female operative of the Rebel Alliance who aided Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa during the Galactic Civil War.\nMici Shabandar accompanied Organa and Skywalker on a mission to steal the Staraker prototype starship from Foundry. A skilled computer techno and droid mechanic, Mici used forged systech level 7 passes to get her and R2-D2 close to the docking bay containing the Staraker. Once there the astromech droid pretended to malfunction and spray foam at the stormtroopers guarding the entrance.\nMici was injured when the Staraker crash-landed on Alashan. Due to her injuries, she had to remain behind aboard the crashed Imperial prototype with R2-D2 and C-3PO while Luke and Leia and Imperial commandos scouted the planet.\nShe was one of the few people Artoo-Detoo trusted to perform service modifications on him besides Luke.\nMici wore tech coveralls and kept her hair up with a bandanna, preferring to maintain a nondescript, utilitarian appearance when on duty.",
