 "content": "Acer Ash was a male Human black market trader who was affiliated with the Whiplash resistance group. Following the capture of Thi Xon Yimmon—the leader of the Whiplash—by the Galactic Empire around 18 BBY, Ash became part of the Whiplash Council, which took over the leadership of the group during Yimmon's absence. Ash became close to fellow Council member Tuden Sal and he supported Sal's plans to have the Whiplash stage an attempt on the life of Emperor Palpatine, the leader of the Empire, by assaulting the Emperor's Villa on the planet Coruscant. However, the attack was crushed by the defending Imperial forces and Ash perished during the raid, along with the bulk of the Whiplash's operatives on Coruscant.",
