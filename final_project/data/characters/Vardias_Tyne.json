 "content": "Vardias Tyne was a Human male who lived in the town of Anchorhead on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War. While there, he faced trouble with the Dim-U monks, after having killed a bantha that was destroying his vaporators.\nDuring 1.5 ABY, Vardias Tyne resided in the town of Anchorhead on Tatooine. While here, he ended up killing a bantha that was destroying his vaporators. Unfortunately for Vardias, the bantha-worshipping Dim-U monks learned of this, and sent a female Zabrak bounty hunter named Rhalia Jinsari to kill Vardias Tyne.\nIn need of help, Vardias encountered a spacer passing through Anchorhead. After explaining his plight, the spacer agreed to hunt down and kill the bounty hunter, who was just approaching town. Fortunately for Vardias, the spacer succeeded in killing the bounty hunter.\nHowever, Vardias knew his troubles were not yet over. He knew that the Dim-U would simply send another bounty hunter when they learned of Jinsari's demise. In order to calm down the Dim-U, Vardias had a talented artist sculpt a bantha statue out of a piece of kiliad marble. He tasked the spacer who had helped him earlier with deliving the bantha statue to Brother Chonar, with the hope that they would forgive and forget the killing of the bantha. The spacer agreed, and sought out to find Chonar who was just outside of Anchorhead. When Chonar received the statue, he told the spacer that the statue conveyed the respect for the majestic bathas. He informed the spacer that the Dim-U would no longer pursue Vardias Tyne. When the spacer informed Vardias of the news, he thanked the spacer and gave away his shellfish harvesting tool which he used to use in the rivers of Naboo. He admitted that it had little use on Tatooine, but that the spacer may have a use for it.\nVardias Tyne was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Players who performed a series of quests for Vardias in Anchorhead had to hunt down and kill Rhalia Jinsari outside the town, and then deliver a bantha statue to Chonar. Although the player could choose not to do Vardias Tyne's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.",
