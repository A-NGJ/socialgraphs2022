 "content": "Frane was a male Rutanian who was the King of Rutan and the father of Leed and Taroon. He often had mood swings and could quickly loose his temper.\nThe laws of Rutan and Senali required that the kings of the planet and the moon exchange their firstborn offspring when they were seven years old, in order to avoid a war. When Leed was kidnapped by some accomplices of Taroon, Frane blamed the Senali, but eventually his son was rescued. Later, Leed, Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Rutan to negotiate with him where his son should stay. Then, they tried to free Yaana, King Meenon's daughter, from Frane's oppressions. After finding Yaana, Frane would not let her go if no Senali stayed on Rutan, so Drenna volunteered to do it. Finally, King Frane accepted Leed's wish to stay in Senali and agreed with Taroon to be his successor and the future King of Rutan.",
