 "content": "Ghar Bodya was a male Houk warlord who was a member of the Exchange, acting on the desert planet of Tatooine during the time of the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, an individual hired by Shayl Tasao, the representative of the Exchange consortium on Tatooine, to kill Ghar Bodya. The Houk killed a Sith apprentice sent to assassinate him, and the Imperial retaliation was costing all of them.\nThe individual hired to this job first crushed all the forces loyal to Bodya, and then lured him to the Dune Sea by destroying his water supplies at some derelict sandcrawlers. Bodya was defeated there and, as proof of his death, the individual in question took his head off and showed it to Tasao.",
