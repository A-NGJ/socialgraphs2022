 "content": "Bhoggihalysahonues was a female Oswaft who served as one of three Elders of her massive, vacuum-breathing species during the Imperial Period. In 3 BBY, Bhoggihalysahonues led a delegation of 1,000 Oswaft to negotiate with an Imperial fleet that had arrived in the Oswaft's native ThonBoka, despite significant opposition from other Elders who distrusted the Empire's intentions. Their concerns were proven right when the Imperial fleet opened fire on Bhoggihalysahonues and the other Oswaft as soon as they entered rangeâ€”although Bhoggihalysahonues and her cohort destroyed the cruiser Courteous, it came at the cost of every single one of their lives.",
