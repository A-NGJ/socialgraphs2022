 "content": "Gett was a clone trooper commander who served in the 41st Elite Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic, assigned to Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan. He served with Clone Commander CC-1004, another clone commander in the 41st, who at some point during the War introduced him to the writings of Wilhuff Tarkin, a captain in the Republic Navy. Unlike most clones, he did not consider his Jedi General to be an omnipotent warrior, and Etain liked and respected him for that.\nGett was the commanding officer of the Acclamator-class assault ship Fearless one year after the Battle of Geonosis. He personally commanded Improcco Company over the planet Dinlo, and respected Tur-Mukan's decision to not leave Sarlacc Battalions A and B during the Skirmish at Dinlo, personally accompanying her to rescue them.\nAlong with the rest of the 41st, Gett was deployed to the planet Kashyyyk in 19 BBY to take part in the battle to prevent the Separatists capturing the native Wookiee city of Kachirho. During the battle, the 41st were deployed by Jedi Grand Master Yoda in a counter-charge against Separatist forces advancing out of the Wartaki Sea up a beach head toward the city. They successfully managed to repel the invaders with the aid of the Wookiees, but took heavy casualties in doing so.\nDuring the battle, Order 66, an order from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to execute the Jedi, was issued and Gett, believing the Jedi had betrayed the Republic turned on the Jedi along with the rest of the clone army. Several Jedi on Kashyyyk were successfully killed, along with many others across the galaxy, but Gett learned that Yoda had escaped, killing Gree in the process and turning the Wookiees against the Republic. After several days of fighting their former Wookiee allies, Gett and the 41st established peace on Kashyyyk, and were then reformed into the 41st Stormtrooper Legion in service to the new Galactic Empire. In 15 BBY, Gett held the rank of Stormtrooper commander and gave a orientation seminar to a group of Imperial cadets, in which he spoke about his experience at Kashyyyk.\nGett is the Mando'a word for \"nut.\"",
