 "content": "Esu was a Gand bounty hunter who operated during the Clone Wars. In about 21 BBY, Esu was captured by the Galactic Republic and imprisoned by the Galactic Republic alongside various other bounty hunters aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tempestuous for transport to the planet Coruscant. During the voyage, the bounty hunter Arlain Zee escaped from his cell and freed Esu and several other hunters. Zee, Esu, and the bounty hunters Volan Das, Kessk and M-1991 attempted to make their way to the ship's hangar bay and flee the vessel, but they were soon recaptured by Republic clone troopers.",
