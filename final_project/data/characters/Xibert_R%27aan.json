 "content": "Xibert R'aan was a male Bith from Clak'dor VII, who distributed deathsticks during the Clone Wars.\nIn 21 BBY, he was arrested by the Galactic Republic for selling deathsticks and was taken from M'Bardi to Coruscant with 49 dangerous criminals. While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. R'aan decided to help and helped repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid will affect their parole.",
