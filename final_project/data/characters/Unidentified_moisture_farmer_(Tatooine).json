 "content": "A moisture farmer resided on the planet Tatooine for an unknown period of time. He was seen at Mochot Steep where he spoke with Conil Barje around 32 BBY. He advised Barje that he, his wife, and child should have stayed on Corellia, rather than selling all of their possessions and relocating. While purchasing weapons to protect themselves from Tusken Raiders, this moisture farmer mentioned a time when he was in Anchorhead during a recent raid. He described the battle as bloody and he was barely able to make his escape when the Sand People burned down half of the city.\nShortly afterward, this farmer was killed in a raid on Mochot Steep.",
