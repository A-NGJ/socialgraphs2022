 "content": "V-Brose was a Human male who served as a Security Guide and guarded the Learning Circle school on the planet Kegan. In 44 BBY, he encountered the Jedi apprentices Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi—who were searching for a Force-sensitive girl named Olana Chion—while they were being punished by V-Tarz, another Security Guide. V-Brose promptly stopped V-Tarz's punishment, but he refused to believe that the two Jedi were visitors to the planet as they claimed, gave them three marks toward a punishment, and had V-Tarz take the two Jedi apprentices to class.\nV-Brose was a Human male Security Guide serving on the planet Kegan as a guard at the Learning Circle school, which taught The Learning, a curriculum designed to keep Keganites isolated from the outside galaxy and dedicated to their homeworld. While on a mission to Kegan in 44 BBY with Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Adi Gallia to find a Force-sensitive girl named Olana Chion, Jedi apprentices Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi found themselves in trouble outside the Learning Circle school after talking back to a Security Guard named V-Tarz. As a result, V-Tarz threw the two Jedi apprentices to the ground and placed his boot on Kenobi's head.\nHowever, V-Brose happened upon the altercation and demanded to know what had happened. V-Tarz explained that he had thrown the pair to the ground for resisting capture, though the Jedi claimed that they were not students but visitors to Kegan. In response, V-Brose explained to V-Tarz that physical force was not to be used on students, as The Learning was based on love, not fear. V-Tarz relented as instructed, which prompted the Jedi to again explain that they were not Keganites. Despite the protests of the two Jedi, V-Brose still believed that they were lying, informed them that no one visited Kegan, and gave them three marks toward a punishment before having V-Tarz take them to class.\nV-Brose believed in The Learning curriculum, which taught Keganites misleading facts about other planets and species in an effort to keep them loyal to their own planet and isolated from the rest of the galaxy. While V-Brose punished students for going against The Learning, he also made sure that the punishments dealt by other Security Guides followed the curriculum's methods.\nAs part of his Security Guide uniform, V-Brose wore a navy-colored chromasheath tunic.\nV-Brose was created by Jude Watson for the novel Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth, which was released in August 2000 as a part of the Jedi Apprentice series.",
