 "content": "Oga Garra was the female Blutopian proprietor of Oga's Cantina, a drinking establishment in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu, and was also the local crime boss. Garra was an orphan who was raised by the Hutts. She had leathery gray skin, and the pink-tinged mouth tentacles characteristic of her species.\nOga took great pride in her cantina and the prestige she had. She was always looking for ways to improve her business and was involved in almost all commerce that took place in Black Spire Outpost. Although infrequently seen about, Garra's reputation had grown to almost mythic proportions, and she was feared and respected by all the locals. She was interested almost exclusively in keeping matters within the outpost running smoothly and did not identify with the Resistance or the First Order. Her office was located underneath the cantina in Black Spire Outpost, and she kept a pet tooka-cat therein.",
