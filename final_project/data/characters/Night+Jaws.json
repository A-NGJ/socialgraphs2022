A high-ranking member of his species who had earned a name of his own, the Night Jaws led the Esh-kha worshippers in the Esh-kha sanctuary, a Rakata vault in the Power Center cavern taken over by the Esh-kha during the invasion of Belsavis, but was slain by Imperial forces who looted the sanctuary's symbol.\nThe Night Jaws is the target of the final stage of \"The Esh-kha Sanctuary,\" an Area mission for Imperial players on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
