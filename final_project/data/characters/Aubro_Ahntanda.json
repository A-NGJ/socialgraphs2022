 "content": "Aubro Ahntanda was a male Sullustan slaver who operated the Ahntanda slaving ring.\nAubro was a slaver who operated on and around the planet Kluistar and had a business relationship with Sibarra the Hutt that allowed him to even kidnap people out of the Ace of Sabres casino.\nHe was cold-blooded, cruel and utterly devoid of morals. He viewed slaves as nothing more than merchandise and was notorious for torturing reluctant slaves.\nAubro Ahntanda was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.\nHe was intended to be an antagonist for the player characters as they were investigating missing persons at or around the casino.",
