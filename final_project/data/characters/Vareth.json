 "content": "Vareth was a short female Human pilot under the employment of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure.\nVareth worked with the male Sullustan Garron. Garron used his recently deceased parents' life insurance in the purchase of the freighter Startled Circuit. They made their way to Tatooine, and Jabba's majordomo Bib Fortuna was impressed enough with Vareth and Garron's skills that he offered them employment as spacers in the Hutt's criminal organization.",
