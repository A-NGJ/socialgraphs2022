 "content": "Lucky was the name of a Rancor living in the Coronet Zoo on Corellia during the Galactic War. During the Battle of Corellia in 3640 BBY the zoo security was damaged and Lucky was among many wild creatures that escaped into the streets of Axial Park. Lucky was at some point infected by the madness from one of the Seeds of Rage, but before he could do any lasting damage he was killed by a group of individuals fighting in the area.  Lucky was known to harbor parasitic clingmosses.\nLucky appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic as a World Boss on Corellia.",
