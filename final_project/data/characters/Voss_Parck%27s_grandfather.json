 "content": "Voss Parck's grandfather was a Corulag native who received a commission in an unknown fleet and eventually rose to the position of captain of a capital ship. He fathered at least two children, one of them a son.\nAt least one of Parck's children followed in his footsteps, as his son also became a naval captain. Two of his grandchildren also served in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, one becoming a vice admiral in the Imperial Navy and the other, Voss Parck, holding the rank of captain until his promotion to admiral and placement in command of the Empire of the Hand.",
