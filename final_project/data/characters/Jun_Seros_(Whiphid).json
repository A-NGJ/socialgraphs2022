 "content": "Jun Seros was a Whiphid member of the Rebel Alliance, living in Mos Eisley, Tatooine. There he owned a diner, well known to provide hearty meals to tired travelers. He was forced to pay Jabba the Hutt to allow himself and his business to survive.\nShortly before Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at Mos Eisley, a group of Rebels delivered a datacard from Thel Erelen on Duro to the Whiphid. When he fell behind his protection money, he got their assistance in confronting the Hutt's hired thugs. Not long afterward, his establishment was searched by stormtroopers looking for an old spacer and his R4 unit. The Empire had come to Tatooine, searching for R2-D2 and C-3PO.\nIn 4 ABY, following Jabba's death, Jun sent Rebel agents into Jabba's Palace to recover as much of the crime lord's intelligence files as could be found.\nDishes served at his diner included womp rat stew , eopie briskets and bantha steaks. He often hired hands to hunt wild animals, in order to use their meat for his dishes. He claimed to have employed virtually every adventurer and spacer who had ever passed through Tatooine.\nNeither Jun Seros nor his diner are actually seen in Star Wars Galaxies, however a player can obtain his missions to hunt womp rats from the mission terminals on Tatooine.",
