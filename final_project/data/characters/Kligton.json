During the assault on Republic Outpost Shylon, his firefight with Republic's men under lieutenant Weggland was interrupted by arrival of the apprentice of Darth Baras, who was systematically dismantling Rathari's power base. The Sith Warrior ordered Kligton and his men to stand down, but the General choose to obey his standing orders and ordered an attack on the Sith, during which he was killed.",
