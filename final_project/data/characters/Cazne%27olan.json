 "content": "Cazne'olan was a Twi'lek and was one of the leaders of the Olan Clan in the city of Kala'uun on Ryloth.\nAn aged, thickset Twi'lek male with thin lekku and wrinkled pink skin, Olan was a contemporary of Nawara Ven and Koh'shak. He despised what his cousin Firith Olan had become and, when Firith came to him for shelter, made plans to sell his relative to the highest bidder. Cazne'olan orchestrated a negotiation between Rogue Squadron and Imperial Captain Marl Semtin, forcing Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles and Winter to battle Sixtus Quin and Septaas for information on Firith's and Eidolon Base's whereabouts.\nHowever, Cazne'olan showed that he believed crime did not pay—either for Firith or the Galactic Empire—by staging the battle in a virtual reality environment, in which all parties were consumed in a heat storm. The Empire came out the victor in the virtual game, with Sixtus securing the prize. However, Semtin secretly bribed his way into the upper levels of Kala'uun and took Firith, presumably without paying Cazne'olan his promised fee.\nLater, Cazne'olan was reunited with Antilles during Rogue Squadron's mission to procure ryll kor to aid in the fight against the Krytos virus. With a sense of mutual respect between the two from their earlier encounter, Cazne'olan supported Antilles in his negotiation with Kala'uun Starport master Koh'shak, and in the ensuing twi'janii, answered the squadron leader's questions on Twi'lek culture and conveyed to him the dancer Sienn'rha's offer of a private dance.",
