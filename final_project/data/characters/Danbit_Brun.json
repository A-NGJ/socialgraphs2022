 "content": "Danbit Brun was a human male lieutenant in the Galactic Empire who served as a shield relay systems operator onboard the Shield Gate positioned above the planet Scarif. His job required him to carefully monitor field dynamics to prevent dangerous build up from stellar wind aurorae. In 0 BBY, he was killed when the remnants of the Persecutor and the Intimidator, two Star Destroyers destroyed in the Battle of Scarif, drifted into the gate and destroyed it. Brun had fair skin and gray hair and wore a black version of the Imperial technician's uniform with a cap.\nDanbit Brun first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 15, 2016. He was not identified in the film, but was named by the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the day after the film.",
