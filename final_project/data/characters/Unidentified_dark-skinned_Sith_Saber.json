 "content": "A dark-skinned Human female Sith Saber was a member of the Lost Tribe of Sith on the planet Kesh. In 41 ABY, Sith Tyro Vestara Khai was summoned to the ruling Circle of Lords. When the Tyro arrived, the Sith Saber, Saber Shura, and another Saber greeted Khai, and Shura took Khai to the chamber of the Circle of Lords.\nA dark-skinned Human female was born on the remote planet Kesh around the time of the Second Galactic Civil War. A Force-sensitive, she was trained by the Lost Tribe of Sith, descendants of a group of Sith who had been stranded on Kesh thousands of years previously. By 41 ABY, she had attained the rank of Sith Saber. In that year, the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship arrived on the world and contacted the Sith Tyro Vestara Khai.\nKhai was then summoned before the Tribe's ruling council, the Circle of Lords, in the capitol building in the Kesh capital city of Tahv. There, the female Sith Saber awaited Khai alongside two fellow Sabers, Shura and a male Saber. When Khai arrived, the female Saber greeted the Tyro, and then Shura took Khai to the Lords in the Circle Chambers.\nThe dark-skinned female possessed the abilities required to achieve the rank of Sith Saber. Khai, a talented Sith Tyro, was unable to detect her presence until she heard the sound of the Saber's boots. The Saber was the first to speak to Khai while her two companions remained silent.\nThe dark-skinned Sith Saber appeared in the 2009 novel Fate of the Jedi: Omen, written by Christie Golden. The Saber serves as a minor character in the book.",
