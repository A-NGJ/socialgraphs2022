 "content": "Arrud Barsoomu was a male Twi'lek criminal who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Barsoomu was a member of Jabba the Hutt criminal organization and served as the crime lord's right hand enforcer in Mos Eisley. During that time, he recruited swoop gangs into Jabba's criminal empire and organized them to fight against Lady Valarian, the leader of the Valarian Syndicate and main rival of Jabba. In 1 ABY, members of the Valarian Syndicate defeated the swoopers of the Desert Banshees and discovered the involvement of Barsoomu in the swooper attacks against the Valarians. Lady Valarian therefore tasked a spacer with eliminating the Twi'lek. The spacer eventually found Arrud Barsoomu and two B'omarr monk bodyguards near Mos Eisley and killed them all in the ensuring firefight.\nArrud Barsoomu was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Arrud Barsoomu was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nBecause Arrud Barsoomu spawned under the generic \"assassin_twilek_male\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of three possible depictions and would fluctuate after each server reset. Nevertheless, he systematically appeared as a Twi'lek male.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Arrud Barsoomu was consequently removed from the game.",
