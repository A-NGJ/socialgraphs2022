 "content": "Ina was the grandmother of Tray.\nShe was retired in the worker world of Vorzyd IV, and this meant that anyone who did not work, died. Ina was lucky, because her granddaughter used to visit her and have a talk.\nThen, she attended the meeting where the workers and retired people would discuss the future with the Freelies. But suddenly, the building exploded, because Flip placed bombs there. Fortunately, she suffered reversible injuries.",
