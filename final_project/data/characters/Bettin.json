 "content": "Bettin was a yellow-skinned Human male who served as a sniper and exotic weapons expert member of Wraith Squadron in 13 ABY. He was present on a mission to Ryvester that eliminated Imperial Admiral Kosh Teradoc. Bettin tagged a gemologist, Mulus Cheems, who was being held captive by Teradoc, with a transmitter that gave Cheems instructions. The Wraiths then lured Teradoc out with an offer of a sculpted gem treasure. Teradoc took the treasure after having Cheems authenticate it, but the Wraiths rescued Cheems while Teradoc fled back to his base, where the sculpture—actually an explosives package of anthracite—detonated.",
