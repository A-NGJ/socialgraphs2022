 "content": "\"Howzer\" was a clone who served as a Clone Captain in the Grand Army of the Republic and eventually as a stormtrooper captain in a battalion of the Imperial Army, shortly after the Galactic Empire's formation in 19 BBY. Stationed on the planet Ryloth with his squad, he worked with Senator Orn Free Taa and the former Twi'lek Resistance leader General Cham Syndulla to help maintain peace on the planet. Howzer stood with Syndulla when he implored the former resistance members to trust the Empire's protection. Later, the captain returned Cham's daughter, Hera Syndulla, to the general after she was caught trespassing, choosing not to report the incident.\nAfter Hera and two Twi'lek Resistance fighters were caught smuggling weapons, Howzer arrived after their arrest and helped oversee their transportation. However, Cham and some other Twi'lek militants intercepted their HCVw A9 turbo tank to rescue their comrades. They defeated Howzer's forces and held the captain and his colleagues, Vice Admiral Rampart and Senator Taa, captive. Howzer advised against Cham killing Taa before Imperial reinforcements arrived and captured the Twi'leks excluding Hera. Rampart thus ordered the captain to find Hera.\nWith Hera having not been found, Howzer joined Rampart at Cham's prison cell, where the admiral exchanged barbs with the general and his wife. Rampart then ordered the captain to round up the Syndullas' supporters, although Howzer believed the arrests were unnecessary. Howzer soon joined the admiral for an address to the people of Ryloth. Not long after, the pair argued about the necessity of the arrests, as the captain feared an uprising. Howzer soon approached Cham's cell and requested Hera's location in order to protect her, only to be denied by Cham, who did not trust him.\nThe rogue elite clone unit known as the \"Bad Batch\" attacked Ryloth's Imperial doonium refinery, and Rampart left Howzer to guard the Capitol building in Ryloth's capital, Lessu. Members of the Bad Batch broke out Cham and his fighters, and Crosshair set a trap outside the Capitol after suspecting their breakout. Howzer stopped Cham's group from falling into the trap and confronted Crosshair's troops instead, openly defying the Imperial occupation of Ryloth and inspiring six other clones to join him. Crosshair had the rebellious clones arrested as a result.\n\"Howzer\" was created on the planet Kamino as a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve in the Galactic Republic's clone army during the Clone Wars against the Separatist Alliance. Holding the rank of Clone Captain, Howzer was deployed to the Outer Rim planet Ryloth, the homeworld of the Twi'lek species, to free the world from a Separatist occupation. The Republic and the native Twi'lek Resistance, led by General Cham Syndulla, eventually joined forces against the Separatists under the agreement that the Republic would withdraw from Ryloth after their common enemy was usurped. The coalition succeeded in overthrowing the Separatists on the world. Having taken part in the battle and then being stationed on world, Howzer eventually befriended Syndulla.\nIn 19 BBY, the Clone Wars came to an end with the fall of the Separatists and the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Howzer then continued to serve as a stormtrooper officer in the new Imperial Army, retaining his rank of captain. He led a squad of clones, all of whom had fought with him during the battle for Ryloth, within a battalion on the desert world. The Empire failed to leave Ryloth as the Republic had promised, and established its own doonium refinery on the world. Many Twi'leks became skeptical of Empire's military presence, including several of Syndulla's fighters, led by his lieutenant, Gobi Glie.\nIn Ryloth's capital city Lessu, many of the people gathered before the Capitol building, where Howzer was present at a balcony area. The captain spoke with Cham Syndulla while Ryloth's Senator, Orn Free Taa, conversed with Cham's wife Eleni. Vice Admiral Rampart, who had been viewing the crowd, questioned the loyalty of Ryloth to Taa, Eleni, and Cham, who each cooperated with the Empire's presence. As Taa went over with Rampart and Eleni to begin his speech, Howzer asked if Cham was okay, to which the general expressed worry about his people not embracing peace.\nHowzer assured Cham that Ryloth was safe as the Twi'lek fought for, and the pair joined their cohorts for the speech. Taa implored his people to step down from their military posts and allow the Empire's clones to protect them. With the crowd resenting Taa's request, Cham stepped in, expressing his trust for the clones who had helped the people of Ryloth during the Clone Wars. Cham waved Howzer up to join him during his speech, which was applauded by most of the audience.\nNot long after, Cham and Eleni's daughter, Hera, and her droid, C1-10P \"Chopper,\" were found in a restricted area near the Imperial refinery by some clones. Howzer and his troops returned the young Twi'lek to Cham, explaining what the general's daughter had done. After Hera dismissed the incident as \"exploring,\" the captain took Cham aside. Howzer explained that he was in a tough spot and promised not to report the incident, but said it could not happen again. Cham told Howzer that it would not and thanked him, who departed with his soldiers.\nMeanwhile, Rampart had his Elite Squad Trooper unit, led by Commander CT-9904 \"Crosshair,\" investigate Glie's operations. The unit soon intercepted the Twi'lek militant, who was accompanied by Hera and the Twi'lek Serin, when he returned to Ryloth with purchased weapons. Howzer joined Rampart and Taa aboard a HCVw A9 turbo tank which traveled to Crosshair's position with BARC speeder escorts. Disembarking, the captain flanked the admiral and senator, who inspected Hera and discussed what involvement her father Cham might have. When Rampart implied punishment for Hera, Howzer interjected, adding that she was only a child. Taa declared the girl an insurgent and ordered that the three captured Twi'leks be taken away.\nWhile hesitant, Howzer had Glie, Hera, and Serin taken into the Juggernaut, followed by the captain, Rampart, and Taa. The group sat inside as the transport traveled through Sector 3 of Ryloth's western outskirts, which was when Twi'lek reinforcements led by Cham and Eleni arrived. Cham began assaulting the escorting clones on speeder bikes, and Howzer was informed of the attack through his comlink. Knowing that Cham was behind the attack, Taa ordered Howzer's forces to fight back, and the captain complied after a moment of hesitation.\nHowzer listened over his comlink as his speeders outside were defeated in their attempts to fend off the Twi'lek militants. The comms were then jammed by the militant Lenk, who had hijacked the juggernaut's cockpit, and the transport came to a halt as the last of the speeder pilots were taken down, leading Howzer to put on his helmet. After the transport's power was cut, Howzer raised his DC-17 hand blaster to defend his colleagues, but Rampart advised him to stand down, and the juggernaut passengers watched as Cham and Eleni broke into their compartment.\nHowzer, Taa, Rampart and their remaining clones were held captive by the Twi'leks. Cham and Taa accused each other of treason, the general pointing his blaster at the senator. Howzer told Cham to think about what he was doing before Eleni talked the general out of killing Taa. Rampart then thanked the senator before nodding at a distant Crosshair, who shot Taa in the head. Several Low Altitude Assault Transports then flew in, forcing Hera to flee with Chopper in a landspeeder. The LAATs deployed additional clones alongside Crosshair's elite squad, who arrested the Twi'leks and loaded them onto the transports.\nAs Taa was carried away on a hoverlift, injured but alive, Howzer walked to the side of Rampart, who handed the clone a DC-15A blaster carbine and ordered him to find Hera. The captain then watched as Rampart joined Crosshair's Elite Squad Troopers and the captured Twi'leks aboard an LAAT, which took off with the other gunships. With the efforts to locate Hera being unsuccessful, Howzer returned to Rampart at the Capitol building, where the pair visited Cham and Eleni Syndulla in their prison cell. The admiral and the Syndullas exchanged taunts before the former walked away, leaving Howzer to look somberly at his old Twi'lek friends before departing as well.\nHowzer and Rampart went towards the landing area outside the Capitol, and the admiral ordered the clone captain to arrest the Syndullas' supporters across the planet. The captain insisted that the people he was to arrest were not insurgents, but Rampart said that they supported one, recalling the attack on the juggernaut and the shooting of Taa. Stating that he had been there, Howzer argued that Taa had not been shot by the Twi'leks, but when the admiral asked who the clone thought had fired, Howzer said he did not know. Rampart reminded him of his orders, and Howzer offered to find Hera himself, but Rampart denied his request, saying that another squad was looking for her.\nNumerous Twi'leks at Lessu gathered for another public address at the Capitol building, where Rampart, flanked by Howzer, updated the crowd on the supposed assassination attempt on Taa by the Syndullas and their allies. After, the pair traversed the hallways of the building, with Howzer suggesting only some of Cham's allies be arrested. Rampart insisted that all were to be rounded up, and the captain expressed worry that it could incite an uprising. The admiral, though, offered the solution that more would therefore be arrested to quell a rebellion. The two entered Rampart's office to join Crosshair, who reported the presence of the rogue clone commando squad Clone Force 99, or the \"Bad Batch,\" on Ryloth.\nRampart and Crosshair debated about the Bad Batch's capabilities until the former suggested Crosshair's squad continue to search for Hera or the admiral would put Howzer on the task instead, leading the commander to leave the room to carry out his orders. Howzer went back to Cham and Eleni's cell in secret. Cham claimed the captain had sided against the general and his people, but Howzer brought up Cham's attack on the juggernaut. When Eleni stated that she and her husband had to protect Hera, the clone captain asserted that he wanted to as well, asking for their daughter's location and promising to help the girl. However, Cham did not trust Howzer, and turned his offer down.\nNot long after, the Imperial refinery was attacked by the Bad Batch with the help of Hera. Learning of the events, Howzer rushed to Rampart's office to report it to the admiral, who ordered the captain to guard Lessu. Imperial forces deployed from the Capitol building's landing area, but Crosshair stopped his elite squad in suspicion that the Capitol was the real target. Howzer observed their shuttle from one of the building's balconies, and learned of a trap that Crosshair had set in front of one of the exits with his elite squad and members of Howzer's squad. The captain then went down towards the exit and intercepted Cham and his allies, who had been rescued by two Bad Batch commandos.\nHowzer warned the group of Crosshair's trap and condemned the Empire's actions on Ryloth. After the captain added that all the Capitol's exits were blocked, Eleni decided the group would steal Taa's shuttle from the senator's private tower hangars. Howzer apologised to Cham for not going against the Empire sooner, and the general promised to return to Ryloth eventually as their fight for Ryloth's freedom was not over. Although Eleni added that the clone's actions would be discovered, Howzer wished to not abandon his squad.\nHowzer exited the capitol building before Crosshair's trap and openly defied the Empire's occupation of Ryloth, imploring his clone brothers to stand with him and do the same as he threw down his blaster carbine. Six other clones were persuaded by Howzer's reasoning and dropped their blasters and shields, prompting Crosshair to order their arrests by his Elite Squad and the clones who were not convinced. Being handcuffed, Howzer watched as Cham and his fighters escaped with the Bad Batch on Taa's shuttle. The clone was then escorted into the Capitol building.\nAs a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, Howzer was 1.83 meters tall and had tan-colored skin and dark brown hair which was shaven short at the sides. He also had a scar on his left cheek and the right side of his chin.\nAlthough most clones were blindly compliant to orders following the activation of their behavioral modification biochips, Howzer retained his individuality despite having a chip, remaining friendly with Cham Syndulla. With the effects of his chip wearing off, and therefore allowing him to question his purpose, he upheld his swear to protect Ryloth, and was skeptical when the Empire undermined its predecessor's promise to leave Ryloth after the Separatists' defeat. Howzer found Vice Admiral Rampart's undermining of Cham and his people deplorable, and was hesitant to carry out orders which pitted him against Ryloth's people, including not reporting Hera Syndulla's trespassing incident.\nWhen Rampart ordered punishment for Hera, Howzer argued that she was just a child, noticeably hesitating when his men were ordered to arrest her and her companions. He also chose to try and talk Cham out of shooting Orn Free Taa to help the general. The captain was skeptical of Rampart's decision to arrest all of Cham's allies, believing it to be excessive and fearing a resulting uprising. Howzer felt guilty about having to turn against Cham, but tried to make amends with him by pledging to protect Hera Syndulla. After assisting the Twi'lek fighters in escaping, Howzer decided to stay with his fellow clone brothers whom he respected, not wishing to abandon them and well aware that he would be detained for treason.\nHaving been out in the field when other clones removed the color from their armor, and then simply never doing so himself, Howzer wore white Phase II clone trooper armor with teal blue markings and a teal blue pauldron. He also used a comlink built into his armor and wielded a DC-17 hand blaster and DC-15A blaster carbine.\n\"Howzer\" first appeared in \"Devil's Deal,\" the eleventh episode of the Disney+ animated series Star Wars: The Bad Batch which was directed by Steward Lee and aired on July 9, 2021. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, the voice of every clone trooper in The Bad Batch and other animated series including Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Prior to the release of \"Devil's Deal,\" a figure for Howzer was displayed for pre-order as part of \"The Bad Batch Special 4-pack\" in Hasbro Inc.'s Star Wars: The Vintage Collection. The pack identified him as \"Ballast.\"\nMolly Denmark's lighting concept art for Howzer's speech at the Capitol depicted the captain with navy blue helmet markings and pauldron, instead of teal blue, as well as a visor resembling that from Imperial stormtrooper armor. Howzer's chest and leg armor also lacked any color markings.",
