 "content": "Idis was a Human male mercenary who served as a member of the Vibroblade Brigade during the Clone Wars.\nIn 19 BBY, he was hired by the Corporate Alliance to defend Murkhana City. However, Idis was captured by Ion Team just prior to the Battle of Murkhana while relieving himself in the forest. When interrogated, Idis provided information on how to infiltrate the city and take out the particle shields protecting Murkhana Landing. Like many members of the brigade, he wore clothing similar to that of the Koorivar.",
