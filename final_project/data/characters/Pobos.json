 "content": "Pobos was a male Bothan who worked as an informant for Vedo Anjiliac Atirue.\nAfter Cade Skywalker accepted a job from Vedo to kill Sith scientist Vul Isen, whom he was already hunting, Vedo sent Pobos to meet him on Utapau and to disclose to Skywalker Isen's precise whereabouts. However, he was followed to the rendezvous point by Sith assassins, who shot him, before Skywalker and Wolf Sazen could finish them off, mortally wounding him. In his dying breaths, he begged them to succeed, informing him of Isen's location and that he had sent assassins of his own for Galactic Alliance Remnant Admiral Gar Stazi, who was taking refuge on the planet.",
