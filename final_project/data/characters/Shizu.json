 "content": "Shizu was a male Hutt who built the Hutt Guard Droid RZ-4 prior to his death by 4 ABY. A dozen security chiefs had previously disappointed him, inspiring the Hutt to build RZ-4 as their replacement. The Hutt was ultimately outlived by his droid, who was still active during Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Imperial remnant's blockade of the Anoat sector in 4 ABY.\nShizu was first mentioned in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising released by Kabam, in the description of the obtainable crew member RZ-4. The game was shut down in 2016.",
