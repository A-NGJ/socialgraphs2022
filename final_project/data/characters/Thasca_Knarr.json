 "content": "Thasca Knarr was a Snivvian merchant. He was a sneaky and resourceful individual who ruthlessly pursued the accumulation of credits. Unlike many of his species, he did not have any artistic talents. He secretly desired to take over Exovar's Emporium.\nThasca was an enterprising merchant who set up a semi-permanent shop within one of the Emporium's private rooms. As a Snivvian he was well protected from the freezing temperatures of Neftali\nHe planned to use the shop as a staging ground to take over control of the Emporium so he could use it as a staging ground for piracy, smuggling, bounty hunting and slaving.\nOver time he was able to quietly bring in mercenaries to aid in his attempted coup but he was opposed by Emporium security Redeye and the two assassin droids Entax and Botax.\nThasca's only goal was the constant accumulation of credits. Anything that stood in his way was considered an obstacle to be destroyed.\nThasca Knarr was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.\nHe was designed to be an antagonist to the players who would work for Emporium security to help foil Thasca's attempted coup.",
