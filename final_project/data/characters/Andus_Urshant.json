 "content": "Andus Urshant was a hyperdrive research technician with Shankti Drive Works in the city of D'larah on the planet Demophon during the Galactic Civil War. He was married to Zoam Urshant, and was the father of Aklan Urshant and Fianna Urshant. Due to his position he was to be evacuated by Shankti Drive Works from Demophon before that planet was destroyed in a supernova, with the rest of his family to be evacuated later. Due to his wife's pregnancy, and her entanglement with the G'uotr Network, he decided to hire a starship to evacuate his family and himself earlier.",
