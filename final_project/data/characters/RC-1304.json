 "content": "RC-1304, also known by the nickname O-Four, was a male Human clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He was created by the Kaminoan cloners on the planet Kamino for use in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. Trained as a clone commando, he was made a member of RC-1309's squad, serving alongside fellow commandos DD and Sev under sergeant Niner. The squad was deployed to the planet Geonosis during the first battle of the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the fight O-Four, DD and Sev were all killed, leaving Niner as the only member of Lambda. The sergeant later wished he had sent O-Four west with an E-Web heavy repeating blaster during the battle. Like all clone troopers, O-Four was 1.83 meters tall.\nO-Four was first mentioned in Republic Commando: Hard Contact a 2004 novel written by Karen Traviss. He later received mention in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, another book in the same series.",
