 "content": "Bola Yomm was a female Human from Roon who was the wife of Nilz Yomm. Together they had one child, Auren Yomm. When Auren won the Roon Colonial Games, Governor Koong, the Governor of the Tawntoom province and a losing competitor in the games, poisoned Umboo, the province the Yomm family lived in, with a germ called rooze. Bola was infected but Nilz and Auren were spared. In addition, Koong accidentally poisoned himself. Nilz was able to save his wife by making a cure, but Koong was not so lucky and died.\nBola Yomm was voiced by Pam Hyatt.",
