 "content": "A male Quesoth was a member of the Circling caste, which advised the Queen of the Red, ruler of the planet Quethold, from where he originated. In 8 ABY, he intercepted the Queen's bowlcarrier, Trevik, who carried a bowl of nectar for her, on the member of the Midli caste's way home.\nThe Circling brought the bowlcarrier to a nearby Midli residence, and along with Trevik's brother Jirvin, tasked the bowlcarrier with using a holocam to record several paintings inside the Dwelling of Guests building brought there by alien warlord Nuso Esva. The pair convinced the bowlcarrier to do so by telling him that if Grand Admiral Thrawn—who was going to receive the recordings—was able to determine by studying the art if the Quesoth monarch was Esva's ally, instead of a tool, they would not take action against her. Trevik then left and did as asked. The Circling spoke Quesoth Common Speak.\nThe Circling appeared in the 2011 novella Crisis of Faith, written by Timothy Zahn and included in Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition.",
