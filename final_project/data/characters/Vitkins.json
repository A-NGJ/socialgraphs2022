 "content": "Vitkins was a Human male corporal who served as a Pop-Dog  on Vandor-3 by 44 ABY. He and his partner, Sergeant Dobi, were called in to a small dwelling to investigate reports of domestic disturbance. The two Pop-Dogs then found themselves caught in a trap set up by the Quad-Linked Militant Pacifists, a fictitious terrorist organization that served as a front for Wraith Squadron, and Vitkins and Dobi were then tied up. They were later discovered and freed by some of their fellow soldiers who followed up on their investigation.",
