 "content": "Darth Nostrem was a male Sith Lord of Human or Sith pureblood descent of the resurgent Empire who lived several decades before the Dark Jedi Exar Kun initiated the conflict known as the Great Sith War. During Nostrem's lifetime, Darths Qalar and Victun, two members of the ruling Dark Council, were embroiled in a particularly violent Kaggathâ€”a Sith tradition that pitted two rivals against each other in battle.\nThe duel destroyed the Imperial Citadel on the Empire's capital planet of Dromund Kaas, and Nostrem was tasked with rebuilding the Citadel by the Council. Nostrem was ordered to utilize the resources of Qalar and Victun, who had been killed by the rest of the Council, to rebuild the Citadel according to the designs of the Sith Emperor. After the structure was completed, the Emperor locked Nostrem in the depths of Citadel to test its labyrinthine defenses, and the Sith eventually died after he failed to escape.\nDarth Nostrem was first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, a 2012 reference guide for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
