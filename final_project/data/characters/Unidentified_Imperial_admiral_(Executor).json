 "content": "A male admiral served aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor during the warship's maiden voyage. He served aboard the Super Star Destroyer's bridge during a Rebel power gem attack on the Executor in the Feswe Corridor.\nThis character bears a striking resemblance to Admiral Kendal Ozzel of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Indeed, the Classic Star Wars run may have intended this character to be Ozzel, although the comic does not address him by anything more specific than \"Admiral.\" However, the 2007 novel Allegiance has established that Ozzel does not receive his assignment to the Executor until after the Classic Star Wars comic strip Doom Mission in the Star Wars timeline, and no further connection beside visual similarity links these two characters in any way.\nThis character serves as an admiral aboard the Executor concurrently alongside another admiral during the Super Star Destroyer's maiden voyage, although the admiral referenced in this article only appears fleetingly, while the other admiral acts as the primary commander of the Executor.",
