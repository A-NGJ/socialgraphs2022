 "content": "Jolda was a male Human who was a sergeant in the Imperial Army of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War and Galactic War against the Galactic Republic, when he was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock.\nSergeant Jolda appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as the Voss Equipment Commendations vendor on Vaiken Spacedock, though he was later relabeled as the Level 45 Equipment Vendor. Another vendor in the area is also named Sergeant Jolda, though she is female; both were later removed from the game along with the rest of the planetary Equipment Commendations vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015.",
