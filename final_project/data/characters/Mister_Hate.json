 "content": "Mister Hate was a Human male who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was the brother to a man known as Doctor Schill, or Mr. Love. During the Festival of Love sometime following 0 BBY, Dr. Schill asked a spacer to show love to his brother. The spacer located Mister Hate near a cantina in the city of Tyrena on Corellia. Mister Hate lashed out violently, but when the spacer showed him love, he was overwhelmed. No one, not even Mr. Love, had showed him such compassion.\nMister Hate was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
