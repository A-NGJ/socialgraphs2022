 "content": "Korshnak was a male Barabel clan leader on Barab I. Though vigorous in his youth, as indicated by his battle scars, he grew less fearsome and plumper with age. He controlled his clan with his wits, sending his underlings out to deal with enemies. When an underling became powerful enough to challenge him, Korshnak often sent the prospective champion on a dangerous mission to dispose of them.\nAt one point Korshnak came into conflict with a group of outsiders who unearthed carvings that indicated a Jedi presence in Barab I's distant past.",
