 "content": "Chay Praysh was a Drach'nam who controlled the planet Kvabja during the time of the New Republic. Praysh himself did not live on Kvabja, residing instead on the planet Torpris, headquarters of his slaver consortium. He held a great hatred for females, Human females in particular.\nHe gave himself the title of \"First Greatness,\" and his subordinates were therefore known as \"Greatnesses.\" His fortress on Torpris was guarded by creatures known as krizar, as well as his Drach'nam followers. His operations were eventually discovered by Mara Jade who was briefly captured by Praysh but managed to escape with the help of H'sishi. Praysh managed to escape Torpris but was later apprehended when the New Republic and Luke Skywalker came to free his slaves.",
