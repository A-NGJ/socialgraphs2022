 "content": "Darth Zavakon was a male Dark Lord of the Sith of Human or Sith pureblood descent who served as one of the first members of the Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council. As head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, Zavakon was responsible for the establishment of the Imperial Reclamation Service.\nDarth Zavakon was a male Sith Lord of Human or Sith pureblood descent who lived in the final years of the Sith Empire. In 4999 BBY, Zavakon departed the planet Korriban with the rest of the surviving Sith in order to escape the Galactic Republic after the Sith defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, and it was not until 4980 BBY that the Sith exodus came to an end at Dromund Kaas. There, the Sith Emperor established a new Empire, and Zavakon was chosen as one of the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith who formed the Empire's ruling Dark Council. Taking on the recovery and study of ancient knowledge as his area of influence, Zavakon came to realize that the Empire was suffering because of his fellow Sith's unwillingness to share knowledge. As a result, he dispatched a team of archaeologists and military officers to investigate ruins that other Sith had already surveyed. The significant discoveries made by Zavakon's team led the Dark Council to authorize the formation of the Imperial Reclamation Service, a military organization devoted to preserving knowledge.\nDarth Zavakon was introduced in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, in the section on the Imperial Reclamation Service.",
