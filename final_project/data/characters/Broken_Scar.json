 "content": "Broken Scar was an Esh-kha living in the early years of the Galactic Republic. He had a group of followers, one of whom was Hallow Voice, an Esh-kha who held unusually pacifistic views, unlike the rest of his species. Eventually Hallow Voice was captured by the Rakata and imprisoned in stasis on Belsavis for thousands of years until his release around 3641 BBY, after which he still honored the name of Broken Scar.\nBroken Scar is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic by Hallow Voice during the Consular storyline.",
