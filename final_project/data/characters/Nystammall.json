 "content": "Nystammall was a male Vuvrian Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nBrought to the Coruscant Jedi Temple after being identified as Force-sensitive, Nystammall entered into the Temple academy and began learning the ways of the Force. After graduating, he was selected by the Eirrauc Jedi Master Puroth to study as a Padawan. Traveling the galaxy together, Nystammall constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber for his personal use for the rest of his career. Master Puroth trained the young Vuvrian for years before recommending him to the Jedi High Council as ready to take his Trials of Knighthood. Passing the Trials presented to him, Nystammall was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the High Council.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Nystammall and his former Master reported to Coruscant and took up the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic to combat the Separatist horde. Fighting valiantly throughout the war and earning the rank of Master, the Jedi pair were stationed at Tovarskl when the world was attacked by Confederacy General, the cyborg Grievous. The former Master-Padawan duo fought bravely against the General, but both were slain. Grievous took possession of Nystammall's lightsaber, carrying it as a trophy for the rest of the war. At the end of the war, Grievous wielded Nystammall and Puroth's weapons against Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Utapau. While Kenobi was able to kill the Kaleesh cyborg, the weapons were never recovered.",
