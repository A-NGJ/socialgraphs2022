 "content": "Selene was Human female who convinced her friend, Dustil Onasi, to join her as a Sith Acolyte at the Sith Academy on Korriban. Regarded by Headmaster/Legends Uthar Wynn as an obstacle to Onasi's progress, she was killed on Wynn's orders.\nSelene was Force-sensitive Human female who lived during the Jedi Civil War. At some point after the planet Telos IV was bombed by the Sith Empire, Selene convinced her friend Dustil Onasi, the son of Carth Onasi and a survivor of the bombing, to go with her to the Sith Academy on Korriban. The pair trained there as Sith Acolytes.\nHeadmaster Uthar Wynn observed that Selene did not have the same talent in the Force as Onasi. Believing that Onasi's progress was held back by his affection for Selene, Wynn gave orders for Selene to be removed from the Academy and killed, then he told Onasi that she had died on a mission in the Valley of the Dark Lords. He believed the apprentice would soon forget Selene and maintained records regarding her death in his datapad.\nCarth Onasi arrived on Korriban with Revan, the former Dark Lord of the Sith, and discovered that his son had survived the bombing of their homeworld. Dustil initially refused to join his father and did not believe that the Sith were as evil as his father claimed. After Carth and Revan provided Wynn's datapad as evidence that the Sith had killed Selene, Dustil agreed that he would leave the Academy after he warned other students.",
