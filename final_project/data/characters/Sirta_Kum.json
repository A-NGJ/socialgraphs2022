 "content": "Sirta Kum was a Ho'Din, a reptilian sentient species distinguished by tresses of vibrantly-colored head tendrils. Kum trained as a pharmacologist, and spent two years living with an Araquian tribe on the planet Kirtania.Working with Dr. T'Jaleq Kith'Araquia, Kum discovered that, when boiled, the fluid from inside Shiarha Roots could cure the Direllian Plague, a deadly respiratory disease. Kum was a noted pharmacologist during the years of the Galactic Empire, sharing credit for discovering the cure for the Direllian Plague with Dr. Kith'Araquia. The scientist established a positive reputation for the Ho'Din species among Kith'Araquia's tribe, such that some years later when Araquians from that tribe encountered Kutu, another Ho'Din, they did not attack her; however, the Ho'Din's companions were not so well treated.\nNicky Rea created Sirta Kum for the roleplaying adventure \"The Quality of Mercy,\" published by West End Games in February 1994 as part of Star Wars Adventure Journal 1. Kum's gender was not established in the adventure.",
