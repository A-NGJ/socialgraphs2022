 "content": "Anyar was a male Anguilla who was the tribal leader of a group of Anguilla that lived on the planet Alluuvia during the Galactic Civil War. At some point during the conflict, a group of Rebel Alliance agents traveled to Alluuvia and encountered Anyar and the Anguilla. In order for the Rebels to prove to him that their intentions were honorable, Anyar led the agents to a submerged cave and requested that they engage in the Rites of Conch-tar, a sacred Anguilla ceremony. The Rebels completed the ritual and later, Anyar offered to provide hundreds of Anguilla warriors to assist the agents during an attack on a base that the Galactic Empire had established on Alluuvia.",
