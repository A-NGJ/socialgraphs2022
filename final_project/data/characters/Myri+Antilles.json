 "content": "Myri Antilles, a Human female, was the second daughter of Wedge Antilles and Iella Wessiri Antilles.\nAn intelligent and stubborn girl, she was named for her father's childhood friend Mirax Terrik Horn, whose nickname as a child was Myra. In 27 ABY, after the Battle of Coruscant, she and her older sister Syal were sent to The Maw for safety along with mainly Jedi children for the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nIn 40 ABY, Myri was living with her family on Coronet, Corellia. She inherited Iella's inquisitive nature and affinity for intelligence activities, and, as of the Second Galactic Civil War, was being groomed by her mother to follow in her footsteps as an intelligence agent.\nAfter her graduation she was approached by both the Galactic Alliance and Five Worlds, she subsequently refused both offers deciding to do as her father had, and just stay out of the whole war, something that didn't happen as they were forced to blast their way off of Corellia when they noticed Han and Leia Solo and Lando Calrissian being chased after by the Corellian Defense Force. They escaped to the Errant Venture where Myri worked for tips as a card dealer in one of the Venture's casinos with her mother to gather information. The sheer amount of money that she was making caused her to rethink about joining the intelligence business albeit halfheartedly. She also correctly deduced that whoever was behind the conflict was secretly trying to split the Solo-Skywalker \"alliance.\"\nMyri continued to gather intelligence during the course of the war while on board the Errant Venture getting rich gambling in the process.\nIn 44 ABY, Myri was recruited to the reformed Wraith Squadron to expose and capture General Stavin Thaal as a member of the Lecersen Conspiracy. She contributed by disguising herself as a protocol droid, enabling her to get close to Thaal so she could swipe his blaster before he could kill his ex-wife Zehrinne and Colonel Kadana Sorrel when he, in his new identity as Thadley Biolan, was exposed as an \"impostor\".\nHer role as a member of Wraith Squadron in Aaron Allston's 2012 novel X-Wing: Mercy Kill was reported by attendees of Dragon Con 2011 stating that the author had confirmed it.\nIn Mercy Kill she is described as having natural black hair, despite being first shown with blonde hair in Union.",
