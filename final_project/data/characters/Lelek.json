 "content": "Lelek was a Force-sensitive female Jawa Shaman who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. Reports of her usage of the Force were reached by commander Vilos, stationed at the Mos Ila garrison, who was curious about the usage of the Force in a Jawa. He then sent an Imperial-allied individual to investigate the mysterious occurance. After the individual subdued the Jawa, she was slain.\nLelek only reveals her name if the player chooses the Light Side option of taking her prisoner. The Dark Side option is to kill her there.",
