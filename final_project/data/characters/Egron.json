 "content": "Egron was a male Human who served the Galactic Empire as the Imperial Governor of Chibias during the Galactic Civil War.\nShortly after the Battle of Endor, he came to own a computer core that he believed contained the control codes of a Star Destroyer, and planned to sell those codes to the Rebel Alliance. He employed Markko to slice the computer core, but Markko was unable to finish the job by himself. When he contracted Ghent to do it, Markko was unprepared for the unexpected arrival of Mara Jade. At first, Egron managed to evade Mara's attempts to kill himâ€”but, unfortunately for Egron, he underestimated Mara's talents. Mara shot Egron in the chest, killing him instantly.",
