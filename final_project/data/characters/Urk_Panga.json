 "content": "Urk Panga was a Narquois criminal active during the High Republic Era. Keefar Branto, a criminal who was looking to reform, ingratiated himself with Panga to work on a case, attempting to find out what Panga was up to. However, a meeting between the two and another cloaked individual was interrupted by the private detective Sian Holt, who was monitoring Branto as he was supposed to be on probation. As a result, the Tarnab Arathab Fal attacked and killed Panga and Branto, before attempting to kill Holt.",
