 "content": "A human female was the great-grandmother of the handmaiden Dormé. When visiting the parents of Padmé Amidala at their home on Naboo, Dormé was carving inside a greenhouse with Amidala's father Ruwee when he complimented her skills as a carver and suggested that after Amidala was finished with politics, Dormé wouldn't have any trouble finding something to do at the Naberrie house. Dormé thanked Ruwee before explaining that her great-grandmother had taught her how to carve, adding that it was easier for her to do now that she was older and sewing made her joints ache. Dormé then said that she was looking forward to visiting her great-grandmother when she swapped places with fellow handmaiden Cordé a couple of days later.",
