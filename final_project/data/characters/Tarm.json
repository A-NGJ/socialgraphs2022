 "content": "Tarm was a Human male villager residing on the planet Jomark under insane Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth's rule. In 9 ABY, during Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign, Svan, another Human villager, attempted to kill Tarm with a slugthrower and Tarm attempted to defend himself with a knife; however, C'baoth and a Jedi who he was training, Luke Skywalker, arrived after they sensed the \"evil\" in the building the villagers' confrontation was taking place in in and stopped it. Ultimately, C'baoth considered Tarm in the right following his and Svan's motives, and punished Svan with Force lightning and ordered him to pay Tarm the full wages they had set. Tarm had dark skin and a beard.\nTarm first appeared in the 1992 novel Dark Force Rising, the second installment in Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. He was later pictured in Dark Force Rising 3, the third comic issue in Dark Force Rising's comic adaptation, the story was written by Mike Baron and the artwork was penciled by Terry Dodson.",
