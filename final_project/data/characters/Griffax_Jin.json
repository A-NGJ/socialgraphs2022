 "content": "Doctor Griffax Jin was a virologist who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Jin conducted operations as part of the Galactic Empire's science staff in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. There, scientists were secretly conducting dangerous scientific research for the Empire, intending to re-engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus into a bioweapon. Dr. Jin operated in the cryogenics laboratory of the on level 2 of the research center and served as the chief virologist.\nIn 1 ABY, Griffax Jin was present when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility and the virus escaped containment. The virus killed most of the people in the area, turning them into undead creatures. Dr. Jin survived the outbreak but was infected by the virus. A group of spacers later found Griffax Jin in his lab during their search for an original sample if the virus. They interrogated Jin but the scientist was not eager to help them, considering that the virus should be destroyed, along with the research facility. However, Griffax Jin finally turned into a zombie and attacked the spacer who were forced to defend themselves, killing the undead scientist. The spacer eventually found the virus they were looking for in Dr. Jin's lab.\nGriffax Jin appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Griffax Jin was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14,\" a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
