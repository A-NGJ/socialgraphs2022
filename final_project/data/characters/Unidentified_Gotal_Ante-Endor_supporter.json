 "content": "A member of the Gotal species who possessed three horns was a member of the Ante-Endor Association.\nThe Gotal was part of the Ante-Endor Association, found on the planet Mrlsst. The Association was a pro-Imperial organization, which claimed that the Battle of Endor was a piece of Rebel Alliance propaganda and insisted that the Galactic Empire was still operating at full strength. Along with some other members of the organization; including two Humans and a green pachydermoid being, he tried to beat up Tycho Celchu. He later helped with the cleanup of Mrlssi.\nThis unidentified individual was created by Star Wars artists Edvin Biukovic and John Nadeau for X-Wing Rogue Squadron 5 of the Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair series of comics, published in 1996 by Dark Horse Comics.",
