 "content": "Jirany Sha was a female Miraluka, who was a practitioner of the Luka Sene Force tradition. Acaadi once traveled to her homeworld, to study traditions. During the Jedi Civil War, she came to Iridonia, because her master's vision led her to believe that she could aid in defeating Acaadi, as believed that he was using the knowledge gained from her tradition to corrupt others. She agreed to help a group of Jedi and spacers in defeating him.",
