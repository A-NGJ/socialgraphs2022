 "content": "Boom Boom was a male Gungan constable in Lamaredd. As of 29 BBY, he was a Security Chief's Seconds at Bartyn's Landing, and one of the few Seconds in whom the Security Chief Mix Liddell completely trusted. Liddell assigned Boom Boom and other Seconds to investigate a coastal area where Menahuun had been seen. The Seconds went there riding swoops. They were attacked by laser-armed Menahuun scouts and, in the first seconds of the fight, Boom Boom was blasted from his seat.",
