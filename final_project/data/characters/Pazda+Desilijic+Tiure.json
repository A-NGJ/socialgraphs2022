 "content": "Pazda Desilijic Tiure was a member of the Desilijic kajidic and an uncle of Jabba.\nPazda was distinguished by a prominent beard. As an uncle of Jabba, he was a brother of Zorba , Jiliac and Ziro.\nAt the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Pazda appeared to be a leader of Desilijic, as he was allowed at the court of Borga the Hutt. Pazda was concerned at Borga's willingness to ally with the Yuuzhan Vong, feeling that it would bring doom to Nal Hutta and the Hutts. He voiced his outrage at the deal, but seemed to be overruled by Borga since the Besadii kajidic was the most powerful among the Hutts at the time.\nSure enough, the Yuuzhan Vong proved to be better liars than Borga, launching an attack on Fondor, even though it was one of the Hutts' premier spice markets.",
