 "content": "Deran Nalual was a female Togruta Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final years of the Republic Classic era. A Commander within the Grand Army of the Republic, she survived the war and the execution of Contingency Order 66, along with her master, Jedi Knight Siadem Forte, though she was blinded during their escape.\nDeran Nalual, a Togruta female, was Jedi Knight Siadem Forte's Jedi apprentice during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 19 BBY, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor issued Contingency Order 66, which branded the Jedi as enemies of the Republic. When her clone troopers turned their blasters on the Jedi pair, Forte and Nalual fought and killed their troops before issuing a distress call from Dellalt. Blind from the attack by her troops, Nalual felt some comfort when eight other Jedi arrived on planet. Forte led the fugitive Jedi in hijacking an SX troop shuttle from the newly formed Galactic Empire, making their way offworld. While they were pursued by a group of ARC-170s and a light cruiser, losing four of their company, Nalual and the others escaped pursuit and were given sanctuary by the crew of the Drunk Dancer. In the company of smuggler Jula Shryne, the group was eventually joined by Master Roan Shryne and Padawan Olee Starstone. Given knew hope by Starstone's enthusiasm and determination, Nalual and her companions agreed to search for Grand Master Yoda on Kashyyyk.\nOnce there, Kashyyyk came under invasion by the Empire for housing Jedi. Led by Darth Vader, the Empire searched for the Jedi fugitives, eventually confronting them. Padawan Nalual remained on watch at the landing pad in Kachirho, while her master and the others went into the city to discuss strategy with the Wookiee chieftains. While her master died in a confrontation with Vader, Nalual dutifully waited for her companions before they took off and fled into space. With her friends support, Nalual decided to work on construction sites, or in an agricultural projects within the Empire, and intended to undo the Sith in more subtle ways than with a lightsaber.",
