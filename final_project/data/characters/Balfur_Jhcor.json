 "content": "Balfur Jhcor was a male Trandoshan bounty hunter who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Balfur Jhcor was associated with Bossk, a fellow Trandoshan bounty hunter. In 1 ABY, Balfur and Bossk identified three notable bounties on the planet Lok: Joti Laike, Sardeya Elgrin and Oono Mor'in. Balfur tracked them and localized them while Bossk was stuck on Corellia, tracking the Bofa Treat Gang. Bossk encountered a skilled spacer on Corellia who accepted to help Balfur collect the bounties. The spacer traveled to Lok and met Balfur Jhcor near Nym's Stronghold. The spacer then tracked the three bounties and successfully eliminated all of them. In the meantime, Bossk convinced Balfur to murder the spacer in order not to share the bounties. When the spacer returned to Balfur, the bounty hunter attacked the adventurer but the latter managed to defeat the Trandoshan. Balfur apologized for letting Bossk manipulated him and decided to resign for being a bounty hunter. The Trandoshan also gave all his wapons to the spacer.\nBalfur Jhcor was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Balfur Jhcor was added to the game with the \"Game Update 10\", released on June 2, 2009.",
