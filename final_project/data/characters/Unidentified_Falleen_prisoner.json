 "content": "A Falleen male was captured by a group of Zygerrian slave traders in 19 BBY. He, along with a human and a female Falleen child were kept by the slavers in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell City on the planet of Ord Mantell, overseen by the Zygerrian leader, Raney.\nIn 19 BBY, a renegade clone squad took a bounty job to retrieve a child named Muchi from the slaver's base, and upon arriving at the ruins, assumed the target to be the Falleen girl as she was the only visible child. The clones successfully distracted the Zygerrians by releasing a caged rancor, allowing them to free the Falleen prisoners. However, when one squad member, Omega, addressed the girl as Muchi, the Falleen prisoner communicated that it was not her who was Muchi, but the rancor. Regardless, the clones freed and safely escorted the Falleen to a pair of speeder bikes at the south entrance of the city. There, the Falleen escaped the city with the child and thanks his rescuers.\nThe Falleen prisoner appeared in \"Rampage,\" the fifth episode of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on May 28, 2021. He was portrayed by Liam O'Brien.",
