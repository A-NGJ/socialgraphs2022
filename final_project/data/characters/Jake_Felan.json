 "content": "Jake Felan was a male Human smuggler who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Jake Felan was working from Tansarii Point Station, in the Bright Jewel system. In 1 ABY, Jake Felan needed to move a crate of sliced weapons off Station Gamma, another space station in the Bright Jewel system. In the meantime, a spacer arrived on Tansarii Point Station along with Han Solo and Chewbacca. The spacer was in fact a young smuggler under training and Solo advised the spacer to work for Felan, an old contact of him. The spacer met Jake Felan in the cantina of Tansarii Point Station and accepted to take a job from him. The spacer therefore took a shuttle to Station Gamma and brought a case of sliced weapons back to Tansarii Point Station. However, while arriving at the drop off point, on the bottom level of the station, the spacer encountered Stormtrooper TK-363. Instead of just shooting him, the spacer lured the soldier and managed to convince him to let him access to the Storage room 02. The spacer dumped the weapons as planned and finally returned to Jake Felan. Felan paid the spacer 500 credit for the successful work.\nJake Felan appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jake Felan was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial\", introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
