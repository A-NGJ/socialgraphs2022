 "content": "The father of Jhaka Bakarn was a Human male native to the planet Corellia several generations before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. A member of the prestigious Bakvalen family, the Bakvalen patriarch was furious when his eldest daughter Jhaka turned her back on her life as a Corellian noble and joined the Republic Navy as a starfighter pilot. Her father disowned her, leading Jhaka to change her surname to the more common \"Bakarn,\" and the man's daughter went on to become a renowned fighter ace. When Jhaka was killed in battle against a dangerous warlord, her father was overcome with pride and grief, and he changed the family's name to Bakarn in her honor.\nJhaka Bakarn's father was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Bakvalen family in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011.",
