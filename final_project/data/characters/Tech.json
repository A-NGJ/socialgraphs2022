 "content": "\"Tech\" was the nickname of a clone commando who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars as a member of Clone Force 99. Due to his genetic mutations, he appeared leaner, fairer, and younger than his fellow clone troopers.\nTech served as the brains of his squad and was a valued asset in this regard, using his high intellect and mastery of technology to ensure their operations were successful. Even so, he was no less skilled in combat than the other three members.\nTech was part of Clone Force 99, an elite squad of clone commandos with genetically engineered enhanced abilities. While each of his squad-mates, Hunter, Wrecker, and Crosshair, had their own unique abilities, Tech had an aptitude for science and had incredible skills with technology, including engineering, decryption, and language translation. His appearance differed from that of normal clones of Jango Fett in that he appeared younger, leaner, and lighter-skinned than his genetic template.\nLate in the war, Clone Force 99 traveled in their shuttle, the Marauder, to Anaxes, where the Republic was engaged in a key campaign that they were on the losing side of. At the behest of Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody,\" Tech and the squad joined Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" Advanced Recon Commando CT-5597 \"Jesse,\" and clone medic CT-6116 \"Kix\" on a stealth mission to destroy a Separatist Cyber Center. There, Tech and Rex discovered that the Separatists had been so successful in countering their strategies because they were accessing Rex's battle strategy algorithm through clone trooper Echo, who was being held prisoner on Skako Minor. They escaped the Cyber Center as droid reinforcements closed in on them, and eventually, Tech and the squad would welcome Rex and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker aboard the Marauder en route to Skako Minor to rescue Echo.\nTech and the rest of Clone Force 99 were on Kaller when Order 66 was issued. However, his inhibitor chip failed to activate properly, and Tech did not participate in the Great Jedi Purge. Shortly after Order 66, Tech and his fellow clones returned to Kamino, where they learned with the rest of the galaxy that the Galactic Republic was being reformed into the Galactic Empire. After meeting a female enhanced clone named Omega, Tech, and the rest of Clone Force 99, with the exception of CT-9904 \"Crosshair,\" fled Kamino with her against orders, becoming fugitives from the Empire.\nTech made use of a heavily modified suit of Katarn-class Commando Armor with a specialized visor that acted as a computer display. A computer terminal was installed into the forearm portion of his armor, enabling him to access a number of versatile functions, such as trajectory calculation, translation of alien languages, and recording and replaying sound effects. Tech's advanced data analysis skills allowed him to solve technical issues at speeds even faster than some droids.\nPersonality-wise, Tech was very talkative and communicative; one of his major quirks was his eagerness to dispense trivial knowledge about any given subject without hesitation or reason. He did this regardless of whether anyone was listening to him, or whether anyone else cared about what he was saying, as Wrecker pointed out at one point. When confronted with a task which demanded his full concentration, he tended to become oblivious to what was going on in his surroundings, unless it was a matter of life and death. Tech could often miss the intention behind a question someone asked him, such as when Omega asked him what the Clone Wars were like. Like the rest of the Bad Batch, Tech became protective of Omega and acted as a mentor for her.\nHe also made an effort to record all sentient sounds he encountered, which Hunter described as a \"hobby\" of his. On one occasion, this helped the squad, alongside Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, CT-7567 \"Rex,\" and CT-1409 \"Echo\" escape from an enemy base. Tech was also very calm and non-confrontational, and rarely grew angry. When his squad-mates would argue with each other, he would frequently walk away and not participate. Much like Hunter and unlike his other two teammates, Tech was mostly civil and respectful to his fellow clones. However, although he was not quick to anger, he could become slightly annoyed with his squad-mates, specifically Wrecker, due to the latter's recklessness. Tech could also be sarcastic or passive-aggressive at times, specifically when he was irritated. He was usually doing something with his hands, such as building, soldering, or using some kind of machinery. He gestured a lot when talking.\nAble to comprehend and notice things easily, Tech occasionally had a habit of unintentionally keeping important information secret, assuming that his teammates would notice it on their own, such as Omega's true nature, which he described as being \"obvious,\" or the clones being programmed through the inhibitor chips.\nTech's primary weapons were two DC-17 hand blasters, with which he was very proficient, and during a mission in Corellia he carried a DC-15A blaster carbine. He wore modified Katarn-class Commando Armor with a unique helmet. The helmet was equipped with a translation visor that was capable of translating various languages.\nGeorge Lucas had a very specific vision of the Bad Batch, in that he wanted a version of The Dirty Dozen with clones. Dave Filoni sketched their appearances which Brent Friedman and Matt Michnovetz used to imagine the Bad Batch's voices and personalities. Matt and Brent worked with Dave to flesh out the characters and their story.\nTech was to appear in a four episode arc written by Michnovetz which starred the Bad Batch, now including \"Echo,\" alongside Yoda on Kashyyyk. At the \"Untold Clone Wars\" panel at Celebration Anaheim, Dave Filoni talked about the plot of the arc. He revealed that the characters would ride on \"giant ape lizards,\" that were holy to the Wookiees in a religious way. In one scene Tarfful would ask the tree spirits for permission to go into battle against the enemy, which was a Trandoshan and the Separatist Alliance. To get the enemy out of some of their cities they would have to burn some of the trees. The Clones had no problem with it, but it was upsetting to the Wookiees. A part of the arc would be about the Clones and the Wookiees finding a common ground to fight the Separatists. A story reel clip was shown at the panel, which showed the Bad Batch and other Wookiees riding on the \"ape lizards\" and battle against kinraths from the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game.",
