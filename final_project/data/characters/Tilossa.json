 "content": "Tilossa was a Gotal male who ran The Puddle.\nTilossa took over running The Puddle after forcing out the previous owner. He was primarily concerned about defending The Puddle and collecting his fees from the locals. He was relatively well-liked by the residents, due to his fairness. He built his base of operations near the body of water known as The Puddle and conducted all of his business from there.\nTilossa was known to be fair and just, often acting as a mediator over disputes that took place in The Puddle. He didn't particularly care about what the residents did, as long as behaved themselves and paid their dues to him. He was civil towards guests and merchants. The Gotal dressed in fine, brightly colored clothing.\nDue to his Gotal nature, Tilossa was able to detect electromagnetic energy. This helped him detect the emotional state of beings and made him aware of when they were lying.",
