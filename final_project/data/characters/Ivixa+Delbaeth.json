 "content": "Ivixa Delbaeth was a Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the height of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Ivixa Delbaeth was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, ascending to the rank of Jedi Master after years of dedicated study and service. Following the foundations laid by Master Morrit Ch'gally, Master Delbaeth and fellow Master Fin-So-Rowan saw Master Ch'gally's dream of a massive praxeum ship come to fruition. Dubbed the Chu'unthor, the Jedi High Council approved construction of the ship circa 500 BBY.\nBelieving that the Jedi had become too stagnant on Coruscant, Delbaeth and Rowan led the inaugural class of the Chu'unthor across the Republic, educating their students in the ways of the Jedi and the galaxy. While results from the mobile academy were exceptional, the High Council did not seek to build additional ships to replace smaller ships lost in the past. Despite producing evidence that not as many Jedi Initiates were being brought into the Order, Delbaeth and Rowan were unhappy with the Council's decision.",
