 "content": "Tyla Gallamby was Human female scientist who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Tyla Gallamby was working at an Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the remote planet Dathomir. There, the Empire was conducting secret and dangerous scientific research, intending to engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus in order to create super soldiers. In 1 ABY, an accident happened at the Imperial Research Facility and resulted in the virus outbreak. Most of the Imperial staff was killed and became flesh-craving undead creatures. Luckily, Gallamby survived the attack of the creatures and finally managed to escape the area, avoiding containment into the promptly-established Quarantine Zone. The woman later reported the situation to her superiors but Imperial High Command summoned her to the Executor for debriefing. In fact, Darth Vader himself was very concerned by the outbreak and was reluctant to accept that the Rebellion was not involved in the accident. Tyla Gallamby and other people, such as Tk-216 and Illrian Nhagy, were still present near the Quarantine Zone, awaiting evaluation out of the planet, when independent spacers started to arrive on Dathomir to investigate the outbreak.\nTyla Gallamby appeared as a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tyla Gallamby was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13\", released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong\", an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.",
