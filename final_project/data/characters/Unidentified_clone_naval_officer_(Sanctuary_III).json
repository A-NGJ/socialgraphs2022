 "content": "A clone naval officer was stationed on a medical Pelta-class frigate, the Sanctuary III, during the events of the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, this clone along with at least four others were sent from the planet Naboo in Pelta-class frigates to evacuate stabilized wounded clone patients from the Republic's Haven-class medical station, the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center.\nThis operation was time-sensitive due to the imminent arrival of the Separatist warship Malevolence, a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser. Armed with two giant ion pulse cannons capable of wiping out entire fleets, the heavy cruiser—under the command of the Confederate General Grievous—was on its way to destroy the medical station from which the Sanctuary III and its sister ships were evacuating the wounded clones. This clone along with his ship completed his part of the mission and was gone from the facility before the arrival of the Malevolence, which was ultimately destroyed by Republic forces.",
