 "content": "Pia was a Human female with fair skin and dark-colored eyes. She at one point wore hooded yellow robes that resembled the clothing of Naboo royal handmaidens.\nPia was created for the 2010 art book, Star Wars Art: Visions, by painter Anthony J. Ryder, who painted her portrait over a period of six months between November 2008 and May 2009. Even though she was pictured, no back-story was given to her in the book. Ryder used the handmaidens of Queen of Naboo Padm√© Amidala as inspiration for Pia's intended expression of \"quiet reserve, presence, compassion, and attraction.\"",
