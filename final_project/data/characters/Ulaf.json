 "content": "Ulaf, known affectionately as Uli, was a human male prisoner of the Galactic Empire that served time on Narkina 5. He worked in Unit Five-Two-D, at table five. Forty shifts from his release, Ulaf was pronounced brain-dead by Doctor Rhasiv, a Med-Tech within the facility, after the elderly prisoner suffered a fatal stroke caused by his old age and his grueling working conditions. He was then euthanized, dying peacefully. Prior to his death, Ulaf was the longest-serving inmate in the prison.\nUlaf appeared in the eighth episode of the first season of Andor, titled \"Narkina 5,\" which released on October 26, 2022. Ulaf was portrayed by Christopher Fairbank.",
