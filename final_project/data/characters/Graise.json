 "content": "Graise was a male Human Imperial general non-com.\nWhen the Galactic Empire learned of a possible Rebel base on Dantooine, Graise was sent to destroy it. He arrived to find the base abandoned, but was promoted to general for destroying the base nonetheless.\nIn 1 ABY, Graise was put in charge of shipping power generators from the Dantooine base to Corellia, where they were refitted and shipped offplanet. He also oversaw a Corellian warehouse storing captured starship parts. He was captured by a Rebel agent and interrogated about the project.\nGraise appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
