 "content": "Vix was a Rodian male who lived in the city of Iziz on the planet Onderon during the Onderon Civil War in 3951 BBY. He was an avid fan of the local swoop races and visited a local cantina in Iziz to watch them. There, the Rodian talked of nothing but the swoop races. Even after an attack on Meetra Surik in the cantina by Colonel Tobin of the Onderonian military, Vix was unaware that anything had happened and continued watching the races.\nA male Rodian, Vix lived in the city of Iziz on the planet Onderon during the Onderon Civil War in 3951 BBY. He was a frequent patron of a local cantina.\nWhen the former Jedi Knight Meetra Surik visited the cantina during her stay on Onderon, she spoke with Vix. Their conversation consisted of nothing but Vix detailing his love of swoop racing. Eventually Surik gave up and ceased speaking with the Rodian. When Colonel Tobin, an officer of the Onderonian military, and his men interrupted Surik's meeting with the Human Jedi Master Kavar, Vix paid no attention to the commotion going on around him and continued to watch the swoop races.\nVix enjoyed going to the local Iziz cantina and watching the swoop races there. He hoped to one day become a great swoop racer from watching them. Vix's speech patterns were very basic, and he almost never spoke in full sentences or with proper grammar. Vix often referred to himself in third person as well. He had black eyes and green skin.\nVix appears in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, developed by Obsidian Entertainment, as a non-player character with whom the player may interact while visiting Onderon. He offers no quests or useful information, and the player is not required to speak with him at any point of the game.",
