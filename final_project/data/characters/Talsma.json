 "content": "Talsma was a female human captain. At some point between 22 and 19 BBY, when Senator Padm√© Amidala exited a starship in a hangar on the planet Naboo, the captain was present to escort the senator to her residence. However, Amidala intended to attend Tomarian's Annual Festival of Light Gala and rejected Talsma's offer to accompany her to the gala. Instead, the senator requested that her ship's crew be escorted home. The captain complied and sent the C1-series astromech droid C1-1KR with Amidala along the walk to the gala.\nTalsma had dark skin and short purple and black hair. When greeting Amidala, she wore a tan and gold outfit with a blue overcoat and black pants. Paired with the outfit were gray boots and gloves alongside a helmet that Talsma held in her hands.\nTalsma appeared in \"The Incident, Part 1,\" a comic story by Katie Cook with illustrations by Cara McGee and Brittany Peer. The story was published on June 23, 2021 by IDW Publishing in the fifth issue of the comic series Star Wars Adventures.",
