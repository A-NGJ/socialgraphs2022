 "content": "Dyyl was a human male with fair skin who posted a request for help in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu during the war between the First Order and the Resistance. He asked that someone help him locate a star map that would help him get to the planet Bespin as his navigation computer was not functioning properly.\nA traveler visiting Black Spire Outpost agreed to help and so Dyyl directed them to find the downed viper probe droid V0-RK, which he'd heard might be carrying the data he needed. After the traveler successfully retrieved the map and sent it to Dyyl he thanked them and transferred them 150 credits.\nDyyl first appeared in Star Wars: Datapad, an app released as part of the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, a theme park land that opened at Disneyland Park on May 31, 2019.",
