 "content": "J'aahn  was a fair-skinned, male Human member of the Disciples of Ragnos, a cult attempting to revive the long-dead Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. He wore the uniform of his cult, a dark-red jumpsuit with knee high boots and a helmet with attached goggles. In 14 ABY, J'aahn, along with other cultists such as Hokk, attempted to blow up a cargo train in Coronet City, capital of the planet Corellia. The Human Jedi Master Kyle Katarn and his Padawan, the Human Jaden Korr, were in Coronet City to investigate reports of Disciples of Ragnos activity there when they heard a distress call from the cargo train. Korr was dropped onto the train to stop it from exploding. During the skirmish that occurred, J'aahn contacted Hokk and told him to meet him at station Six-C. J'aahn was then encountered by Korr and was likely killed by the Padawan.\nJ'aahn appears in the Raven Software video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, which was first released on September 16, 2003. In the game, the player may decide to either kill or spare him.\nSome dialogue identifies J'aahn as a cultist, a reference to Soldier of Fortune, another game by Raven Software. Both games contain an exchange of dialogue which involves characters with the names John and Hawk, and refers to \"Station 6C.\"  In Jedi Academy, the spelling is changed to \"J'aahn\" and \"Hokk.\"",
