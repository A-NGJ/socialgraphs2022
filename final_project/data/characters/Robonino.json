 "content": "Robonino was a male Patrolian bounty hunter who was active during the Clone Wars, performing several jobs at the expense of the Galactic Republic on Coruscant. He teamed up with Cad Bane, Shahan Alama, and Aurra Sing during the Senate hostage crisis. He was later hired by Count Dooku to harass several Republic senators who were attempting to stop a bill that would escalate the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Robonino made himself a career as a bounty hunter. He was part of a group led by the notorious Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane that took the Senate Building hostage in order to free Ziro the Hutt. While the others made their way through the building to locate hostages, Robonino sabotaged the power distribution network of the Senate Building from the control room. He then triggered the emergency lock-down in the adjacent Senate Office Building, which allowed Bane to execute the rest of his plan. Robonino remained in the control room, and when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker arrived to investigate the outage, the crafty Patrolian was able to get the jump on the skilled Jedi by grabbing him from behind and electrocuting him while Skywalker was occupied by attacks from Robonino's comrades Shahan Alama and Aurra Sing. After the Hutt was freed, Robonino left the crime scene along with the rest of the group.\nLater, Robonino, along with Chata Hyoki, were hired by Count Dooku to intimidate various senators to try to stop a vote on a Senate bill. Dooku later instructed them to assassinate Padm√© Amidala. The next evening, Robonino and Hyoki tracked Amidala down through the streets of Coruscant and attacked. However, Amidala was able to shake them and escape via a speeder. Despite their failure, Robonino and Hyoki nonetheless moved on their next target, attacking Senator Bail Organa in the Senate Building Hangar one morning and gravely injuring him. However, Robonino and his partner were arrested by police forces.\nRobonino was bounty hunter with a variety of skills, able to infiltrate the Senate building, sabotage the power grid, drive a speeder, and use the element of surprise to take down a Jedi. Robonino had an eyepatch covering his left eye.",
