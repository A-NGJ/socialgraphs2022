 "content": "Osted Wermis was an Imperial admiral and the commandant of Anaxes. Following the Battle of Endor and the New Republic's capture of Coruscant, he held the Axum system even as the Republic gained control of the Core Worlds. In 8 ABY, however, his superior, Admiral Feyet Kiez, absconded from the system with the Star Dreadnought Whelm, having been ordered by the Reborn Emperor Palpatine to join his forces assembling at Byss in the Deep Core for a new strike against the New Republic. With the linchpin of his defenses gone, Wermis surrendered Anaxes to the Republic shortly afterwards, admitting to his captors that he was as baffled as New Republic Intelligence as to the Whelm's destination.",
