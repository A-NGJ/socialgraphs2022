 "content": "Rei Reeven was a male Rodian member of the Lok Revenants who lived on Lok during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nRei Reeven was a member of the Reeven Clan, a Rodian clan allied with Nym and his Lok Revenants since before the Clone Wars. After the Battle of Yavin, he was also a member of the Lok Revenants, working as a field agent.\nIn 1 ABY, Reeven got injured and ended up stranded in the middle of the Great Maze of Lok. However, he was rescued by a spacer sent by one of his clanmates, Nym's quartermaster Ralia Reeven. The spacer found his way in the maze successfully and carried medical supplies to Rei Reeven before it was too late.\nRei Reeven was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Rei Reeven was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
