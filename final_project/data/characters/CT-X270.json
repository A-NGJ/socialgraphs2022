 "content": "CT-X270, also known as \"Xutoo,\" was a clone trooper pilot in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Around 22 BBY, Xutoo was chosen alongside three other clone troopers by Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-98 for a mission to the planet Ord Cestus. The clone troopers served as an escort for two Jedi, Kit Fisto and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Vippit barrister Doolb Snoil. As the mission progressed, Kenobi asked Xutoo to deliver Snoil back to the galactic capital of Coruscant. However, their transport was attacked in mid-air by a drone ship secretly dispatched by members of the Five Families, the ruling council of the Cestus Cybernetics corporation. Snoil survived the attack by using an escape pod, but Xutoo's transport ship was destroyed, killing the clone pilot.\nCT-X270, nicknamed \"Xutoo,\" was one of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett bred on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. Xutoo received special training as a clone trooper pilot. Around 22 BBY, Xutoo was included in a squad of four clone troopers handpicked by Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-98 to accompany Jedi Master Kit Fisto, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Vippit Barrister Doolb Snoil to the planet Ord Cestus. The Jedi were dispatched there in an attempt to prevent the local Cestus Cybernetics corporation from selling the deadly JK-13 security droids to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nA military shuttle brought Xutoo, Alpha-98, and troopers CT-36/732, CT-44/444, and CT-12/74 to Centralia Memorial Spaceport on the galactic capital of Coruscant, where they met the Jedi and the Barrister. After the team loaded its cargo onto their transport cruiser, Xutoo took control of the ship and piloted it to Ord Cestus. Xutoo initially landed the ship at a remote and unpopulated section of the Dashta plain, where the group split up. Fisto and all the clone troopers, except for Xutoo, disembarked, intent on assembling and training the local population in order to start an insurgency should Kenobi's and Snoil's attempts at diplomacy fail. Xutoo then set course for the capital city of ChikatLik, assumed a plausible landing trajectory for a ship arriving from Coruscant, and landed the transport at a landing pad, where a delegation had already been awaiting the dignitaries from the Republic. In ChikatLik, Kenobi attempted to establish a secure communications channel with Coruscant by creating a link through Xutoo at their docked ship, but a solar storm disrupted the link.\nWhen the negotiations did not bear fruit, Kenobi and Fisto decided to employ deception to achieve their goals. Fisto masqueraded as a Nautolan mercenary working for the Confederacy and kidnapped members of the Five Families, the ruling body of Cestus Cybernetics and the de facto rulers of the entire planet. Kenobi rescued the corporation's rulers and swayed the Cestians to the Republic's side. However, the Jedi's fraud was exposed, thanks to a recording secretly taken by the Confederate Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress. Kenobi and Snoil were then banished from Cestus and had to return to Coruscant empty-handed. Kenobi and Snoil returned to Xutoo's ship, and the clone pilot took off. However, Kenobi decided to continue his work on the planet, asking Xutoo to deliver Snoil safely to Coruscant, and used an escape pod to covertly reach Fisto's position. As soon as Kenobi left the ship, Xutoo noticed a drone ship approaching their transport. The ship had been dispatched by the Five Families, who attempted to prevent the Jedi from reaching Coruscant, since the latter had uncovered vital information that could end their rule of Cestus.\nThe drone ship fired a number of probe droids that homed in on Xutoo's transport and started attacking it. Desperately trying to evade fire, Xutoo notified Snoil of the attack and advised him to evacuate the ship on one of the remaining escape pods. Stunned by the attack, Snoil initially decided to stay aboard, but, when Xutoo told him that he would jettison the remaining pods in an attempt to distract the attacking probe droids, Snoil changed his mind, quickly boarded one of the pods, and escaped. Xutoo jettisoned the pods as he had said and performed a series of evasive maneuvers trying to evade enemy fire, but the ship was soon destroyed and Xutoo was killed. Snoil managed to safely reach the ground and was picked up by the Jedi's forces. The Barrister was later killed in the course of the fight, but the overall mission was a success.\nLike all clone troopers, Xutoo stood 1.83 meters tall. Raised to be a clone trooper pilot, Xutoo handled the controls of the Jedi transport with great confidence and skill. When confronted by the attacking ship, Xutoo tried to keep his calm, although there was a hint of panic in his voice as he addressed Snoil. Xutoo was determined to protect the Barrister's life and urged him to leave the ship. The clone pilot tried his best to evade the attack, using the escape pods to distract the attacking droids and successfully pulling a series of elaborate evasive maneuvers. However, these tactics could not save Xutoo's life.\nXutoo's only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity was in The Cestus Deception, a 2004 novel written by Steven Barnes.",
