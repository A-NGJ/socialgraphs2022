 "content": "Jamie Turhaya was a Human male who was the owner of Turhaya's Landspeeder Repair Shop, and the sibling of Matt Turhaya.\nWhen Matt Turhaya bet Turhaya's Landspeeder Repair to Tere Metallo in a sabacc game and lost, it seemed as if his betting had ruined Jamie's company. However, since Matt was not a full partner in the company, Metallo refused to take the company as payment, instead forcing Matt to work off his debt aboard her starship, the Star Quest. This allowed Jamie Turhaya to keep ownership of the company.",
