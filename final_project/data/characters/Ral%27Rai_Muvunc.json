 "content": "Ral'Rai Muvunc was a Twi'lek male serving the Alliance to Restore the Republic as the head of Ordnance and Supply  during the Galactic Civil War.\nAs head of OaS, Muvunc ranked as one of the seven Supreme Commanders in the military High Command, but he seems also to have served as Minister of Supply in the civilian government.\nAmong his other duties, Muvunc was one of the handful of senior personnel with authority to hire privateers to serve the Rebel cause, and in contrast to Admiral Ackbar of Fleet Command, he was an enthusiastic supporter of this policy. Muvunc issued letters of marque and reprisal to many Rebel privateers, including Chaeloe Dantin.\nFollowing the formation of the New Republic, Mon Mothma tasked Muvunc with aiding industrial planets that the Galactic Empire had withdrawn from in the wake of the Battle of Endor. These planets were often isolated and left in ecological tatters by the Empire, with no native food supply, so Muvunc began sending negotiating teams to free agricultural worlds to make arrangements to supply these famine-stricken worlds with food. One such team was sent in 2 ABY to Kaal in the Yushan sector.\nRal'Rai Muvunc later became Minister of Commerce of the New Republic. In 8 ABY, he negotiated the surrender of Kuat and its shipyards to the New Republic during the Taking of Kuat.\nThe Kaal Connection erroneously identifies this character as a Sullustan, and gives his name as \"Ral-Rai Muvunc.\"",
