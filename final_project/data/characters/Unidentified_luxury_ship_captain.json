 "content": "A human male served as the captain of a luxury liner during the High Republic Era. He wore a satin-and-fur cloak and sported a goatee. When his starship was one of a dozen stranded at the Amaxine space station in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the captain refused to share any food with the others stranded at the station, claiming that he could not think of depriving the passengers of his ship of the deluxe meals they had ordered from the liner's chefs. After being told off by Jedi Padawan Reath Silas and the young woman Nan, as well as Leox Gyasi pointing out that there were a lot worse places to have been stranded than the plant-filled space station, given the circumstances, the captain came around and agreed that his ship did have supplies to share.",
