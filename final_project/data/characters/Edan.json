 "content": "Edan was a moff on the Imperial Remnant's Moff Council in 19 ABY. He was a skeptic of a proposed truce between the Remnant and the New Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 19 ABY, he took part in the conference where Admiral Gilad Pellaeon was planning to open peace negotiations to the New Republic. Edan was very concerned about whether the New Republic would stick to such contract or give many prejudices that are spread over the Imperial Remnant. After Pellaeon managed to convince him, Edan agreed to his proposal at the end of the conference and made peace with the New Republic which ended the Galactic Civil War.",
