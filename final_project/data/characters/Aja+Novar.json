 "content": "Aja Novar was a female Human criminal who was a henchman of a local crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Novar carried a large blaster cannon in battle, and her lieutenants were known as \"Face Butchers.\"\nAja Novar appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Novar can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon C-73, which appears on the planets Nal Hutta, Ord Mantell, Nar Shaddaa, Alderaan, and Voss. The player has the option to kill her or capture her alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord she worked for, where she was encountered, and her fate.",
