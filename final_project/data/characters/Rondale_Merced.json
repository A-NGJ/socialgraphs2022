 "content": "Rondale Merced was a Socorran member of the Black Bha'lir. Alongside Vance Caelli, he founded the Caelli-Merced Syndicate and prospered as the only weapons manufacturer operating on Socorro. When Alderaan was destroyed, Merced and Caelli's nephew, Pret Swain was visiting them. With Swain's home gone, his uncles offered him a position to help run Caelli-Merced. Around a year after Alderaan's destruction, both Merced and Caelli disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\nRondale Merced is referred to as \"Lee Merced\" once in Chapter Two of The Black Sands of Socorro. As he is referred to as \"Rondale Merced\" several times in Chapter Seven, this article presumes that Rondale Merced is the character's correct name.",
