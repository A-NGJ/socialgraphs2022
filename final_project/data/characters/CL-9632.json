 "content": "CL-9632, nicknamed \"Trap,\" was a clone trooper lieutenant who led Tango Company during the Clone Wars. He served aboard a Republic supply ship being transported back to Republic space by Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee.\nAfter serving on Geonosis, several clone troopers of Tango Company were infected by brain worms. They were then sent on a mission to Ord Cestus on a medical supply run. But while stationed on the Pelta-class frigate, TB-73, the Clone Trooper Scythe began infecting the other clones and began to take over the ship. After Scythe ordered the Clone Troopers Edge and Ox to attack the Jedi Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee. Trap and another clone, Havoc, heard blaster shots in the mess and they rushed in to find the Padawans. The Jedi believed the clones were also infected and ordered them to stand down. But they demonstrated that they were not infected, and Trap volunteered Havoc to watch after the two unconscious Clone Troopers, while Trap and the Jedi head to the bridge. After initially trusting him it would soon be revealed to the Jedi, that he too was infected by a brain worm. Trap attempted to kill his Jedi comrade Barriss Offee, but he was killed by Offee who ignited her lightsaber through his stomach. If not for his attack the Jedi would not have known about the parasites.\nTrap carried a DC-15S carbine, he as well was featured wearing a back pack. He wore Phase I Armor that had blue markings and bore a striped sigil on his chest plate that resembled a stylized tiger face.",
