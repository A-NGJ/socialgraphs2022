 "content": "Hosh Hune was a grim, bald Human male from the planet Fondor who served in the Battle of Hoth as a rear gunner for the Rebel Alliance's Rogue Group. Hune came from a low-caste family and originally worked as an apprentice in the Fondor Guild of Starshipwrights, but he joined the Alliance after discovering that he was working on weapons systems for the Galactic Empire's massive warship, the Executor. When the Empire attacked the Rebels' Echo Base on Hoth in 3 ABY, Hune and pilot Tarrin Datch flew as Rogue Ten in the makeshift Rogue Group of T-47 airspeeders, but their vehicle was shot down in the battle, killing Hune.\nHosh Hune was a male Human from the planet Fondor who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Coming from a low-caste Fondorian family, he was given an apprenticeship in the Fondor Guild of Starshipwrights due to his family's years of service to the guild. Hune was put to work on weapons systems, but when he realized that they were for the Galactic Empire's massive Executor warship, he deserted his post and joined the Rebel Alliance, the Empire's opponent in the war. In the year 3 ABY, Hune was stationed at the Alliance's Echo Base on the icy world of Hoth. He was part of the base's starfighter complement, which was composed of Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron, and Green Squadron.\nWhen an Imperial probe droid discovered the base, the Alliance's General Rieekan ordered an evacuation. The Imperial Navy arrived in the Hoth system, and various members of the Rebel starfighter complement were pressed into service as the makeshift Rogue Group, flying T-47 airspeeders that had been adapted to cold weather use. Hune served as the rear gunner for pilot Tarrin Datch; together, the two were Rogue Ten of twelve. While Alliance personnel evacuated the planet in GR-75 medium transports, Commander Luke Skywalker led Rogue Group into the Battle of Hoth, hoping to delay the Imperial AT-AT walkers of Blizzard Force that were trying to destroy Echo Base's deflector shield generator. Datch and Hune made a strafing run at Blizzard 1, the enemy force's lead walker, but caused little damage to its armor. Their airspeeder was later shot down during the battle, and although Datch survived and the vehicle was salvaged, Hune was killed. However, the Rebels' evacuation was ultimately a success.\nHosh Hune was a grim, bald man from a family of low status. When he discovered that he was working on weapons systems for the Executor, he agonized over wasting the efforts of his family, and then joined the Rebel Alliance.\nHosh Hune was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, a 2012 reference book written by Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart. He was established as being a member of Rogue Group, an airspeeder squadron that was first seen in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. However, a card titled \"Snowspeeder Rogue Ten\" that was released in the Star Wars Trading Card Game's 2003 \"The Empire Strikes Back\" expansion revealed that one of the airspeeders seen attacking General Veers's AT-AT in the film is Rogue Ten. The film can thus technically be said to be an indirect appearance of Hune.",
