 "content": "Anii Degarienne was a Human female.\nAnii Degarienne was a female Human and the wife of Matt Turhaya, son of the Corellian Clone Wars hero Arada Turhaya. Degarienne encouraged Turhaya to follow his dreams of serving in the Imperial Navy; Turhaya attended the Imperial Naval Academy and graduated at the top of his class. A few weeks after his graduation, Degarienne was killed in a freak accident at the weapons manufacturing plant she worked at. Turhaya took their daughter, Alexandra, to live with relatives on Janara III while he served the Galactic Empire. Turhaya quickly became disillusioned with the Empire, and despised its methods and actions, eventually deserting from the service. He made his way to Janara III a year later, only to find that the planet had been raided by Imperial forces commanded by High Inquisitor Adalric Cessius Brandl. Turhaya found no survivors of the raid, and believed Alexandra killed. She had survived, however, and was taken to the planet Garos IV, where she was fostered with the planet's Imperial governor, Tork Winger and his wife, Sali. Alexandra held some memories of her mother, although she believed her name was \"Ana.\"",
