 "content": "Trea Kobbeth was a female Twi'lek Pilgrim who lived on Tython illegally during the Cold War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.\nA Twi'lek female, Trea Kobbeth and her son, Viyo, were among the many Pilgrims who followed Matriarch Kolovish to the planet Tython in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War and the enslavement of Ryloth by the Hutt Cartels. Assisting in the establishment of Kalikori village, Kobbeth was grieved to discover her son had been abducted by a Flesh Raider in the Tythos Ridge. Approaching a young Padawan visiting the village, Kobbeth begged the apprentice to find her son. Young Viyo returned not long after, unscathed as the Flesh Raider simply wanted him as a translator.\nShe was married to a man by the last name of Kobbeth, a sergeant in the Republic Military. The Twi'lek man encountered an Imperial on Belsavis, who saved him and a member of his squad from an Esh-kha assault in exchange for a vault key.",
