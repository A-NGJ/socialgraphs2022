 "content": "Kippy Martin was a Human female who lived on Naboo during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKippy Martin took up residence on the Mid Rim world of Naboo. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, she worked as a security officer at Stonewall Labs, along with Walker Luskeske, under the orders of the Security Chief Vance Groten. However, she had to quit after falling off a speeder while reaching close to top speed. Kippy was not badly hurt, but she was never the same since the accident. In 1 ABY, Kippy Martin stayed at a camp in the Gallo Mountains near Dee'ja Peak. While there, she was pestered by a swarm of starving flewts. A spacer who was looking for a security beacon from Stonewall Labs accepted to kill the creatures to help her.\nKippy Martin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Kippy Martin was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
