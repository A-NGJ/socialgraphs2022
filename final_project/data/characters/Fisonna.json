 "content": "Fisonna was a male Tarasin. When Fisonna was a child, he was the troublemaker of the Hiironi irstat. Despite his grandmother Cryalira being the Irstat-Kes, her position did not shield him from punishment. His grand schemes were usually directed against Humans in the nearby towns of Gadrin and Hedrett. He also spied around the irstat, and knew everything that was going on.\nFisonna had very good control of his color-changing ability. He always wore rough medallions he had made himself from rocks and branches.",
