 "content": "DS-181-3 was the call sign of a Human male starfighter pilot who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. After receiving training at the Prefsbelt Imperial Academy from Baron Soontir Fel, DS-181-3 flew as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron, part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, and was given the nickname \"Fel's Wrath.\" In 4 ABY, DS-181-3 was present for Sith Lord Darth Vader's arrival aboard the second Death Star, and he later participated in the Battle of Endor.\nThe Human male designated DS-181-3 was a starfighter pilot in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. Studying under renowned pilot Baron Soontir Fel at the Prefsbelt Imperial Academy, DS-181-3 went on to serve as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron—part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group—piloting the TIE/IN interceptor Saber 3. Regularly ordered to remain at a distance from Fel to allow the Baron room to maneuver during combat, DS-181-3 was given the nickname \"Fel's Wrath.\"\nIn 4 ABY, DS-181-3 was present when Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived aboard the second Death Star to discuss the battlestation's lagging construction schedule with the station's commander, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod. The Sith Lord announced that Emperor Palpatine himself would be arriving to personally oversee the remainder of the Death Star's assembly. DS-181-3 later flew on Fel's wing during the Battle of Endor, which ended in an Imperial defeat and the destruction of the second Death Star.\nTrained by the Empire's most successful pilot, Baron Soontir Fel, DS-181-3 earned a place as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron. In combat, DS-181-3 would watch the Baron's back, though he was often ordered to remain at a distance to allow Fel to maneuver. DS-181-3 had black hair and light skin.\nDuring his Imperial service, DS-181-3 wore a black Imperial Navy crewman's uniform.\nDS-181-3 first appeared in the opening scene of 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi as an unnamed background character awaiting the arrival of Darth Vader on the second Death Star. In 2000, he was first identified by name on a card for the Death Star II Limited set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, with the name simultaneously being used as a gameplay statistic for his call sign.\nBecause part of the scene showing Vader's arrival on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi was reused in the Special Edition release of The Empire Strikes Back for a scene showing Vader arriving aboard the Executor from Bespin, the actor who portrayed DS-181-3 can be seen in the Special Edition version of The Empire Strikes Back, alongside other extras who portrayed Imperial officers in Return of the Jedi.",
