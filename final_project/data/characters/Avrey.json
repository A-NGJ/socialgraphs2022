 "content": "Avrey was a female Human communications officer who served onboard the cruiser, Indomitable, during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During a battle on the planet Kothlis, Avrey remained on the cruiser, repairing decade-old technology as General Grievous had jammed all communications on the Indomitable, Pioneer and Coruscant Sky.\nIn 21 BBY, she was present with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano onboard the Indomitable. She was instructed by Admiral Yularen to remain on the ship when the Republic fleet made their way to Kothlis and prepare for their defense against the Separatist fleet under the command of General Grievous. When the fleet came out of hyperspace, Avrey saw that the internal and external communication systems from the fleet were not working and discovered that it was virus which was activated by Grievous. After proposing a solution, she was able to repair the technology, allowing the fleet to successfully win the battle. After the battle ended, she asked Obi-Wan to secure a connection to the Jedi Temple.",
