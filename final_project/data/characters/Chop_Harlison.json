 "content": "Chop Harlison, along with his younger brother, Roy, were orphans who lived on the planet Shesharile 5. After their parents were killed by a swoop gang in their home in Gallisport, Harlison was forced to drop out of school without any funding. Having nearly completed his degree in advanced repulsorlift design, he was able to join the Rabid Mynocks as a mechanic. Once he developed the prototype swoop known as the Star Slinger, his designs became coveted by rival gangs, the Spiders and the Raging Banthas. Marrying Sharda, the couple had a daughter named Jardra. After her daughter's birth, Shadra was killed by the Spiders; Harlison took in a young orphan named Bobi, another victim of the violent gangs of Gallisport.\nChop Harlison was present at docking bay 1831 on Gallisport with Dutan Lee to meet Shamus Falconi and Grasheel. He observed Grasheel give the signal that they were being watched but to stay calm by smoking a cigarillo. He greeted the Wookiee as he disembarked the Lumrunner. After Imperial Customs officer Alijah Orr failed to find any contraband, Harlison took possession of tibanna gas that had been smuggled in lum bottles and military-grade repulsorlift coils.",
