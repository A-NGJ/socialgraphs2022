 "content": "Solum'ke was a female Weequay bounty hunter and the mate of Diergu-Rea Duhnes'rd. At some point, she, along with Duhnes'rd, participated in a treasure hunt on Zelos II while vacationing there. Though the two were eventually outwitted by the Qwohog K'zk and his two Corellian accomplices and left for dead, she was reassured that the three would be no problem for the two best bounty hunters in the sector to track down.\nAs it happened, the two did manage to come away with enough treasure to not only cover their vacation, but also to secure the purchase of a freighter, possibly even a new one.",
