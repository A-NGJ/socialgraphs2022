 "content": "Rolt was a Gotal male who lived on the Colossus, and a regular of Aunt Z's tavern. When the First Order occupied the Colossus, Rolt was initially happy with their presence, but was later arrested and taken away by several stormtroopers for loitering past curfew.\nRolt was a resident of the Colossus, a refueling station on the planet Castilon. He regularly attended the tavern owned by Aunt Z.\nAfter the First Order organized the kidnapping of Torra Doza to get the station's captain, Imanuel Doza, to allow their presence as security on the Colossus, Rolt was welcoming of the occupation. In the marketplace, Rolt walked past a stormtrooper commander with several other stormtroopers, calling out to them. The commander, however, walked away without acknowledging the Gotal, and one of the stormtroopers pushed past him, knocking Rolt aside.\nLater in the day, Rolt was captured by a pair of stormtroopers, who tied his hands behind his back and arrested him, claiming he had been loitering past curfew. Despite his attempts to claim innocence and protest his rights, Rolt was taken away by the stormtroopers, watched from around the corner by Kazuda Xiono and BB-8.\nRolt first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"The First Order Occupation\", voiced by Jason Hightower.",
