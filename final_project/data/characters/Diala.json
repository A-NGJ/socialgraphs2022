 "content": "Diala was a Human female smuggler who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Diala resided in the city of Mos Espa on Tatooine. During this time, an individual named Barak tasked a smuggler with delivering a crate of contraband to Diala. The smuggler succeeded, despite having to dispatch a Mos Espa inspector.\nDiala was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Diala was added to the game along with the smuggling missions introduced with the \"Chapter 3\" update, released on September 27, 2006.\nIn the game, Barak gave quests to players who are in the smuggler profession, by having them deliver contraband to various NPC's. One of these NPCs was Diala.",
