 "content": "MB-223 was the designation of a human male stormtrooper who served the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps. Around five years before the Battle of Yavin he was partnered with TK-626 and charged with patrolling an Imperial airfield on the planet Lothal. During a patrol, MB-223 encountered the Mandalorian Sabine Wren who was planting a paint bomb on a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter in the airfield. He and his partner tried to shoot her, but she managed to evade them and set off the explosives, destroying the TIE fighter and splattering MB-223 and his comrades with purple paint. Several months later, MB-223 and TK-626 were on night patrol duty again when they encountered Sabine. During that incident, Sabine and her rebel comrades stole a transport and destroyed an entire row of parked TIE fighters.\nA male stormtrooper designated MB-223 served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire on the planet Lothal. Around five years prior to the Battle of Yavin, MB-223 and another trooper designated TK-626 were assigned to patrol an Imperial airfield on Lothal filled with newly produced TIE fighters. He and his comrade completed 108 patrols of the field during the day, and by the time of 109th patrol the pair were patrolling in the dark.\nDuring the 109th patrol, TK-626 alerted MB-223 to a \"shushing\" sound coming from some of the TIEs which the pair then investigated. Weapons drawn, they discovered Sabine Wren, a girl in Mandalorian armor, spraying the starbird emblem onto wing of one of the TIEs. MB-223 questioned the girl, and when she didn't stand down the pair began shooting at her; however, Wren was able to dodge the shots and began weaving through the TIEs in the field to escape the troopers. During the chase TK-626 contacted their commander and asked for reinforcements, after which the pair lost Wren, who began taunting them. Reinforcements then arrived and all of the troopers fanned out to find the Mandalorian, before Wren attacked one, drawing them all to her location, which was next to the fighter she had painted her graffiti on. TK-626 then realized that a graffiti-bomb had been placed in the middle of the starbird, which then exploded destroying the TIE fighter. MB-223 and his comrades were knocked to the ground, their armor covered in purple paint.\nFor their failure to apprehend the graffiti artist Sabine, MB-223 and TK-626 were relegated to night patrol duty and were not allowed to rotate aboard a Star Destroyer. Months after his encounter with Sabine, he and TK-626 were again performing their 109th patrol of the airfield when they encountered Sabine while patrolling the wall on north side, sector nine. Having learnt that her rebel leader Kanan Jarrus was being imprisoned above Mustafar, Sabine and her friends decided to steal a transport from the airfield in order to rescue him.\nMB-223 and TK-626 attempted to shoot Sabine but she dodged their blaster bolts. TK-626 alerted the other stormtroopers at the airfield who joined the pursuit. Eventually, Sabine leapt onto the fuselage of a TIE fighter. In the midst of the commotion, Sabine's rebel friends stole a transport which began taking off from the airfield. Sabine escaped on the transport but before leaving triggered a bomb which destroyed an entire row of TIE fighters. MB-223 and TK-626 survived the explosion which also left behind a smoke plume in the shape of the starbird symbol. Thus, MB-223 and TK-626's second attempt to apprehend Sabine ended in ignominy.\nMB-223 wore a full set of stormtrooper armor and carried an E-11 medium blaster rifle.\nMB-223 first appeared in Rise of the Rebels a book written by Michael Kogge and released in 2014 as part of the run-up to the release of the Star Wars Rebels television show. The book contained adaptations of four prelude shorts released for Rebels, including \"Art Attack,\" the short that MB-223 appeared in which was released shortly after Rise of the Rebels. In the adaptation TK-626 grabs MB-223 when alerting him to the noise, but this doesn't occur in the short.",
