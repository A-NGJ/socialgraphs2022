 "content": "Reeshee Irway was an Arkanian brain-gangster who was eventually arrested for sandship licensing violations. The unassuming cause for arrest served Canto Bight Police Department detective Oosha Choi as a weak example of a minor crime bringing down an experienced criminal with cause, as Choi hoped to do the same to the Rodian arms dealer Flestic Crupp.\nReeshee Irway was first mentioned in the 2018 one-shot comic book Star Wars: The Last Jedi – DJ – Most Wanted 1, a tie-in story for the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker.",
