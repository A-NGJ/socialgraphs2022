 "content": "Prard'enc'iflar was an officer in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, and a relative of General Drask. He was tall, with white-streaked hair.\nIn 22 ABY, he was the commander of the Brask Oto Command Station in the Redoubt, and thus conducted the defense of the station against the Vagaari first-strike attack in that year. The defenses of the command station badly damaged the Vagaari carrier, but the defending Chiss starfighters were being overwhelmed by enemy squadrons until the tide was turned by the arrival of Luke and Mara Jade.\nCommander Prard'enc'iflar survived the battle, and was the officer to whom the Jedi Skywalkers subsequently revealed the coordinates of the Vagaari fleet rendezvous.",
