 "content": "Loam Redge was a Chief Imperial Inquisitor of unknown age whose topmost priorities, as befitted an Inquisitor, were to capture Force-sensitives, torture them, and then destroy them; a task at which he was very good. He had rich brown hair and dirt-colored eyes.\nRedge trained Finn Darktrin, who was sent to recover a data holocron from the Jedi ruins on Dantooine. Also in the same year, Redge was stationed in the Emperor's Retreat where he met with an individual who had been sent to him by Kaja Or'Zee after performing several tasks set by her.\nHis first task to the individual was a simple one; he had heard of a male Zabrak noble who was aiding the Rebellion and thought he could escape Imperial notice, and wanted the man captured. Shortly after capturing the man, and returning him to Redge, the individual was tasked with retrieving another Rebel sympathizer who was in hiding on Naboo. Easily completing this task, the individual was then sent to retrieve a datadisk from a known slicer. The individual soon killed the slicer, and returned once more to Redge. It is unknown what information was on this disk, but Redge then sent the individual to capture the leader of the group of Rebels who they had been hunting; the individual captured this lead slicer then returned.\nRedge rewarded the individual with a piece of reinforced stormtrooper armor, then sent them to Lord Hethrir for further tasks.\nLoam Redge appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
