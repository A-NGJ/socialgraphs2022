 "content": "Qakkee was a male Rodian hunter from Rodia.\nHe was known as the best wildlife hunter in the galaxy and his impressive record proved it. However, one day he encountered Sawtooth, a legendary uller who made his residence in the Dead Forest on Kashyyyk. In the ensuing conflict, he was horribly mutilated by the giant creature. Left for dead, he was discovered by the locals and fitted with cybernetic legs and an arm. Defeated and shamed, he no longer hunted after the incident and lived in self-imposed exile at the Bestine cantina on Tatooine. He vowed vengeance on Sawtooth, but could not do it himself so he hired an individual to do it for him.\nIn 1 ABY Qakkee commissioned an unknown spacer to avenge the great hunter by killing Sawtooth, after proving their self by killing cannibal dewbacks, snorbals, voritor lizards, and a rancor.\nQakkee appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
