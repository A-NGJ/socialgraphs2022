 "content": "Swifty Yonsen was a mercenary with a reputation which made hardened criminals take pause. Most people who were aware of Yonsen's reputation would back down or panic when faced with him. This fearsome reputation was largely undeserved, being largely the result of exaggerated rumors rather than any exceptional skill or talent as a gunslinger.\nWhile on StarForge Station Yonsen responded to a call by Captain Dhas Vedij to join the crew of the Rebel privateer vessel Far Orbit.",
