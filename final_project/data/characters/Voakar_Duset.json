 "content": "Voakar Duset was a Neimoidian on Mustafar some time during the Galactic Civil War. He spent his time lingering around a camp of Mustafarian miners on strike, although his reasons for doing so were uncertain.\nVoakar Duset appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Voakar Duset's presence on Mustafar is something of a mysteryâ€”he is the only known Neimoidian NPC in the entire game, yet he is apparently unconnected with any quests whatsoever.\nThe list of NPCs in Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide lists Duset's social group  as \"must bandit\". All other members of this social group belong to the Salvage bandits.",
