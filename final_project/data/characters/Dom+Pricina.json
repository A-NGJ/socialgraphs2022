 "content": "Dom Pricina was a wealthy Human female. She had in her possession the Ankarres Sapphire, and charged people dearly to make use of its supposed healing powers. She was fond of rich foods, and had dessert courses with every meal, and as a result was quite obese.\nSometime before the Battle of Yavin, Pricina was traveling on the Kuari Princess. While on board, she kept carelessly misplacing priceless articles of jewelry. It was her forgetfulness that convinced the droid 4-LOM—who worked as a valet on the luxury liner— that Humans were incompetent and didn't deserve their valuables. He stole the sapphire from her and began a life of crime.",
