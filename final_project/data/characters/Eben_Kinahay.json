 "content": "Eben Kinahay was a male Human from the planet Talus. Kinahay lived on an estate located on an island on the Sapphire Lake, in the settlement Hollowtown on Centerpoint Station. An antiquities dealer and collecter, Kinahay owned a Sith holocron, which had been recovered from a derelict starship on the planet Ziost. He expected that his son, Zyne Kinahay, would follow in his footsteps as an antiquities dealer, and he allowed Zyne access to his vast collection, in hope that doing so would cause Zyne to develop a passion for ancient art. However, unknown to Eben, Zyne was Force-sensitive and studied from Eben's holocron.",
