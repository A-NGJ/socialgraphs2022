 "content": "Valwid Ined was a brilliant male Vobati who found work as a forger on the moon Jedha during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Ined provided fake transit visas to members of the rebel Saw Gerrera's Partisans movement so that they could move through Imperial checkpoints in Jedha City without issue. The forger was present in Jedha City in 0 BBY when the Alliance to Restore the Republic agents Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor passed Ined in the street shortly before the settlement was destroyed by the Empire's Death Star superlaser. Ined wore a brown full-body suit that included a face-covering headpiece.\nValwid Ined first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016. The character was not named in the film but received identification in the accompanying reference book, Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film.",
