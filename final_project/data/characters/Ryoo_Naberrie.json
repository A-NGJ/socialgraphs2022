 "content": "Ryoo Naberrie was a human female child and the daughter of Sola Naberrie. She was also the maternal niece of Padmé Amidala, making her the cousin to Anakin Skywalker and Amidala's twins, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.\nRyoo Naberrie was a human female who was born into the Naberrie family in 28 BBY. Her mother, Sola, was uninterested in having a partner, although she was comfortable with having children, a position not uncommon on Naboo. Ryoo was raised on her people's home planet of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic, along with her sister, Pooja. Her aunt, Padmé Amidala, met her shortly after she was born. \nShortly before the Clone Wars began, Senator Amidala and the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker visited the Naberrie family. Amidala died after giving birth to twins, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who were fathered by Anakin. After the Clone Wars, the Naberries attended Amidala's funeral.\nNaberrie had brown hair, brown eyes, and fair skin.\nRyoo wore a black hooded dress to show her mourning at her aunt's funeral.\nRyoo Naberrie was played by the actress Keira Wingate. She appeared in scenes deleted from Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, before officially appearing in Amidala's funeral in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.",
