 "content": "Tabbins Vee was an Imperial stormtrooper who, in 3 ABY, served in Lieutenant Mils Giel's expedition to investigate the formerly Rebel-held Golrath Station. Vee was a graduate of the Imperial Academy, where he was eternally in the shadow of his roommate Bens Figgâ€”while Figg was considered a rising star and future officer material from the moment he arrived, Vee was regarded as second-best in all respects. Vee and Figg were assigned to Golrath Station together after leaving the Academy, but their first posting didn't last long. Vee was surprised and incapacitated by Rebel saboteur Leia Organa while on duty, and was caught in the explosion when Organa destroyed the facility shortly afterward.",
