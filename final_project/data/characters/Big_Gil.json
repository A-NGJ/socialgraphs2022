 "content": "Big Gil was a Human merchant who lived on the planet Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. A brown haired Human male with brown eyes and three large scars across his left eye, Big Gil wore heavy armor for protection from the world's wildlife. He sold heavy armor from his shop in Olaris, the headquarters of the Republic-sponsored Taris Resettlement Initiative.\nBig Gil appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Heavy Armor Vendor for Republic players on Taris. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, he was removed from the game along with the rest of the Heavy Armor Vendors.",
