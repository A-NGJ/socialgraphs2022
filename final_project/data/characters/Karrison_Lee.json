 "content": "Karrison Lee was a smuggler who was fond of gambling even though he was not particularly good at it. He was a patron at the Ace of Sabres on the planet Kluistar.\nHe had been imprisoned by the Empire at least three times, but always managed to escape. He also had been double-crossed and sold out by friends and partners many times, so he was very reluctant to trust others.\nKarrin was a typical brash smuggler who also enjoyed almost every form of gambling although he rarely won. He was personable and easy-going although because of his occupation and history he was reluctant to move beyond small talk. He was willing to transport almost anything anywhere anytime as long as the price was right.\nHe owned a modified YT-2000 light freighter called the Distant Sunrise. He also carried around a heavy blaster pistol.\nKarrison Lee was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.",
