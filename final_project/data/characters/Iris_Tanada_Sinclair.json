 "content": "Iris Tanada Sinclair was a Chadra-Fan slicer in the employ of Lady Valarian that lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Sinclair was part of a group of 'outside help' hired by the Whiphid crime lord Lady Valarian to act as her command staff in raids against her rival, the Hutt, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Sinclair, along with the rest of the group; Careem, Fnast Drexler, Arkahn Greystar and Emanon, setup headquarters in the Valarian Strategic Command Bunker on the planet Tatooine where they were guarded by a large number of Valarian's guards and Blood Vandals. From this bunker they launched and coordinated their attacks on Jabba. Sinclair was eventually killed along with all of the other commanders by a spacer hired by Jabba to stop the raids.\nIris Tanada Sinclair was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Iris Tanada Sinclair was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Jabba's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005. One of the missions from Jabba himself asked the player to kill Tyrok.",
