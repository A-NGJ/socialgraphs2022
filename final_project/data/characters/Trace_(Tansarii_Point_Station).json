 "content": "Trace was a Human male who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he lived on Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. In 1 ABY, his friend Han Solo arrived on the station with Chewbacca and a spacer aboard the Millennium Falcon. The ship needed repairs after a skirmish with Imperial forces but the staff of the station was not eager to help. Trace informed the spacer that the bounty hunter Boba Fett was present on the station, with Solo on his top target list, and that was the reason why nobody would help the smuggler. The spacer therefore rushed to find replacement parts for the Millennium Falcon while Solo and Chewbacca hurried to repair the starship. They finally left Tansarii Point Station before Boba Fett could even notice their presence on the station.\nTrace appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Trace was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
