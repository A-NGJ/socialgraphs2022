 "content": "Distant Star was a fathier female that mated with Hydian Dreams and gave birth to the fathier named Kessel Runner as a result. By around 34 ABY, Kessel Runner had become a racing fathier on the planet Cantonica ridden by the jockey Arca Yroca and owned by the crime lord Sturg Ganna. Distant Star was listed as the fathier's dam on race programs, including one collected by the Resistance mechanic Rose Tico and added to her diary.\nDistant Star was first mentioned in the 2018 replica journal The Last Jedi: Rose Tico: Resistance Fighter, which was written by Jason Fry.",
