 "content": "During the Clone Wars, a clone trooper pilot served as a lieutenant and as one of the pilots for a Republic gunship. The Clone Lieutenant participated in the opening of the Battle of Teth, by bringing members of Torrent Company to the planet. Once the gunships had entered the atmosphere and were heading to the B'omarr Order Monastery, battle droids at the monastery began to fire on the gunships. The lieutenant reported to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who was among the members of Torrent Company his gunship was carrying, that the gunships were taking heavy fire from Separatist droids, and was ordered by Skywalker to close the blast shields on the gunship due to this. After this the pilot landed the gunship, so that Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and the other members of Torrent Company his gunship was carrying could scale the Teth monastery.",
