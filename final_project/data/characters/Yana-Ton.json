 "content": "Yana-Ton was a female Voss living on Voss during the Cold War. She was the sister of Phi-Ton and a daughter of Bas-Ton and resided in her father's tea house in the Judicial Quarter of the Voss-Ka city. At some point prior to 3640 BBY Bas-Ton was killed and replaced with an impostor by the Imperial Intelligence of the Sith Empire. Neither of his children, nor even his brother Therod-Ton ever suspected anything. Around 3640 BBY, another Imperial Agent, Cipher Nine, made several visits to the teahouse and pretended to become friends with the family. In reality, Cipher required contact and assistance from the Bas-Ton's impostor in their joint mission to track the Shining Man. Bas-Ton's impostor was later killed by Cipher's old enemies and Yana-Ton grieved at the loss, never knowing her father's true fate.\nYana-Ton can be romanced by and married to Cipher Nine if male and playing light side.",
