 "content": "A veteran of the Clone Wars was a human male clone of Jango Fett who once served as a clone trooper in the elite 501st Legion of the Galactic Republic's Grand Army of the Republic. By 9 BBY, he had come to reside on the streets of the planet of Daiyu after being abandoned due to the Galactic Empire's Project War-Mantle, and he once begged the rogue Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi for credits in order to pay for a meal.\nIn approximately 29 BBY, a human male clone of Jango Fett was born on Kamino and participated in the Clone Wars—against the Confederacy of Independent Systems—as a clone trooper in the elite 501st Legion of the Galactic Republic's Grand Army of the Republic. After the Galactic Empire rose to power, it introduced Project War-Mantle to replace clone troopers with volunteering and conscripted soldiers, which left the clone trooper destitute and abandoned.\nBy 9 BBY, he resided, homeless, on the planet Daiyu. While on the planet, the veteran's age acceleration and past experiences had left him worse for wear, and he was forgotten by others, forcing him to beg for credits to survive. In that year, the clone begged Jedi Master–in-hiding Obi-Wan Kenobi—who was searching for the kidnapped princess of Alderaan, Leia Organa—for credits in order to pay for a meal. Kenobi obliged, throwing some credits into the clone's helmet while hiding his lightsaber from view with his robe. The clone nodded to Kenobi in appreciation, who then walked away after solemnly staring at the homeless veteran for a brief moment.\nAround 9 BBY, the clone veteran had tan skin; long, shaggy, black hair; and a disheveled, graying beard and mustache. As a clone trooper, he stood 1.83 meters tall and had brown eyes.\nWhile living in a homeless condition on Daiyu, the clone veteran wore dirty Phase II clone trooper armor adorned with the blue markings of the 501st Legion and was in possession of an accompanying helmet, which he used as a bucket to collect credits. His arms were bandaged, and he wore a green poncho. Although he still wore the boots that came with his armor, he did not wear the leg and waist components, instead wearing a pair of brown pants.\nThe clone veteran appeared in \"Part II\" of the limited series Obi-Wan Kenobi, directed by Deborah Chow and released on May 26, 2022. Like other live-action clone troopers in the prequel trilogy films Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode II Revenge of the Sith, he was portrayed by Temuera Morrison.\nMorrison enjoyed his cameo and stated that it was the best thing in the series, but he felt that it was too short. He liked that the veteran had hair and a beard growing out, and it was the first time that Morrison wore physical clone trooper armor while portraying a clone, as in previous portrayals the armor was rendered using CGI.",
