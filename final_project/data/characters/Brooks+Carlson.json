 "content": "Brooks Carlson was a human male who was a sergeant in the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Pathfinders unit during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. By 4 ABY, he was considered a veteran and had trained the communications operative Corporal Beezer. In that year, Carlson was an automatic choice for a strike team made up of volunteer commandos that was put together by General Han Solo and Major Bren Derlin for a mission to the moon of Endor. The team, which also included Beezer, were tasked with destroying the Imperial shield generator that protected the Death Star II superweapon.\nThe team arrived on the moon in the stolen Imperial shuttle Tydirium and proceeded to a security bunker at the rear of the generator. At the bunker, they fell into an Imperial trap, but overcame the Imperial forces with aid from the local Ewok population, allowing them to destroy the generator. This allowed for the destruction of the Death Star by the Alliance Fleet above. Carlson had light skin, brown eyes, and gray hair. He wore a green helmet, a white shirt, and a green-and-brown camouflaged duster.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, Brooks Carlson was pictured in an entry for Rebel troopers on the StarWars.com Encyclopedia. The character was then identified in the English release of \"The Battle of Endor and the Fall of the Empire,\" an entry in De Agostini's Star Wars Encyclopedia series that was originally released in Spanish on June 29, 2021.\nThe image used in the Encyclopedia entry was a promotional photo taken for the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, although Carlson does not appear in the film itself. The photo depicts Carlson, portrayed by stuntman Alf Joint, and other commandos stood with protagonist Luke Skywalker as their prisoner in one of the Death Star II's corridors. The name Beezer originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on two cards in the 1999 Endor Limited expansion set of the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
