 "content": "Sterla was a male Human citizen of the Eternal Empire living during the Galactic War. A member of the Knights of Zakuul, following the Coronation of Empress Vaylin he was hand-picked by her to join the new Horizon Guard. However, Sterla soon went into exile following the disgraced Battalion Commander Tassar. Tassar's followers revered her zealously as a cult formed around her. Eventually they intercepted an Alliance transport with samples for Juvard Illip Oggurobb, allowing Tassar to discover Rakata Prime and the technology of the Infinite Empire, which she wanted to use to upgrade the Star Fortress design to be completely indestructible. Tassar and her followers made significant progress in constructing a new Star Fortress on Rakata Prime's surface, however following the death of Vaylin in 3630 BBY they were discovered by the Eternal Alliance forces. A strike team was dispatched to stop Tassar and her efforts, which confronted and killed Sterla.\nScout Captain Sterla appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as a boss during the \"Landing Party\" Uprising.",
