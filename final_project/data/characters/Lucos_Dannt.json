 "content": "Lucos Dannt was originally a headmaster at the Naboo Royal House of Learning.\nHowever, with the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, he became a leader of a resistance group referred to as the Naboo Underground. He was well-informed about the development of the situation and had many contacts, including members of the Royal Naboo Security Forces. This made him a good at designing missions for his agents, which included liberation of prisoners and theft of weapons among other things.",
