 "content": "Flash Harrison was a Human male pilot that lived during the Galactic Civil War. He worked as a mining pilot for the Corellian Engineering Corporation.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin Harrison was working on a space mining project in the Kashyyyk system. When the Empire suspected him to be a Rebel sympathizer, his ship was confiscated. Harrison was stuck on the Wookiee world â€” and he couldn't stand Wookiees.\nHe finally met a spacer in Kachirho who agreed to deliver a message to CEC representative Thom Steele on Talus.\nFlash Harrison is a Non-Player Character  in Rage of the Wookiees, the second addon to Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. He can be found on the first level of the great tree in Kachirho. Harrison asks the player to travel to Talus and talk to Thom Steele, starting a quest that introduces the player to space mining, a new feature of Rage of the Wookiees.",
