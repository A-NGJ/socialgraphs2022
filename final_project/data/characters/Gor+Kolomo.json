 "content": "Gor Kolomo was a male Twi'lek who traveled to Uffel to investigate it for mineral exploitation. However, he and his companion were killed when their ship crashed. He was survived by his droid QS-2D who eventually claimed its own independence. QS-2D maintained the fiction that Kolomo was alive and the proprietor of the X2-4 droid-manufacturing plant on Uffel. In this capacity, QS sent out holograms of Kolomo to maintain the fiction of his survival. In 31 BBY, Kolomo announced to the Cularin system that droid manufacture was halted by a debris storm. This caused a stir throughout the Cularin system, which had a high demand for Uffel droids. Shortly after this, he recruited some heroes from Cularin for some investigative work. It turned out that a rogue droid LN-73 was trying to take over the manufacturing plant, and the heroes had to foil these plans.\nKolomo's hologram was not prefect quality. In it he moved jerkily and had a facial tic under his left eye.",
