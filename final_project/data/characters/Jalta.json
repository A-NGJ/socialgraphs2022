 "content": "Jalta was a Human male from Corellia who served as a member of the Corellian Council during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. He was executed by the Sith for refusing to serve the Empire.\nAs a fellow council member, Jalta was brave and saw how evil the Sith were, and would never allow him and other Corellians to serve them.\nJalta is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game, appearing in the Corellia Empire story.\nIf Darbin Sull is spared, when he encourages his fellow councilors to bow to their new rulers, Jalta will defiantly refuse, calling Sull an Imperial puppet. The player can either execute or spare Jalta.\nIf Sull is executed, Jalta will brazenly attack the player character but is disabled. As above, he can be spared or executed.",
