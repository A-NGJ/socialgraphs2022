 "content": "A Kadas'sa'Nikto was one of several of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's men who traveled with Ki-Adi-Mundi into the Jundland Wastes in search of the lost Jedi Sharad Hett. He was killed when he and the other thugs attacked Ki-Adi-Mundi during a sandstorm, which they hoped would bury his body once they killed him and threw him from the Skiff they where using as transport. During the battle the Skiff crashed due to the death of the driver and so ironically it was the thugs who ended up buried beneath the sands while the Jedi escaped.",
