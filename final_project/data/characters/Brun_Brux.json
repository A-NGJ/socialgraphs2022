 "content": "Brun Brux was a Human male from the planet Alderaan who was the proprietor of Tasia's Tapcafé, a restaurant on the Wheel space station, during the Galactic Civil War. After the destruction of his homeworld by the Galactic Empire, Brux's restaurant became a gathering place for those who hated the Empire.\nBrun Brux, a Human male, originated from the planet Alderaan, but during the Galactic Civil War—a conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic—he lived and worked on the Wheel space station in the Besh Gorgon system of the Mid Rim. On the station, he ran Tasia's Tapcafé, which specialized in food from his homeworld, on a hangar deck level. After the Empire's destruction of Alderaan, his restaurant turned into a rallying point for other Alderaanian survivors and those harboring hatred for the Empire. Brux feared drawing the ire of the Imperial Security Bureau and so discouraged open rebellion amongst his customers, focusing instead on collecting pieces of Alderaanian spirit and culture.\nBrux was thin and bearded during the time he worked on the Wheel. Prior to the destruction of Alderaan, Brux was more concerned with the running of his restaurant than he was with any galactic politics. After the loss of his homeworld, however, Brux became sad and angry, commiserating with the other survivors and anti-Imperialists who frequented his tapcafe. His fear of trouble from the Imperial Security Bureau outweighed any wish for anti-Imperial action he had, and so he discouraged open rebellion amongst dissenters in his shop. Nonetheless, he hoped to one day join the Alliance himself, although he was unsure whom to trust with such matters.\nBrun Brux was first introduced in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey in 2013 for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. He was one individual with whom players could potentially interact while searching for information during the first episode of the game.\nInterviewed in Star Wars Insider 157 for the magazine's Red Five department, actor John Morton, who played Dak Ralter in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, named Brun Brux as one of his five favorite Star Wars freedom fighters. Morton compared Brux to actor Humphrey Bogart's character Rick Blaine in the classic film Casablanca, lauding Brux's wily ability to maneuver his way among the galaxy's myriad dangerous patrons all while facilitating the Rebel Alliance.",
