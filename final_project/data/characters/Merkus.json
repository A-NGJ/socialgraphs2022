 "content": "Merkus was a male Human who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war he lived on the capital planet of the Republic, Coruscant where he worked in the Equipment Requisitions area of the Senate Commercial District as a vendor of various equipment.\nMerkus appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Equipment Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Coruscant. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Merkus was removed from the game along with the rest of the Equipment Commendations Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, which incorrectly labeled him as \"Foley.\"",
