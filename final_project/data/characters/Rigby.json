In 3640 BBY, during the battle of Corellia, Rigby led a unit in capturing the Daoba Hotel in Coronet City and held dozens of civilians inside hostage for several days while they installed heavy artillery atop the building. However, his plan failed when he and his unit were killed by Jedi and military effort and the hostages were freed.",
