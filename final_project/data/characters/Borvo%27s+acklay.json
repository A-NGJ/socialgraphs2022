 "content": "Borvo's acklay was an acklay owned by the Hutt crime lord Borvo during the Galactic Civil War. It was kept in Borvo's Vault near Moenia on Naboo. Borvo the Hutt has been raising exotic creatures for the sole purpose of creating a new armor for his personal army. In 1 ABY, a spacer entered the vault to retrieve an Old Republic decentralized autonomy chip droid module. The spacer killed the acklay and took pieces of its carapace and gave them to the armorsmith Dakk who made a suit of acklay armor out of it.\nBorvo's acklay appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Borvo's acklay was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. A secondary quest involving the acklay chest armor piece was later added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28,\" on April 26, 2006.",
