 "content": "Ten Numb was a male Sullustan starfighter pilot that flew for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. During the Battle of Endor, he flew a B-wing starfighter under the callsign Blue Five.\nTen Numb was a male Sullustan bounty hunter hailing from the planet Sullust. Numb sought to use his expertise in demolitions to aid the Alliance to Restore the Republic in their fight against the Galactic Empire.\nTen Numb was one of a few Sullustan pilots that flew at the Battle of Endor, including his friend Nien Nunb who also flew at the Battle of Endor as Lando Calrissian's co-pilot on board the Millennium Falcon. Ten Numb, on the other hand, was assigned to Blue Squadron, piloting a B-wing starfighter under the callsign Blue Five. During the assault, Numb led Blue Squadron in an attack against Imperial command ships, resulting in the destruction of two Imperial Star Destroyers. Numb survived the engagement and was one of a number of pilots to join the festivities at Bright Tree Village on the Forest Moon below.\nTen Numb was portrayed by creature technician Mike Quinn in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. An unscripted scene of Ten Numb inside a B-wing cockpit was filmed for Return of the Jedi; however, the scene was deleted. In the shot, Numb could be seen wearing a green uniform, instead of the red B-wing suit seen in the film.\nTen Numb is often confused with fellow Sullustan pilot Nien Nunb.\nEarly Star Wars media mistakenly portrayed Ten Numb as having a white suit. This confusion may have been caused by early preproduction photos from Return of the Jedi featuring Ten Numb wearing a white outfit. The \"incorrect\" photos of Ten Numb have since been digitally recolored to better match his film appearance.",
