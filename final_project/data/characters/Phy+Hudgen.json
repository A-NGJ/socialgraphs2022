 "content": "Phy Hudgen was a Human male Imperial contract worker who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Hudgen was hired by Colonel Bors Teraud for the purpose of expanding the The Warren, an Imperial Research Facility on the planet Dantooine. However, chaos erupted, forcing Hudgen to hole up in one of the facility's rooms. He eventually encountered a spacer who was tasked by the Empire to investigate the situation.\nPhy Hudgen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
