 "content": "Mafole was a Chiss female who served as the fourth caregiver of the sky-walker Al'iastov, a young girl who navigated the space outside of the Chiss Ascendancy government's borders using the ability of Third Sight. She became the girl's caregiver after the previous one was taken away. Around 39 BBY, the pair served aboard the Chiss Defense Force Transport Tomra.\nAs the ship never traveled outside Ascendancy borders, it did not have a sky-walker suite, and Mafole and Al'iastov were given space in the captain's quarters. The caregiver had complained about not having a suite to the ship's captain, Junior Captain Vorlip, resulting in a fight between the two. Afterward, Mafole refused to leave the captain's quarters until the Tomra reached the planet Naporar and ordered her sky-walker to walk between the bridge and Vorlip's room alone.\nMafole was mentioned in the 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, the first volume of Timothy Zahn's The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
