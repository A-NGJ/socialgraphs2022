 "content": "Mazie was a female Twi'lek from Ryloth living in the final years of the Galactic Republic.\nMazie and her daughter, Berri, were enslaved under the crime-lord Krayn and forced to labor in the spice-processing facilities on Nar Shaddaa. She befriended Anakin Skywalker and made it her business to relieve the discomforts of  her fellow slaves. Mazie helped Skywalker to persuade the slaves to revolt against Krayn, resulting ultimately in their freedom.\nMazie and her family had moved to Tatooine from Ryloth in 39 BBY, in order to avoid slavery, only to be seized and cast into slavery later by Krayn. Mazie's destiny was a sad one, however, as she later died in a tragic shootout.",
