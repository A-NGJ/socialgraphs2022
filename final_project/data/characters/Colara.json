 "content": "Colara was a female Wookiee who was employed as a bouncer in Saludi's, a cantina in the Coruscant Undercity. Around 31 BBY, while on duty at Saludi's, Colara ejected a drunken Gamorrean from the bar. Shortly thereafter, she encountered a group of spacers who were searching for some Sith cultists operating out of a secret hideout near to the cantina.\nColara was a Wookiee female who lived on the planet Coruscant during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, where she worked as a bouncer at the cantina Saludi's in the Coruscant undercity. Around 31 BBY, while on duty the bar one evening, Colara spotted a group of bellicose pilots of the Mecetti House Guard, a military force from the Tapani sector, drinking in Saludi's and she kept close tabs on their behavior, waiting for an excuse to throw them out. Later that night, she observed a group of Believers, Sith-worshipping cultists from the Cularin system, rushing through the bar, en-route to their secret hideout that could be accessed from a concealed back room of Saludi's. Though she did not know who the cultists were or what their purpose was in the bar, Colara paid no heed to their activities because, being Humans, she saw the Believers as smaller and weaker than her and therefore did not register them as a threat.\nMinutes after the Believers had passed through Saludi's, Colara forcefully ejected a drunken 400 kilogram Gamorrean from the cantina. At that moment, a team of spacers hired by the Jedi, an order of Force users headquartered on Coruscant, arrived at the cantina in pursuit of the Believers. Colara stepped aside and smiled at the spacers as they made their way into the bar.\nThe Jedi-allied spacers made enquiries to Colara about the location of the Believers' secret hideout and the bouncer reported to them details of her sighting of the cultists who had passed through the bar. After a Wookiee member of the spacer team agreed to go on a date with her, Colara also disclosed to the spacers the existence of the hidden back room of Saludi's and provided details on how to access it, via the cantina's restroom. Subsequently, the spacers found the entrance to the Believers base and confronted the cultists.\nColara was a healthy Wookiee and large and strong, even by the standards of her species, which were renowned for their size and robustness. She flirtatious toward other Wookiees and aside from some missing teeth was considered attractive by others of her race. She was courteous and professional while on duty as a bouncer at Saludi's and was not interested in any bribes offered to her. A diligent bouncer, she focussed her attention on looking out for potential trouble-makers in the bar.\nColara was created by Morrie Mullins and appeared in Coruscani Dawn, a 2002 roleplaying adventure that formed part of RPGA's Living Force campaign. In the adventure, the players roleplay as the spacers who come to Saludi's while tracking the Believers. It is possible for the players to interact with Colara and make inquiries to her regarding the cultists. Only if one of the player characters is a Wookiee and that character agrees to go on a date with her does Colara reveal to the players details of the Saludi's hidden back room and provide them information on how to enter it. It is also possible during the adventure for a brawl to break out between the player characters and the House Mecetti pilots drinking in the bar, in which case Colara quickly intervenes to break up the fight.",
