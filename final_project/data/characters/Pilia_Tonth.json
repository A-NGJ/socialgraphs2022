 "content": "Pilia Tonth was the captain of the Imperial Survey Corps Far*Reach IV PQR Wanderer at the time of its crash on the crystalline world of Isis.\nPilia Tonth was a small, sturdy woman with short black hair and a pixie nose. As the daughter of a member of the Imperial Navy, Tonth received an easy appointment with the Imperial Survey Corps based on nepotism rather than ability. For this reason, Tonth wanted promotion to a position which she believed was more worthy of someone of her ability.\nTonth was a serious woman who enjoyed puzzles, but became annoyed when stumped. She saw herself as someone doing an important job rather than a reckless adventurer, but was willing to risk her ship and crew to get promotion out of the Survey Corps.",
