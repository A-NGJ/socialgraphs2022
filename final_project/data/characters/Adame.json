 "content": "Adame was a male human smuggler who was a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Along with Selentia, Adame approached another smuggler, Han Solo, requesting to borrow his ship, the Millennium Falcon to travel to the Gomar sector as part of a mission on behalf of Leia Organa.\nAdame and Selentia followed Han Solo from the last planet he visited to the one he was currently at. After he saw that his companion was made, he pointed his blaster at Solo and asked to have a word with him. When they arrived at the \"Millennium Falcon\", Adame happily greeted Chewbacca as an old acquaintance and friend. Adame later explained that they were sent by Leia Organa to pilot the ship to the Gomar sector. Solo outright denied permission to use his ship for any mission concerning the Rebellion especially if he was not going to pilot his own ship.\nAdame first appeared in Han Solo 1, a 2016 comic book written by Marjorie Liu and illustrated by Mark Brooks.",
