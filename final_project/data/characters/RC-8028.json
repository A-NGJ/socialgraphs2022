 "content": "RC-8028, nicknamed \"Two-Eight,\" was a clone commando created on the Wild Space planet Kamino at some point during or after 32 BBY. As a male Human clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, he stood 1.83 meters tall. Two-Eight was trained by Cuy'val Dar sergeant Kal Skirata to serve in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army.\nAt some point before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, he was decapitated in a training exercise with his squad on Kamino as a result of his own mishandling of explosives during a rapid entry procedure. Although he was quickly replaced with another commando, the loss of Two-Eight would haunt the squad's sergeant, RC-1309, sometime after his death.\nTwo-Eight was first mentioned in the 2004 novel Hard Contact, the first novel in the Republic Commando series written by Karen Traviss. In the 2008 reference book The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, the trooper was given the full designation of RC-8028.",
