 "content": "The male shanjaru was the last male member of shanjaru, a species that was driven nearly to extinction at the time of the Cold War. Drooga the Hutt possessed the last female shanjaru and wished to complete the set in order to serve them as part of his feast. Risha Drayen obtained the male shanjaru and traded him to Drooga in exchange for a prototype engine.\nThe male shanjaru appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Smuggler class story.",
