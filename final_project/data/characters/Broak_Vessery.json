 "content": "Broak Vessery was a male Human TIE fighter pilot who held the rank of colonel in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire.\nBroak Vessery was a pilot of the Imperial Navy who served under Ysanne Isard following the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn.\nColonel Vessery's two TIE/D Defender squadrons, Interloper Squadron and Stranger Squadron, were soon ordered by Isard to rescue the New Republic's elite Rogue Squadron from above Corvis Minor V, following a trap laid by Isard's clone and Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel. Following the engagement, Vessery revealed that he counted the deaths of Rogue pilots—which included two dead, Khe-Jeen Slee and Lyyr Zatoq and two severely injured, Wes Janson and Asyr Sei'lar—as failures on his part and that, though a near impossibility, he should have been able to save them.\nVessery, coupled with an unnamed Imperial flight instructor, under orders from Isard, then proceeded to train the surviving Rogues in the use of the Imperial TIE/D Defender, in the hope that an alliance between rival forces could be infiltrated into Krennel's forces and used to bring the rogue warlord down.\nRequiem Squadron, under the command of Wedge Antilles' alter ego Antar Roat, managed to infiltrate Krennel's forces and brought down the planetary shields protecting Ciutric. In the aftermath of the liberation of Ciutric and the deaths of Krennel, Isard's clone, and Isard herself, Vessery fled with two complete squadrons of TIE Defenders and their pilots.\nVessery was described as a tall, black-haired officer with sharp, noble features. He also had a nervous habit of picking invisible pieces of lint from his uniform and was very thoughtful about what he said.",
