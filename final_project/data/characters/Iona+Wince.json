 "content": "Iona Wince was a female Wroonian, who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nWhen Wince was eleven, the Sullustan liner Starlite Cloud stopped by the planet Wroona and she stowed away aboard it. She was discovered by the ship's captain, who took a liking to her and put her to work as a steward. The young girl joined the Rebel Alliance and made it easier for Alliance operatives to book passage on the Cloud, by keeping watch for bounty hunters and Imperial agents. She also listened in on conversations about Imperial actions against the Alliance and could use her steward's pass card to access any part of the ship.",
