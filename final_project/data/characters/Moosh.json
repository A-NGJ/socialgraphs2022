 "content": "Moosh was one of several members of the Hutt species on the planet Sleheyron around 3956 BBY. One of Moosh's rivals was Suuda, another Hutt on the planet.\nMoosh was originally planned to be part of the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, but was cut from the final release. This was revealed by one of the game's writers, David Gaider, in a post on the now-defunct Knights of the Old Republic forums. In this and several other posts, he mentioned Moosh while elaborating on the planet Sleheyron, which received only a mention in the final release. The Hutts on Sleheyron, including Moosh, were intended to give the player's character jobs known as side quests.",
