 "content": "The Breeder was an ancient Rakata who lived in the years of their people's Infinite Empire. His name stemmed from the fact that he was known to have created countless monstrous and horrific animals which he left within a jungle prison vault on the planet Belsavis. The passion of the Breeder was the art of creation with the beasts he crafted being his greatest achievement. He was also responsible for the imprisonment of a fellow Rakata within a mind prison who later took the name of the Vengeful One as he desired revenge against the Breeder. However, the Breeder died thousands of years ago and during the Cold War, the Vengeful One instead shifted his vengeance onto the Breeder's abominable creations who he tasked to a Sith Empire member that awakened him.",
