 "content": "A human male farmer owned a farm on the planet Naboo. He had brown eyes, long brown hair, and light-colored skin. The farmer wore a white long-sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows and a beige covering over his legs. A brown belt on his waist had both a small pouch and a large bag holding several tools.\nOn Naboo, the farmer was in need of rare farming supplies from the planet Takodana. He secretly asked a travelling mercenary to retrieve and deliver the valuable cargo, paying seven thousand credits upon receiving the supplies.\nThe farmer was introduced in the 2019 Fantasy Flight Games board game, Star Wars: Outer Rim, as part of an encounter on Naboo and was illustrated by Laura Csajagi. A wider version of the image illustrating the farmer was originally used in the Star Wars Legends continuity to depict the planet Ruusan and a Ruusanian colonist in Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: The Card Game expansion Knowledge and Defense, released in 2014.",
