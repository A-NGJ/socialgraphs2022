 "content": "Anathemos was a Human male Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nDuring the Cold War, Lord Anathemos was stationed at the Empire's outpost on Taris. He was on the search for a holocron, but he had no luck in finding it. However, the Sith Inquisitor was able to find it and bring it to him. Anathemos wasn't fooled and believed it was a trap that the Inquisitor was trying to lure him into. The Inquisitor would give the holocron in exchange for his assassins in order to lure Ashara Zavros to the dark side.",
