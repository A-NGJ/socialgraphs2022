 "content": "Bob Hudsol was a male human who served as a commander and later general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. Hudsol was killed when his starship was destroyed during the assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks.\nBob Hudsol was a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. When the Alliance attacked the Empire's Death Star battlestation in the Battle of Yavin, Hudsol monitored the attack from the Rebel strategy center in the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4. After Death Star was successfully destroyed, Hudsol attended an award ceremony in the temple where the pilot Luke Skywalker and the smuggler Han Solo received medals. As soon as the ceremony ended the Rebels rushed to evacuate Yavin.\nAfter a failed attempt to persuade Regent Dors Urtya of Mon Cala to join the Rebel Alliance, Hudsol had been promoted to the rank of general, and was present at an Alliance High Command meeting during which Princess Leia Organa detailed a plan to rescue King Lee-Char in order to sway the Mon Calamari to join the rebel cause. As the fleet assembled at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Hudsol's ship was the first one completely outfitted and the first to pass through tests. During the assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks by the Empire's Death Squadron, Hudsol was in his starship when it was destroyed and exploded in a fireball, killing him.\nHudsol had fair skin, brown eyes, gray hair, and a prominent mustache.\nBob Hudsol was played uncredited by actor John William Ault in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in 1977. The character did not receive a name until he appeared in 1996 on a card in the A New Hope Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game by Decipher, Inc. Hudsol's name was confirmed to be canon in the reference book Ultimate Star Wars, which was released in 2015.",
