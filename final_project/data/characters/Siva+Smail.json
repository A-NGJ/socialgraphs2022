 "content": "Siva Smail was a female Twi'lek who had a set of lekku that were adorned with intricate patterns that were red and yellow in color. Smail served the Galactic Empire and sometime after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, she traveled to the Imperial Data Processing Facility on the world Tazan, so that she could give a presentation on the subject of a new planned maintenance system for AT-ATs. While Smail prepared for her presentation inside the base's presentation room, she encountered a team of Rebel Alliance agents that had infiltrated the facility. The agents sought to recover a set of TIE fighter communication protocols and Smail pretended to help them, by claiming that she would lead them to someone that knew about the protocols. However, she then covertly attempted to alert the base's staff that the facility's security had been breached.",
