 "content": "Mart Stevez was a member of the Atrisian Royal Corps and later the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Imperials killed his whole family while he was on a training mission. They claimed that his father had become politically unstable and needed to be removed. Stevez then became a respected member of the Alliance Special Forces. He was eventually promoted to the rank of Major, and he was given command of Taskforce Shen. He led Taskforce Shen in many successful missions throughout the Mid Rim.",
