 "content": "Uta S'orn was a female Human Senator of the Galactic Republic who represented Belasco until her retirement and subsequent arrest in 43 BBY. Her son, Ren S'orn, was Force-sensitive.\nFollowing her retirement, she withdrew to her home planet Belasco where she worked with the scientist Jenna Zan Arbor who had secretly introduced a virus into the water supply. They planned to create the anti-virus that would save the planet and in doing so, achieve money and fame. However, these plans were foiled by Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Adi Gallia and Padawans Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi. S'orn was subsequently sent to live out her remaining years on a prison planet.",
