 "content": "A clone naval officer served under the command of Jedi General Even Piell around 21 BBY during the events of the Clone Wars.\nDuring an attack by Separatist forces on Even Piell's cruiser, this clone naval officer was taken along with Piell and several other surviving crew members and transferred to a prison known as The Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu.\nDue to the knowledge Piell had on the Nexus Route, an elite strike team lead by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker entered the prison to rescue Piell. When the team learned that Piell had given part of the information to Wilhuff Tarkin, a new plan was devised so that Tarkin and the other officers could also be rescued. Deciding to spilt up to better protect the information, this naval officer went with Kenobi's team. Escaping through a ventilation hatch to reach the outside of the prison, the naval officer reached a landing platform with the rest of the group but was taken prisoner by the Citadel's warden, Osi Sobeck. With help from R2-D2's battle droid squadron, the naval officer and Kenobi's team got back to the shuttle and a firefight ensued once the droids learned of the prisoners escape with re-programmed battle droids. The naval officer took cover with the rest of the group and when Skywalker's forces re-joined the team, the naval officer witnessed the death of CT-21-0408 and the destruction of the shuttle. The naval officer retreated and continued to a landing point where Plo Koon would pick up any survivors. To track down the survivors, Sobeck released a pack of Anoobas and Single Trooper Aerial Platforms to hunt down the group. While Piell and Ahsoka Tano were fending off LM-432 crab droids, the clones went to assist Kenobi and Skywalker in battle. When a STAP began to fire down at Tarkin, the naval officer pushed Tarkin out of the way and took the shots himself, killing him.",
