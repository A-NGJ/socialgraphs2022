 "content": "Dua Ningo was an elderly Sullustan male who operated in the Commerce Guild's Sullustan Home Guard as an admiral. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ningo, alongside the Commerce Guild, joined the Confederacy, where he continued to serve as an admiral for the Confederacy's naval forces.\nWhile serving the forces, Ningo was charged with overseeing defense in the Sullust sector and the interests of SoroSuub Corporation. He was also tasked with supervising the construction of a Separatist flotilla of Bulwark-class battle cruisers, which he hoped would be completed two years after the war's inception. Ningo also desired to utilize the cruisers in an attack on the Republic capital planet of Coruscant.\nDua Ningo was first mentioned in the current Star Wars canon in Rise of the Separatists, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Dua Ningo was introduced in The New Essential Chronology, a 2005 reference book authored by Daniel Wallace and Kevin J. Anderson.",
