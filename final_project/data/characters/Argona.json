 "content": "Argona was the male Human captain and commanding officer of the Star Destroyer Ironhand of the Starfleet of the Imperial Remnant some fifteen years after the Battle of Endor.\nHe was one of four Braxant Sector Fleet officers whose Star Destroyers were chosen to serve Flim, a con-artist portraying a returned Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the plans of Moff Vilim Disra and Royal Guardsman Grodin Tierce to envelope the New Republic into a civil war over the crisis concerning the revealed Caamas Document. In order to convince Argona and his fellow officers—captains Nalgol of the Tyrannic, Trazzen of the Obliterator, and Dorja of the Relentless—that Flim was Thrawn, Disra had a meeting executed where the four captains personally met with the Thrawn-apparent. Of the four Star Destroyers, the Tyrannic, Obliterator, and Ironhand were chosen to lead a assault on the Bothan homeworld of Bothawui, in which the assault was foiled and the Star Destroyers were forced to withdraw.",
