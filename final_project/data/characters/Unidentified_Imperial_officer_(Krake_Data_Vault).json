 "content": "An Imperial officer was a Human female serving at the Imperial installation known as the Krake Data Vault on Krake's Planet. The officer commanded the data vault's security center and was berating an underling for a dusty computer console when Luke Skywalker used Force persuasion to make her order the vault's energy shield turned off to allow Skywalker to rescue Chewbacca with the Millennium Falcon. Following the rescue, the officer came to her senses and had the shield reactivated, which trapped the Falcon inside. To escape the installation and its energy shield, Skywalker used the deflector shields of the Falcon to cause an explosion of the vault power generators. Skywalker's actions resulted in a massive explosion that destroyed the vault, killing the female officer and everyone else inside.\nA Human female, the officer had short, curly black hair, fair skin, and blue eyes. She appeared to be a strict and efficient commanding officer, and was susceptible to Luke Skywalker's Force persuasion ability when he manipulated her from a distance.",
