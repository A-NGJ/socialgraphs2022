 "content": "Bogg was a Geonosian engineer who designed and operated the landtank known as the Bogg Behemoth. Bogg was captured and imprisoned by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and the 501st Legion of the Galactic Republic, on the planet Makem Te during a land battle before the Geonosian could use his weapon against the Swokes Swokes city of Thousand Thousand. Bogg's last surviving creation, the Venomator, eventually found it's way onto the black market and was eventually obtained by Quarren outlaw Clawfish. It was eventually destroyed.\nBogg first appeared in the 17th issue of the 6th volume of the Star Wars Comic UK comic line, published by Titan Magazines on February 10, 2011.",
