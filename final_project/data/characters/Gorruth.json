After the two Wookiee co-owners of the Service were murdered by the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar, Gorruth was part of the security team that discovered their bodies. He told the Service's administrative department to stop any starships from landing or taking off from Artom Station, until someone official could be sent to investigate the murders.",
