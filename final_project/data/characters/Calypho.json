 "content": "Lord Calypho was a Sith Lord of the Sith Empire and the Sith Master of Darth Thanaton. According to the Dark Council, Calypho overstepped his bounds and sought power he had not earned, causing him to be arrested.\nCalypho was kept imprisoned in the Council headquarters in Dromund Kaas. As a test, Calypho's apprentice was forced to fight against his former Master, defeating him before the eyes of Darth Marr, Darth Vowrawn and a third Councilor. However, Calypho was spared by the Council for further use. The Council sought to torture Calypho close to death so the Sith Master would experience visions of the future.\nCalypho taught that foresight grew stronger and clearer as death drew near. Through fasting and meditation he sought to achieve clairvoyance.",
