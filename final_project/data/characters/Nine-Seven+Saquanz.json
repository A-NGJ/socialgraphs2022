 "content": "Nine-Seven Saquanz, or 9-7 Saquanz was a male Quarren who served Fyzen Gor's Brotherhood of Wire and Bone on the moon Grava in 7 ABY. He was barely recognizable as a Quarren, as three of his facial tentacles had been torn off and the remaining one was shredded to just a wisp of cartilage. Additionally constellations of small, suppurating abrasions lined the skin around his pale-blue eyes.\nBraket Twelve-Twelve and he were the first to encounter Han Solo and Lando Calrissian when they arrived on Grava to find former Imperial Admiral Ruas Fastent. They asked them to hand over their weapons, but as the two smugglers refused to do so, several members of the cult emerged from the bushes including Balthamus.",
