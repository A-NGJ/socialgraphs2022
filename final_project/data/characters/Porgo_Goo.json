 "content": "Porgo Goo was a short, plump, furry native of Chortose.\nPorgo ran a small repairs shop in the Minos Cluster with his brothers, who all had natural ability for engineering and repairing starships. None of them had the technical understanding to back up their practical ability but the Goo brothers were not embarrassed by this. The Goo brothers charged the standard rate for their work, but if properly motivated , could complete their work in a third of the usual time needed. The Goo brothers were also perfectly willing to install illegal ship modifications so long as they viewed the modification as being 'cool'.\nPorgo was a playful being and enjoyed social gatherings, especially in dangerous cantinas. Above all else however he loved to fix things that needed fixing.",
