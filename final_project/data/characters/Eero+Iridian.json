 "content": "Eero Iridian was a friend of Count Dooku's during his years at the Jedi Temple, and he aspired to be a senator in the Galactic Republic. Though he ran twice for senator, he never managed to gain any political success. Eero eventually betrayed his old Jedi friend during a plot with Lorian Nod to kidnap several senators, including Blix Annon, but Dooku and his Padawan, Qui-Gon Jinn, managed to capture the conspirators and return them to Coruscant to stand trial.\nEero didn't know it, but he was a pawn in a plot formulated by the Sith Lord, Darth Tenebrous, who wished to have him replace Senator Annon.",
