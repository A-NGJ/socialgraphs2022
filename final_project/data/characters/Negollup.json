 "content": "Negollup, nicknamed \"Scrapper\", was a male Aqualish Bounty hunter. During the Galactic Civil War, he was part of a gang led by Zinn Classet charged with hunting down Alliance to Restore the Republic operatives who had freed a Wookiee slave by the authorities of the Spice Mines of Kessel. He wore an orange spacesuit with brown boots and vest, and wore his weapons openly on his belt. Negollup was a typical Aqualish; abrasive and eager to fight.",
