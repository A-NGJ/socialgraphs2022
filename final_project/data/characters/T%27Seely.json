 "content": "T'Seely was a male Hasikian Jedi Knight serving the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the last decades of the Republic Classic era.\nAs a Force-sensitive, T'Seely joined the Jedi Temple's academy, where he began training in the ways of the Force. Stationed at the Temple at the start of the Clone Wars, a conflict which erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, T'Seely was assigned to pilot a shuttle to carry Grand Master Yoda to the Republic Executive Building to conduct a meeting with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan concerning the state of affairs in the war-torn Republic. T'Seely was concerned for the safety of Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Knight Anakin Skywalker, as he had heard many rumors floating around the Temple as to who survived the costly battle on Geonosis.\nSometime later, around the time of the Fall of Falleen, T'Seely was knighted in an attempt to bring more Knights into the war effort. Ascending to the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic, T'Seely was stationed at the Temple and assigned as an aide to Communications Chief Ban-yaro in the Temple's comm center. While there, the Hasikian received an urgent message sent by Senator Organa for Master Kenobi, and relayed it to the Jedi Master in the Situation Room.",
