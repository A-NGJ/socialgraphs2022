 "content": "Pok was a Twi'lek male who was a part of the Free Ryloth Movement during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Eight years after the start of the Clone Wars, Pok led a team which hijacked and stole an Imperial transport carrying weapons from the Yaga Minor shipyards. Pok and his team attempted to outrun their Imperial pursuers and to rendezvous with Cham Syndulla, the leader of the Free Ryloth movement. However, Darth Vader caught up with Pok's team and boarded their freighter. He then proceeded to kill Pok's entire party before Force choking Pok to death. Pok's death was heard over the com by Cham and his lieutenant Isval, who decided to accelerate their rebellion against the Empire.",
