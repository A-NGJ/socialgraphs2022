 "content": "Silas Tagge was a human male scientist who served as Head of Weapons Development at the Tagge Corporation during the Galactic Civil War. A member of the House of Tagge, he was an older brother of Domina Tagge, who chaired the company. Like their brother Orman, Silas coveted the leadership over the family company. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, his jealousy ultimately prompted him to hire the bounty hunter Boushh and his crew, using the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate as a proxy, to assassinate the other members of the Tagge Corporation's Executive Board during a meeting aboard the company's flagship, the Acquisitor. The plan, however, backfired, and the scientist was killed by his sister instead.\nSilas Tagge first appeared through imagination in the current Star Wars canon in the fifth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, which was written by Alyssa Wong, illustrated by Marika Cresta, and published by Marvel Comics on October 28, 2020. He was later identified in War of the Bounty Hunters – Boushh 1, a one-shot comic issue tying into the crossover event Star Wars: War of the Bounty Hunters also written by Wong, illustrated by David Baldeón, and published by Marvel on September 15, 2021. Silas Tagge was originally introduced in the Star Wars Legends continuity in the thirty-first issue of the comic series Star Wars, written by Archie Goodwin, illustrated by Carmine Infantino, and first published by Marvel Comics on October 2, 1979.",
