She was also the sister of Jabe Calwell.\nAt the age of nine Kallie was entrusted to take care of the Calwell family dewbacks.\nIn 19 BBY Kallie was still working with her family's dewbacks. While on a dewback named Snit the animal stampeded and headed towards the Rumbles which contained one of Tatooine's sarlaccs.\nHer mother Annileen attempted a rescue. This was when Obi-Wan Kenobi appeared to help the teenager before they fell into the pit of the sarlacc.\nKenobi saved Kallie and Annileen but the dewback Snit was killed by the sarlacc. Annileen who had been knocked out when Kenobi threw her off the back of the dewback with the Force and told Kallie that the money to replace the dewback would come out of her wages.\nAfter the incident Kallie told stories of the event to others at the Pika Oasis.\nThree days later Kenobi visited the Oasis to buy feed for his eopie, Rooh. Kallie was tasked to collect the feed while her mother took Kenobi on a tour of the store. When Kallie reentered the building she attacked Veeka Gault and later followed her mother to watch Kenobi leave.\nShe later attended the Comet Run Podrace at Mos Espa.",
