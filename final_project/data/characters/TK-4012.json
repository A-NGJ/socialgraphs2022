 "content": "TK-4012 was the designation of a female stormtrooper who served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Army. In the year 0 BBY, she was stationed on the planet Scarif, where the Empire's Citadel Tower was located. When the Alliance to Restore the Republic attacked Imperial forces in the Battle of Scarif, TK-4012 was one of several stormtroopers who confronted the rebel KX-series security droid K-2SO while he operated a console in order to aid his fellow rebels in recovering the Death Star plans from the tower's vault. During the shoot out with the droid, she fired a blaster bolt that impacted just over four centimeters from his programming process access door. Despite being able to visually identify TK-4012, K-2SO resisted the urge to download her personnel file and prepared for his inevitable fate, sending one last message to his friends and destroying the console before being destroyed himself. TK-4012 herself died soon after when the Empire's Death Star superweapon fired on Citadel Tower.\nTK-4012 first appeared in the novelisation of the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was written by Alexander Freed and released on December 16, 2016. While it is possible that TK-4012 appears in the film itself there is no way to specifically identify any stormtrooper in the relevant scene as her. As such this article makes no assumption about whether she appears in the film or not.",
