 "content": "Massimo Tagge was a male member of the influential Tagge family who served the Galactic Empire as a Chief Instructor at the Empire's Military Academy on the planet Carida. During his tenure, he discovered the gifted stormtrooper cadet Natasi Daala and transferred her to his own officer-cadet program, from that of Instructor Visk. Daala produced a number of tactical analysis papers on the subject of the Tarkin Doctrine, a methodology for maintaining order that was developed by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, and Tagge forwarded copies of the documents to his cousin, Cassio Tagge.",
