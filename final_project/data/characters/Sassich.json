 "content": "Sassich was a Human woman from Corellia. She was a member of CorSec, and became its director at the age of forty, a great achievement. However, it came due to a huge commitment to her work that resulted in a mid-life crisis that included her divorcing her husband, getting personal training lessons from twins half her age, and buying a red ZRX-29 airspeeder.",
