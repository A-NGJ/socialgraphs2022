 "content": "Nif Sarjun was a male Nautolan who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A blue-skinned Nautolan with large black eyes and a fluent speaker of Nautila, Sarjun was a resident of the city of Anchorhead. In 3643 BBY, he had a shop in the city's market where he sold crystals, weapon modifications, hilts, and other relics.\nNif Sarjun was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears in Anchorhead, the Republic-only city on Tatooine, as an Artifice Crew Skill Vendor. In the game, Sarjun's voice actor speaks the generic alien language that many species in The Old Republic speak, but it is assumed that Sarjun speaks Nautila because he is a Nautolan. Sarjun is also mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, released by Prima Games.",
