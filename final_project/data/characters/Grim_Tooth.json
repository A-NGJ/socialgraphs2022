 "content": "Grim Tooth was a rancor kept in a containment cell at the Sanctuary research complex on the planet Makeb. During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY, Grim Tooth was killed.\nGrim Tooth appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Makeb. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of an achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
