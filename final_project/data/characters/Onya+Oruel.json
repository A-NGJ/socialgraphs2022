 "content": "Onya Oruel was a female Human living on Tatooine along with her sister during the Cold War. In 3643 BBY she was kidnapped by the Twin Suns slavers on her sister's moisture farm and taken to Anchorhead Spaceport along with other prisoners. The prisoners were held there for a week, however before they could be transferred off-world, an off-worlder hired by Anchorhead sheriff Encot stormed the room the prisoners were held in and killed the pirates, allowing the captives to escape. Onya Oruel later wrote a letter of thanks to her rescuer.\nOnya Oruel appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as one of the unnamed prisoners during the mission \"Smuggler's Route\" on Tatooine. She is later identified by name in the letter she sends and although the letter does not specify her species, all prisoners freed during the mission are Human females.",
