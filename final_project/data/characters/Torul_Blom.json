 "content": "Torul Blom was a male Pau'an politician who served as governor of Pau City on Utapau during the Clone Wars.\nWhen Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to Utapau to investigate the death of Master Tu-Anh, Blom met them to inform that their presence had upset Pau City citizens, as well as deny the Confederacy of Independent Systems presence on the planet.\nIt was later revealed that the Pau'an was allied with the arms dealer Endente and Separatist Head of State Count Dooku. As he awaited his associate to come with the huge kyber crystall, he was informed of the arrival of Dooku's enforcer General Grievous. He was present when the Sugi came empty-handed in his office and witnessed him being beheaded by the General for his failure. When Kenobi and Skywalker returned to Pau City to ask him for help, Blom had them arrested and retrieved the crystal for the CIS.\nHis victory was short-lived as his men and B1-series battle droids were defeated and the two escaped. Grievous arrived a few moments after the duo had fled and seemed quite angered. Realizing his mistake, the Governor told him that he was sorry for the complication at which the cyborg stabbed him with a lightsaber, mocking that only now was he truly sorry.",
