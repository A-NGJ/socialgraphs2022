 "content": "A force-sensitive Muun female was the mother of Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. She was a disciple of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tenebrous. Which instructed her to seduce Caar Damask of the InterGalactic Banking Clan and carry his child. According to the plan, she became Damask's codicil wife and bore him a son, Hego Damask, which she raised with great care. After Hego murdered one of his playmates, she made him state his feelings on the death of the youngling, before telling him that he had the same \"gift\" she and his father had.\nJust before Hego was handed over to Tenebrous to become his Sith apprentice, Plagueis' mother told the young Muun that in some ways and ways that he would eventually come to understand, the young child belonged to Tenebrous. Later, Hego's mother disappeared without a trace.\nDarth Plagueis' mother was first mentioned in the 2012 novel Darth Plagueis, written by James Luceno.",
