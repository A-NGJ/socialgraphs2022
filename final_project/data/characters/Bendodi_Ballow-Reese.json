 "content": "Bendodi Ballow-Reese was the eldest member of the crew stationed on the research outpost ExGal-4 on Belkadan in 25 ABY. He had been a soldier for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nBendodi was one of four scientists that went on an expedition to scout out a large storm on the planet. As they approached it, the atmosphere, affected by the infiltrator Yomin Carr's dweebits, became increasingly toxic. The expedition had trouble returning to the base after discovering the storm, due to low oxygen rations. Realizing that not all of the team would be able to return to the base, Bendodi gave his oxygen pack to Jerem Cadmir before escaping into the jungle to die. Luther De'Ono, a friend of Bendodi, followed to beg him to not commit suicide, only to be shot by Bendodi. Moments later, Bendodi shot himself.",
