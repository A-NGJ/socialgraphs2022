 "content": "Pieter was a male Ming Po who served as Chieftain of Ming Po Town on the planet Carlac. During the Clone Wars he tried to remain neutral, but the Mandalorian Death Watch group made a base on Carlac and began bullying and kidnapping villagers from Pieter's town, greatly angering him. In an attempt to save his people, Pieter confronted Pre Vizsla, the leader of the Death Watch. Vizsla attempted to kill Pieter for his insolence, but the Chieftain's granddaughter Tryla sacrificed herself to save her grandfather. The Mandalorians then set the Ming Po town ablaze, but the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and her friend Lux Bonteri saved Pieter and his people.\nPieter first appeared in \"A Friend in Need,\" the fourteenth episode of the fourth season of the Star Wars The Clone Wars television series. He was voiced by Phil LaMarr.\nHis name was inspired by the character Piter De Vries from the Dune franchise.\nIn the very first draft of the script for the episode \"A Friend In Need,\" the alien village was to be made up of Yarkorans, which were spelled \"Yakoran\" in some pieces of concept art. The villagers were made to be sympathetic and relatable, and they were replaced with the Ming Po people.",
