 "content": "Hannevik was a human individual who served as an officer in the Galactic Empire. Alongside Beldin and Ellian Zahra, Hannevik received instruction from Governor Wilhuff Tarkin while rising through the Imperial Academy, having originally been selected by Tarkin due to a lack of other ties. Sometime after they graduated and entered into Imperial service, Beldin, Hannevik, and Zahra were taken to the Carrion Plateau on Eriadu, where Tarkin wished to test his three protégés in order to determine a successful candidate. Tarkin had the three officers hunt an albino veermok, also intending for them to fight each other in the process. Zahra killed the veermok and defeated both Beldin and Hannevik, successfully becoming Tarkin's protégé.",
