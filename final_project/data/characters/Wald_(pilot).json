 "content": "Wald was a Rebel Alliance pilot stationed at the Salvation base on the planet Arbra, shortly after the Battle of Hoth. He flew a T-65 X-wing starfighter and served under the command of Luke Skywalker.\nWald was a male Human with long, wavy brown hair. He wore spectacles and had a full mustache and beard. He wore the standard-issue X-wing flight suit and carried a BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle.\nWald was part of an excursion that followed fellow pilot Shira Brie to the planet Shalyvane. Shira told the other members of her squad that Shalyvane was her home world and that a tribe of alien nomads known as the Em'liy had been conducting raids on the village of Chinshassa. The pilots disembarked from their fighters and engaged the Em'liy at the Circle of Kavaan. With the help of Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, the pilots succeeded in driving the opposing forces away.\nIt wasn't until later that Wald and the others learned that their fellow pilot, Shira Brie, was in fact an Imperial spy, conspiring with Darth Vader to calculate the coordinates to the new Rebel base at Arbra.\nThe character of Wald was created by Marvel Comics writers, David Michelinie and Walt Simonson and bears a marked resemblance to Simonson.\nAlthough other Rebel pilots from issues of the Marvel run set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi have been retconned into being members of Rogue Squadron, Wald has never been identified as a Rogue.",
