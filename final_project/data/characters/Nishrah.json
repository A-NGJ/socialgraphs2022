 "content": "Nishrah was a female Human slaver who was active around 185 BBY. In this year she traveled to the planet of Kashyyyk with fellow slavers Twool and Lix, hoping to capture a number of Wookiee younglings to sell. The group landed in the Shadowlands, the forest floor of Kashyyyk, where they encountered a group of young Wookiees led by Chewbacca. Hoping to catch the young group the slavers attacked, but were eventually beaten by the group. Twool and Nishrah were captured when adult Wookiees arrived in the Shadowlands and Lix was killed while trying to escape.",
