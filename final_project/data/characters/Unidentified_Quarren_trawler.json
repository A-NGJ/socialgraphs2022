 "content": "A Quarren trawler worked on the ice planet Pagodon and harassed a Mythrol in a public house there alongside two other trawlers. The trawlers planned to cut off the Mythrol's gills and sell them, but before they could, the bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian entered the bar and distracted them. The lead trawler then declared the Mandalorian had spilt his drink, and when the bounty hunter ignored him, the trio of trawlers surrounded the Mandalorian. The hunter then quickly defeated the trio and killed the Quarren perpetrator, who attempted to flee.\nA Quarren worked as a trawler on the ice planet Pagodon following the collapse of the Galactic Empire. In around 9 ABY, the Quarren harassed a Mythrol in a public house at the settlement Ferryman's Reach on the planet alongside two human trawlers. The perpetrator held the Mythrol down on the table, while the trawler leader of the harassment noted that they could sell the Mythrol's gills at the nearby port. Though he attempted to surrender the credits he was carrying to the trio, the Mythrol was ignored, with the Quarren pulling him to his feet so the lead human could cut him with a knife.\nBefore the trawlers could cut the Mythrol, the bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian entered the bar, drawing the attention of the lead trawler. The Quarren kept hold of the Mythrol while the lead trawler approached the Mandalorian, claiming the bounty hunter had spilled his drink. When the Mandalorian ignored him, the lead trawler signaled over the Quarren and the other human trawler.\nThe Quarren dropped the Mythrol onto the table before approaching the bar, with the intention of surrounding the Mandalorian. The establishment's bartender offered the trawler a replacement drink for free, but when he slid the drink toward the human, the Mandalorian caught it mid slid and threw the contents in the Quarren's face. This caused the trawler to stumble back while the Mandalorian smashed the empty mug over the head of the second human trawler, before grabbing hold of and slamming the head of the Quarren into the bar. Though the lead trawler then attempted to stab the Mandalorian, the bounty hunter blocked the knife, redirecting it into the trawler's own back.\nWith the Quarren's comrades defeated, the trawler attempted to flee but was caught by the bounty hunter's whipcord launcher as it passed through the bar's door and fell to the ground. As the hunter pulled the Quarren back through the door, the trawler pulled out a blaster pistol and fired at the him, though the shot was deflected by his Mandalorian armor. The hunter then shot the door control with his own blaster, causing it to close on the Quarren, who proceeded to be sliced in half and died.\nWith orange skin and green eyes, the Quarren attempted to flee from the Mandalorian after seeing the other trawlers beaten.\nThe Quarren carried a blaster pistol and wore a brown jacket over a black shirt, as well as black pants and boots.\nThe Quarren trawler was portrayed by Dmitrious Bistrevsky in Chapter 1 of the 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, which aired on November 12, 2019.",
