 "content": "Al, known as Big Al, was a male human who resided on the Colossus refueling station on Castilon in the later stages of the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance. He sported a bushy mustache and was a regular at Aunt Z's tavern.\nWhen a brawl ensued during Kazuda Xiono's game of darts against Grevel, Al was the only bar patron who did not join in the fight but kept on drinking instead. The next day, before the race between Kazuda and Torra Doza, Al was already waiting outside Aunt Z's Tavern before Aunt Z opened its door. When Kaz found himself in a precarious situation on the outside ledges of Doza Tower, his plight was clearly visible from Aunt Z's Tavern. Al bet 50 credits that Kazuda would fall off.\nAl was a male human with gray hair and light skin.\nAl is a character created and developed for Star Wars Resistance. He is voiced by Jonathan Lipow.",
