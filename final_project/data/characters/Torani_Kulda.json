 "content": "Torani Kulda of the Virulli Clan was a female Rodian bounty hunter and assassin who operated during the years of the Galactic Empire.\nSmall and lithe, even for a Rodian, Kulda exuded calm confidence and open disdain for anyone she considered to be beneath her notice. She possessed light green skin and golden eyes. A prominent trio of scars, which she made no attempt to conceal, crossed her brow. She was considered a devious foe and often worked in tandem with her partner, the Rodian assassin droid A0-2, to overcome their foes. She flew a M12-L Kimogila heavy fighter.",
