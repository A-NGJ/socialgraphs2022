 "content": "Nikollane was a Human female who lived on Telerath in the city of Noua and worked in the place called \"Ember's Fire\". In 19 BBY her son, Dado, lost an arm in an accident and she was unable to get proper medical aid, until a former Jedi Dass Jennir used the Force to ease the boy's pain. She thanked him for saving the boy's life earlier, as well as for treating the injury.\nAfter Jennir rid the Telerath of the warring gangs, his former companions from the ship Uhumele came to the planet in search of him. Nikollane served them drinks on Ember's Fire while Fish, the former water taxi guide of Jennir, told the crew of Uhemele Jennir's destination.",
