 "content": "Merumeru was a male Wookiee chieftain and captain from the planet Kashyyyk. In the last days of the Clone Wars, he led a group of Wookiee warriors into battle against the Confederacy of Independent Systems on his homeworld. Merumeru and his warriors fought on the beaches beneath the city of Kachirho against the Separatist Droid Army and alongside clone troopers of the Galactic Republic. Shortly after the battle, the Republic forces turned on the Wookiees during Order 66.\nMerumeru was a brown-furred, 2.25-meter-tall Wookiee. He and his men were valiant fighters.\nAs a chieftain, Merumeru wielded a wooden command staff. During the Battle of Kashyyyk, he wore a helmet, ornamented pauldrons, and a harness.\nMerumeru was portrayed by actor Axel Dench in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith but identified only as \"Wookiee Chieftain\" during production. He was named in the Star Wars Legends reference book Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by James Luceno and released in 2005. The name was made canon by the reference book Ultimate Star Wars, which was released in 2015.\nThe helmet Merumeru wore in Revenge of the Sith wasn't completed in time for production, so he wore a blue helmet. The blue headgear was later replaced with a digital helmet in the final version of the film.",
