 "content": "Scholar Szingo was a member of the Sanyassan Marauders who resided in Terak's Keep on the forest moon of Endor. He had bitter feelings of rivalry with the Nightsister Charal, the cohort of King Terak.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Szingo paid an individual 75 credits to take care of three pirates and their leader to get his disintegration weapon. Soon after this, he discovered that Charal had sent some Marauders under her command to raid the pirate's crashed ship, ensuring that Szingo could not find anything else. This angered Szingo, who ordered the individual to kill the Marauders who had performed this act. Upon doing so, he rewarded the individual with 150 credits. But Charal convinced King Terak that she had nothing to do with the attack, so Szingo hired the individual one last time. This time he was to eliminate an Arachne which had been attacking the Marauders outposts as a way to be forgiven. Once this was done, Szingo rewarded the individual with 350 credits.\nSzingo was a non-player character  in Star Wars Galaxies, which gave quests to players as part of the \"Marauder Themepark.\"",
