 "content": "Hap Brehg was a male Neimoidian who lived in the last decades of the Galactic Republic, during which he served in the Trade Federation.\nHap Brehg was born with a common Neimoidian last name. In 32 BBY, Brehg became a member of the Federation's Occupation Council during the Invasion of Naboo. He held the title of Treasurer.\nDuring the Battle of Naboo, Brehg and the other members of the Occupation Council took refuge in the throne room. However, Queen Amidala and Quarsh Panaka managed to enter the throne room and capture Brehg, along with Viceroy Gunray and the other Neimoidians present. He was taken to Coruscant to await trial for his crimes.\nBrehg was a male Neimoidian with mottled grey skin. He wore an outfit composed of different shades of brown fabrics. The overall outfit resembled Viff Almay's robe but with two stripes on each of the sleeves.\nHap Brehg was identified in the Star Wars Insider 147 Rogues Gallery article \"The Devious Neimoidians Revealed.\" According to the notes for the article, found on the Facebook Page \"Star Wars Sourcebooks,\" his last name was derived from Brehg, a Neimoidian character from the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
