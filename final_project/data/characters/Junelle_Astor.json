 "content": "Junelle Astor was the Human female aid to Governor Ian Lago during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nJunelle Astor appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Junelle Astor would have been on Naboo as a preclude to additional quests given by Ian Lago. However, Astor is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
