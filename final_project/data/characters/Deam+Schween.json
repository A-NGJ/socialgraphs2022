 "content": "Deam Schween was a male Rodian, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nSchween worked in the Chasm, a cantina that was located in the city of Gadrin, where he was employed as a comedian. He typically used insult comedy and would mock people to make the cantina's patrons laugh. He was present when the cantina was attacked by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun and the following day, he told the heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who were investigating the incident, about what had happened.",
