 "content": "Tiplee was a red-skinned Mikkian female Jedi Master who, along with her twin sister, Tiplar, served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Tiplee and her sister were commissioned as Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic, and the two fought in the Battle of Ringo Vinda. During the campaign, Tiplar was murdered by clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup,\" after a malfunction in the clone's behavioral modification biochip that triggered a premature activation of Clone Protocol 66, a Sith-implanted command that forced clones to kill Jedi as traitors. Tiplee was present at the time and watched her sister die.\nThe death of Tiplar pushed her to increase the power of her aggressive tactics. Later in the war, Tiplee was part of the Jedi team investigating the aftermath of a battle between the forces of Darth Maul, leader of the criminal army known as the Shadow Collective, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Ord Mantell. Along with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Tiplee led an assault on Vizsla Keep 09, a Mandalorian supply outpost, where Maul was hiding. During the fight, Tiplee was killed by Count Dooku, leader of the Separatists, who had formed an alliance with Maul.\nTiplee was a member of the Jedi Order along with her twin sister, Tiplar, and both sisters eventually achieved the rank of Jedi Master. By the Clone Wars, Tiplee and her sister were active enemies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and they both served as Jedi Generals within the Grand Army of the Republic during the war. Fighting against the Separatists' forces, both of them were accomplished leaders in the Republic Military, and Tiplee and Tiplar occasionally served alongside each other, including during the Republic campaign at the planet Ringo Vinda, where they fought alongside the unit of clone troopers led by Clone Commander \"Doom\" as part of the force directed to take an orbital space station from the Confederacy. Along with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, the two Jedi sisters led the clone troopers under their command against the battle droid forces of Admiral Trench. After several encounters, the Republic forces reached the station's communication center and captured it.\nWhile preparing to conquer the command center, clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup,\" underwent an unexpected malfunction in a secret organic chip within his head; the chip, clandestinely implanted in all clones by the Sith during the cloning process, initiated Clone Protocol 66 sooner than the Sith intended, causing Tup to face mental lapses that left him agitated and confused. While in a trance, in which the protocol's command to kill Jedi as traitors was activated, he sneaked up behind Tiplar and shot her to death. Tiplee watched as her sister was murdered, and Tiplar's death stalled the Republic momentum. The Jedi and Republic forces quickly apprehended Tup and retreated with him and Tiplar's body further back into the station.\nUpon their return to their base, Tiplee mourned her sister while Skywalker interrogated Tup. Tiplee arrived to observe the interrogation, and Tup, still feeling the effects of the chip's malfunction, tried to attack her, despite being restrained. Tiplee quickly stopped him by using the Force to levitate him and hold Tup against the wall until he calmed down. She showed anger towards the clone, but Skywalker was able to help her control her emotions and convinced her to release Tup. Tiplee was later present in a medical bay where Tup was examined, and the clone stated that he did not remember killing Tiplar. The cause of Tup's motivation to murder Tiplar remained unclear, though Tiplee and the others suspected that the Separatists may have somehow developed an anti-clone virus. With no clear answers, Tup was sent to Kamino, the planet on which the clones were created, for examination. Tup died on Kamino, where his friend and fellow clone CT-5555 discovered the Sith plot and why Tiplar was murdered. CT-5555 was killed, however, before the Jedi and Tiplee could learn the truth about Order 66.\nHaving witnessed her sister's tragic murder, Tiplee decided to increase the power of her aggressive tactics. Later in the war, Tiplee was sent with fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and Aayla Secura to investigate the aftermath of a battle, fought between the Shadow Collective, a criminal army led by the rogue Sith Darth Maul, and Separatist forces, on the planet Ord Mantell. The Jedi deduced that Maul, who captured Separatist leaders Count Dooku and General Grievous on Ord Mantell, might have taken his prisoners to the nearby Vizsla Keep 09. Kenobi and Tiplee were sent to investigate the outpost and root out any Shadow Collective forces. While en route, Tiplee expressed concern that Kenobi would have difficulty keeping his emotions in check, as Maul had murdered Kenobi's close personal friend, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, but Kenobi assured her that he would be able to handle a confrontation with Maul.\nWhen their Republic attack cruiser arrived in the asteroid field surrounding the outpost, Kenobi and Tiplee departed with their forces, and their gunships encountered Gauntlet fighters from Death Watch, the warrior group that ruled Mandalore and a member of the Shadow Collective. The team fought their way through and attacked the outpost, where they fought off Death Watch resistance. Maul and Dooku, who had formed an alliance, soon joined the fight, leading to a lightsaber duel between the four Force-wielding combatants. The two Jedi were joined by Windu and Secura.\nDuring the fighting, Dooku used the Force to pull Tiplee toward him, stabbing her through the torso with his lightsaber and killing her. Meanwhile, Death Watch forces incapacitated Windu and Secura, allowing the two Sith Lords to escape. Kenobi was left to cradle Tiplee's body while he ordered the clones to pursue the fleeing Maul and Dooku.\nTiplee was a red-skinned, blue-eyed Mikkian female, with a blue tattoo that adorned her forehead. She was close with her equally-formidable sister, Tiplar, a fellow Jedi. Tiplee nearly lost control of her anger after Tiplar's death at Ringo Vinda, pinning clone trooper Tup against a wall using the Force. With Anakin Skywalker's help, Tiplee regained her control, despite still mourning her sister's death. Her tragic death pushed Tiplee to increase the strength of her aggressive tactics. Tiplee later expressed similar concern to Obi-Wan Kenobi, wondering if he would be able to confront Darth Maul, Duchess Kryze's killer, without losing control of his own emotions.\nTiplee had a mastery of the Force and, as a result, attained the rank of Jedi Master. Tiplee, as well as Tiplar, demonstrated her power during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, when the twin sisters used the Force to push shielded droidekas off their footing to allow clone troopers to destroy them. Tiplee, who wielded a blue blade, was proficient with a lightsaber, demonstrating those abilities on Ringo Vinda and the assault on the Mandalorian asteroid outpost. Her abilities were not a match for Count Dooku, however, who killed her with a lightsaber after using the Force to pull her toward him.\nTiplee wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber in combat. Her apparel consisted of a full-body outfit, boots, and a headpiece.\nTiplee first appeared in \"The Unknown,\" the first episode of The Lost Missions, the sixth season of the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Both Tiplee and her twin sister, Tiplar, were voiced by Anna Graves. The appearance of both sisters was based on a concept for an unused female Sith Lord designed by Iain McCaig for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Tiplee went on to appear in the comic book Darth Maulâ€”Son of Dathomir 3, released on July 16, 2014. The comic, written by Jeremy Barlow and drawn by Juan Frigeri, was based on scripts from unproduced episodes of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars series.\nTiplee's entry in the StarWars.com Databank incorrectly states that her and Obi-Wan Kenobi's mission to capture Darth Maul occurred at Ord Mantell, instead of at Vizsla Keep 09. Star Wars Jedi Pocket Expert mistakenly states that Tiplee was a Jedi Knight",
