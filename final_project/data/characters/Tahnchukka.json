 "content": "Tahnchukka, nicknamed Tank, was a one-eyed male Wookiee smuggler who was the companion of the bounty hunter Crovan Dane. In 22 BBY, he and Dane aided the Muun cyberneticist Bitt Panith by capturing a list of animals in the Shadowlands of the Mid Rim planet Kashyyyk for the scientist, so that he could create Krossen, a cyborg capable of resisting the Force.\nTheir efforts were, however, jeopardized by the Padawan of the Mon Calamari Jedi Master Bant Eerin and a Zabrak youngling, Jaylen Kos. The pair talked to the Toydarian mechanic Zaboshka, who claimed to have had knowledge about the whereabouts of Dane. In exchange for money, the technician led the two Jedi to a cantina, where the changeling Goomi was residing.\nTo date, Tahnchukka has only appeared in The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Way of the Jedi, a 2008 Decide Your Destiny novel by Jake Forbes and Sue Behrent. Given that the book is a Decide Your Destiny' role-playing adventure, Tahnchukka can appear in several possible story strands, and his actions are influenced by the reader's decisions. This article details the version in which he is featured for the longest time.\nThey, however, could not deliver the cargo due to the intervention of Jedi Master Bant Eerin's Padawan, the Jedi youngling Jaylen Kos and Sunchoo, a female Wookiee. Sunchoo distracted the two criminals, while the two Jedi released the beasts incarcerated in cages aboard Dane's starship. One of the beasts, a terentatek, killed Dane and chased Tahnchukka into the forest.",
