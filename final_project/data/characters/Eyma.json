 "content": "Eyma was a male Nautolan from Kachirho on Kashyyyk. He was a member of the Civilian Protection Guild. He was an enemy of the Ghrag Mercenaries and often sent out mercenaries to deal with them.\nEyma was involved in the recapture of a CR90 corvette in Kashyyyk space, that was stolen by the Ghrag during the Galactic Civil War in 1 ABY. He sent a group of spacers to recapture the corvette, and return it to orbit around the planet. The spacers were successful, and he awarded them with an Emperor's Royal Guard TIE/IN starfighter, an advanced X-wing starfighter, and a Black Sun Vaksai.\nEyma appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
