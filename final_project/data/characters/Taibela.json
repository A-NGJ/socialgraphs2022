 "content": "Taibela was a Human female who lived in on the desert planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Taibela resided in Mos Eisley with her fianc√© Oldksam. They were acquainted with the thugs Untas and Sleash.\nIn 1 ABY, Untas was indebted to the crime boss Faeto. When Faeto placed a death mark on him, Oldksam, Sleash and Untas went into hiding. Taibela stayed in Mos Eisley, where she was questioned by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter convinced her to reveal that Oldksam was hiding in the Krayt Cult Cave. After that, the bounty hunter found Oldksam, then Sleash, and finally killed Untas.\nTaibela was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Taibela was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
