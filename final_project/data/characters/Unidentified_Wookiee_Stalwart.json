 "content": "A Wookiee male individual served in Ne'eda's Stalwarts, the organization of the crime lord Ne'eda Frip, on Neral's moon. When the smuggler Lando Calrissian, who owed a debt to Frip, visited the moon, the Wookiee Stalwart brought him to Frip. Calrissian managed to escape punishment for failing to pay his debt by falsely promising to give Frip a valuable artifact he possessed, and Frip sent the Wookiee with Calrissian to view the cargo in his starship, the Millennium Falcon. However, before they could reach the ship, Calrissian was confronted by bounty hunters working for Jeskian Veldar, who entered into an argument with the Wookiee. While the Stalwart argued with the hunters, Calrissian escaped.",
