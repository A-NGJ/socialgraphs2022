 "content": "Ro Thran was a Gran male who worked as a hunter for hire. At one point, he captured a bull krykna for the Tyn Syndicate. He was later one of several hunters hired by the archeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, who had been swallowed alive by the Shadowfang Beast guarding a temple on the world of X3-299-11, prior to 3 ABY. Aphra wanted a hunter to subdue the beast then kill it so she could escape its stomach; however, Thran was killed when he activated one of the temple's traps that launched several spears into the Gran and pinned him to a wall. The hunters Nokk and Winloss later discovered Thran's body, but Aphra claimed he must have been hired by someone else to capture the beast. Thran had black eyes and pink skin. He wore red armor over a black shirt and blue pants at the time of his death.\nRo Thran appeared as a corpse in Doctor Aphra Annual 2, which was written by Simon Spurrier and released in 2018.",
