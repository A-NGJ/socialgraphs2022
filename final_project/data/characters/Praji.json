 "content": "Praji was a male human who served as a commander in the Imperial military. In 0 BBY, he served on the Devastator, Darth Vader's flagship, where he was tasked with capturing R2-D2 and C-3PO on Tatooine.\nPraji was played uncredited by George Roubicek in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the Star Wars original trilogy. Praji's lines, however, were dubbed by an American actor, so Praji's voice didn't at all resemble Roubicek's. In Star Wars Legends, the character's first name was established as \"Nahdonnis.\"\nPraji's appearance was in the Tantive IV sequence shot over three days in July 1976 at the virtual end of Episode IV's principal photography, on the Tantive IV main corridor set erected on Stage 9 of Elstree Studios, just at the north of London. Praji was adressed as \"Second Officer\" in the revised fourth draft script of A New Hope, in which Vader orders fellow officer Daine Jir rather than Praji to \"send a detachment down\", as shown in the Star Wars: Behind the Magic and Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays.\nDuring Celebration IV in May 2007, George Roubicek took part in a round-table discussion chaired by Scott Chernoff, in which he reminisced about his role. His fellow participants were Kenneth Colley , David Prowse , Barrie Holland , Richard LeParmentier , and Julian Glover . Their conversation was later published in Star Wars Insider 96.",
