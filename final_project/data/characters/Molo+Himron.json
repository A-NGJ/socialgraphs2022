 "content": "Major Molo Himron was a human male who served with the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire. He was also an Imperial Intelligence operative. Himron was handpicked by Emperor Palpatine himself for service in Intelligence for his skill, ruthlessness and calculating mind.\nHimron was considered the ideal Intelligence operative, with no recognizable traits and his ability to blend into any environment. He survived more combat and \"hard target\" situations than any other operative, and was totally loyal to the Galactic Empire\nHe survived the fragmentation of the Empire and joined Grand Admiral Thrawn's forces around 9 ABY.\nHimron was assigned to the Imperial Army and was leader of an assault force sent to Coruscant to capture Leia Organa Solo and her children.\nThe assault failed thanks to Mara Jade. Himron survived, though the doctors in the Palace's medical wing were unsure if he would ultimately survive.",
