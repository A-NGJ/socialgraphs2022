 "content": "Jorak was a member of the Sanyassan Marauders from the forest moon of Endor. During the Galactic Civil War, he paid an individual 25 credits to eliminate a bloodseeker mite which was attacking the Sanyassan's livestock. After this, he again paid the individual 30 credits to eliminate a blurrg which had eaten stinking verminweed, causing it to go into a fury and knock over trees, homes, and even children. Finally, he paid the individual 40 credits to take out a mantigrue, which earned them his respect.\nJorak appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011, as part of the Marauder Themepark.",
