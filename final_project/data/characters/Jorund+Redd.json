 "content": "Jorund Redd was a Human male who lived on the desert world Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Jorund Redd resided in Mos Eisley. The man had friends in the Rebel Alliance and was in contact with Droma Ordo in Anchorhead.\nIn 1 ABY, Redd and a woman named Escara Frei were caught in a fight between Lady Valarian's guards and Jabba the Hutt's thugs in Mos Eisley. The man got hit on his head very hard and started feeling very sick. A medic was sent by the 2-1B droid Billingsly to help Administrator Nillika and the the local medical staff. When the medic examined Redd and wanted to treat his wounds, thieves sent by Valarian's aide Kavas Urdano attacked the medic. The medic managed to kill both thieves and then treated Redd's injuries. Redd then suggested that the medic may contact Droma Ordo to work for the Alliance.\nJorund Redd was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jorund Redd was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nJorund Redd could be found in Mos Eisley as part of the low-level quest \"Caught in the Crossfire\", for players of the Medic profession. The player was given the mission by Billingsly, and only needed to talk to Redd in order to treat his wounds. As soon as his wounds were healed, two thief NPCs attacked the player, and a comm message from Kavas Urdano warned the player not to interfere with Valarian's business.",
