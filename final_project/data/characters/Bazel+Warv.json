 "content": "Bazel Warv, nicknamed Barv, was a Ramoan male from the planet of Ramoa, and a Jedi Knight in the New Jedi Order. He was good friends with fellow Jedi Yaqeel Saav'etu, Valin Horn, and Valin's sister Jysella. In 43.5 ABY, after both Horn siblings developed a psychosis, he and Saav'etu also developed the mysterious affliction. After being captured by the Jedi, he and Saav'etu, along with two other psychotic Knights, Seff Hellin and Natua Wan, were smuggled off Coruscant to Shedu Maad to escape their capture by Galactic Alliance Security.\nHe was killed defending the young Allana Solo during an ambush by the Lost Tribe dragging a Sith into the cannons of the Millennium Falcon.\nDuring the Yuuzhan Vong War Bazel Warv as a youngling was kept at Shelter, along with many other Jedi. Following the Second Galactic Civil War he was close friends with fellow Jedi Valin Horn, Yaqeel Saav'etu, and Jysella Horn. After Valin's descent into madness in 43.5 ABY, he comforted Jysella on the steps of the Jedi Temple and was one of the last people to see her before she also went insane.\nWhile at a tapcaf across from the Jedi Temple, Saav'etu and Warv witnessed Jysella Horn tossing civilians across the Processional Way. Rushing out to stop her, the two Jedi were attacked by Horn, who used flow-walking to predict their movements. After slashing Warv in the chest, Horn escaped, only to be captured by Galactic Alliance Security forces shortly after. Jedi Master Cilghal and several other Jedi rushed onto the scene, escorting Saav'etu and helping Warv back to the Temple for healing and debriefing. Sometime later, Leia Organa Solo attempted to have Warv escort her family during the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition. However, this proved impossible, as he was offworld at the time. After returning to Coruscant, Warv looked after Solo's adopted daughter Amelia while Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo visited the Jedi Temple Detention Center.\nLater, while strolling through the Fellowship Plaza on their way to the Jedi Temple, Warv and Saav'etu saw a camp of Security troopers and news reporters on the steps of the Temple. Not wanting to draw attention to themselves, the two Jedi headed for the private speeder entrance on the south side of the Temple. There, Warv realized that his Bothan companion had succumbed to the same illness that the Horns had, and attempted to get her inside to the Asylum Block. However, the presence of Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo slowed their process. Eventually, the Ramoan too contracted the strange psychosis, and he and Saav'etu were incapacitated with the help of Han and Leia Solo, with Warv landing atop Fel's limousine after being knocked out. As the Jedi hid Warv and Saav'etu in the Temple, a Galactic Alliance Security force arrived. Fel and Jaina managed to use Fel's diplomatic immunity to flee the scene, and as Jaina's parents went back inside the Temple and closed the gate behind them to buy some time. At some point Warv was injected with a sedative that caused a near fatal reaction.\nSoon after, Warv and Saav'etu, along with two other psychotic Jedi Knights, Seff Hellin and Natua Wan, were evacuated out of the Jedi Temple. The group escorting them, including Han Solo, Leia Solo, and Jedi Knights Jaden Korr and Avinoam Arelis, was attacked by Mandalorian Supercommandos. With the help of Warv, who demonstrated the ability to phase, they defeated the assailants. Warv still did not want to cooperate with the Jedi, but Raynar Thul was able to convince him to get into the FloatVan that took the psychotic Knights to safety. Thul pulled this off by promising that Saav'etu would not be harmed if Warv cooperated, Warv's steadfast loyalty did not permit him to abandon his friend. Later, the four psychotic Jedi were smuggled off of Coruscant to escape prosecution by the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. They were taken to Shedu Maad in the Hapes Cluster, where they would be out of reach of the Galactic Alliance.\nWarv was later killed while protecting Allana, sacrificing himself by dragging a Sith into the repeating fire of the Millennium Falcon's quadlasers. By then he only had one arm and had so many Lightsaber burns he was almost unrecognizable. He took at least 7 Sith with him when he died.\nIn the preview of Fate of the Jedi: Omen included in Fate of the Jedi: Outcast, Warv was identified as a Gamorrean. This was changed for Omen, however, in which he is identified as a Ramoan. Warv was killed off in the final novel of the series, Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse.",
