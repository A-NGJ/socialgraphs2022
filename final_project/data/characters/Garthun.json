 "content": "Garthun was a Trandoshan pilot who flew in the Rebel Alliance's Riot Squadron. Garthun was one of fellow pilot, Wyl Lark's first comrades in Riot Squadron during the Galactic Civil War. A few years prior to the battle at Chadawa, Garthun had taught Lark the words that could be used to raise morale before a battle, a blessing, in which the goddess may view their hunt with favor, and bless their tally.\nGarthun was first mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed.",
