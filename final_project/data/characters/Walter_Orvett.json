 "content": "Walter Orvett was a male Rodian courier who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, the boss of Walter Orvett hired the services of the R'dawc Bodyguard Agency to protect the Rodian courier during a delivery in Mos Eisley. A spacer working for Peawp R'dawc was therefore tasked to meet Orvett in the city and protect him at all costs. The spacer escorted Walter Orvett to the starport and effectively defended him during subsequent attacks.\nWalter Orvett was a non-player character appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Walter Orvett was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. He was involved in the quests given by Peawp R'dawc to beginner players who had chosen a \"brawler\" career. The \"brawler\" profession was later removed from the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005. Peawp R'dawc's questline was widely revamped and Walter Orvett was removed from these quests.",
