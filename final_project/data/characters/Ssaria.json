 "content": "Ssaria was a human female who served the Galactic Empire as a Moff and as the Governor of Castell's sector. Her tactics in enforcing the will of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, were seen as brutal by citizens on Castell, earning her a deadly reputation.\nSsaria was a female human who served in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. She rose to the rank of Moff and ruled as Governor of Castell's sector. She brutally enforced the will of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, and her tactics garnered her a reputation amongst the people of Castell. Some citizens took to calling her such nicknames as \"the Fiend of Castell\" and \"the Burning Moff.\"\nAt some point after the Battle of Yavin, Ssaria had an intimate relationship with Lando Calrissian. In her residence on Castell with Calrissian one day, he began admiring a small trinket, prompting her to inquire what he found so fascinating about it. Calrissian confessed he had planned to steal it, as a means of repaying his debts. Ssaria pulled out a blaster pistol and aimed it at him, as Calrissian continued on about how he couldn't steal it, knowing Ssaria would have troopers searching for him and that word of her lover's betrayal would get out. Calrissian convinced her to allow him to leave with the trinket, which he returned to Papa Toren shortly afterwards in an effort to repay his debt.\nSsaria was loyal to the Emperor and his rule over the galaxy, viewing herself as a tool to be wielded in order to carry out his will. Though her tactics were seen as brutal by people on Castell, she did not care about the reputation she gained as a result.",
