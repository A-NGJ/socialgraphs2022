 "content": "Wa-Vendeg was the name of a pet Skar'kla owned by Yarvok, a lieutenant of the Nova Blades pirates gang. Yarvok claimed to have brought up Wa-Vendeg himself, just like he did his other two Skar'kla, Rox and Yug. Krupo, a beast wrangler, lost Wa-Vendeg along with many of Yarvok's other pets after a ship holding the pets crashed on Dantooine, enraging Yarvok. Yarvok said he would kill Krupo if his lost pets, including Wa-Vendeg, were not located and returned as soon as possible because Yarvok feared for their safety.\nWa-Vendeg was mentioned in the Codex entry for Invasive Species on Dantooine in the 2019 expansion Onslaught to the 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic by the company BioWare.",
