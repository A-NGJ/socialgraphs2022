 "content": "CT-41/14-0301, otherwise known as Barr, was a clone trooper lieutenant in the Grand Army of the Republic who fought in the Clone Wars. He was the leader of the 2nd Platoon of the 327th Star Corps's Bacta Company, which he led in that battle. He had four squads under his commandâ€”a total of thirty-two men and four medics.\nEarly in the war the 327th attempted to reap information from the memory banks of a Confederate tactical droid, by setting up a trap in a rocky canyon. They were able to fabricate an information bunker, which attracted the attention of the droid. In turn, the droid ordered his troops to attack the bunker, prompting Barr and the men of the 327th to attack them from the rear. They were able to effectively dispatch the droid's troops, while Jedi General Aayla Secura beheaded the tactical droid. Since the droid had not gone into cyberostasis, they would be able to plunder its memory banks for intel.\nHe later fought in the Battle of Felucia and served with Galle and Bly. When Order 66 came, Barr helped the rest kill General Secura.",
