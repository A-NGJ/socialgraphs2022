 "content": "Ree Ohr was a Galactic Republic-affiliated female Human xenobiotics specialist active during the Clone Wars. In 20 BBY, she was stationed on the planet Drongar, the site of a battle between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She was responsible for coining the term \"orthostatic hypotensive syncope of idiopathic origin\" to describe an unusual malady that struck Republic clone trooper CT-914 during the battle; the condition caused him to faint every time he tried to stand up due to low blood pressure. Neither Ohr nor the rest of the Republic medical staff, however, could find a cause of the trooper's illness. CT-914 was hospitalized in the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7, where he was eventually healed by Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee with the Force.\nRee Ohr was mentioned in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, a novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004.",
