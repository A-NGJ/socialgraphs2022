 "content": "Lik Ankkit was a male Neimoidian. He lived in a villa on the planet Qiilura, where he controlled the production of barq and other luxury foods, exploiting the poor farmers who couldn't afford the food that grew on their fields.\nDuring the start of the Clone Wars, Ankkit hired the Mandalorian Ghez Hokan to enforce his dominance of the farmers. Hokan despised Ankkit, and thought of him as a \"weak and decadent grocer\".\nWhen the Mandalorian was put in command of a small force of battle droids to defend a vital facility, he used Ankkit's villa to hold some of his droids. The smashing of artifacts and scratching of floors by the droids was a great frustration to Ankkit.\nAnkkit appeared in the 2004 novel Republic Commando: Hard Contact by Karen Traviss. Traviss stated after the novel's release that she deliberately didn't say whether Lik Ankkit was killed in the novel or not, and that in her notes she had him as fleeing to lick his financial wounds.",
