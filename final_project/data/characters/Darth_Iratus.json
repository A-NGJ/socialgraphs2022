 "content": "Darth Iratus was a Human male Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire who was dead before the Cold War. He divided his time between Belsavis and Balmorra, performing a forbidden ritual on Belsavis that could heal a fractured body and keeping writings of this technique.\nIratus possessed too much power that rapidly decayed his body as a result of the Force-walking ritual. Though placing his power within holocrons was a temporary measure, Iratus sought out the Rakata Mother Machine on Belsavis to find a cure to his ailment. Unfortunately, he perished at the blasters of Rakatan guardian droids while attempting to gain access to the device.\nNonetheless, Iratus' holocrons came into the possession of Darth Thanaton, placed within his private library, which Lord Kallig broke into in order to find Iratus' journals for a similar problem.",
