 "content": "This female Human was married to a clone deserter from the planet Kamino and the mother of Connor Freeman. When the bounty hunter Jango Fett, also the clone army's genetic template, was hired by Count Dooku to track the deserter, Fett accepted the job and declined the additional information supplied by the Count. Fett cornered the deserter on his home on the planet Atzerri and then killed him, despite learning that the deserter was his own clone. Fett was about to leave when he encountered the deserter's wife, asking him to spare her and her infant son. Fett informed her that he wouldn't kill them since no one paid him to do so.",
