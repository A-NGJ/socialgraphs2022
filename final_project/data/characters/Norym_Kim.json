 "content": "Norym Kim was a Myke pirate that had conquered an entire sector near Imperial space by defeating rival pirate bands.\nKim used the money from his sector to fund Carnor Jax's plan to sabotage Palpatine's Clones. After the Emperor's death, Kim was offered a seat on Jax's Interim Ruling Council. Due to the fact he was a near-Human, he was accepted even by hardliner Humanocentrists.\nA very charismatic leader and a master of backroom political dealing, Kim became the head of the council after Burr Nolyds' death. However, Norym knew that the head of the council would be a natural target for whoever was assassinating the members of the council. With this knowledge, he convinced the other members of the council to make a dense bureaucrat, Xandel Carivus, the new head of the council.\nThis plan backfired when Carivus expelled and imprisoned the nonhuman members of the council after becoming the head of the council. Following Carivus' death, he was taken into New Republic custody.",
