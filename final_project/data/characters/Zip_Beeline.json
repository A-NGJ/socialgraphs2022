 "content": "Zip Beeline was the pseudonym of a Drall professional speeder racer on Coruscant. He then legally assumed the name after an impressive debut with good fan reaction. His speeders, swoops, and podracers were customized for his small stature. Touring widely, Zip ended his professional career at Boonta on Tatooine, when he caused a multi-speeder pileup during a championship race. Retiring in disgrace to Coruscant, Zip acquired newfound fame and notoriety in the illegal podraces, garbage pit races, and swoop rallies of the Undercity. Even in the illegal races, Zip was known as an honest competitor who never resorted to sabotage or cheating. He was known to post low times after indulging in Corellian lum.",
