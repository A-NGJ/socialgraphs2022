 "content": "Utric Sandov was a male Bothan spy who worked for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring the war against the Empire, Utric Sandov was a brown-haired male Bothan working as a spy for the Rebel Alliance at Ghost Base. In 0 ABY, he arranged a meeting with Princess Leia Organa to discuss information that could be vital to the Rebel Alliance. However, when the Galactic Empire's Strike Force Alpha invaded Ghost Base, Sandov had to flee to the island of Le'Roche. After Organa and the exiled Jedi Echuu Shen-Jon retook Ghost Base, Sandov contacted them from Le'Roche. He told them that the Empire had found the Vor'Na'Tu, an ancient and powerful Jedi artifact.\nUtric Sandov was voiced by Frank Welker in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. He appeared during the Leia Organa campaign, which was later included in the game's 2002 expansion pack Clone Campaigns.",
