 "content": "Borun Call was an infamous Quarren slaver active since the days of the Old Republic. He was responsible for introducing Slar-dan ti Gardi to the slave trade. When Gardi was briefly captured by Tauran Nartal, Call rescued his former partner and captured Nartal in the process. Call also aided the Galactic Empire in enslaving the Talz of Alzoc III.\nCall grew up in Sar Galva on Calamari. Arrested and imprisoned, he used his natural skills at leadership to be appointed to labor crew coordinator and develop as a slaver. Once free, he became one of the most notorious slavers in the Borderland regions. He participated in the Zygerian Conference and would often form alliances with other slavers to increase his profits.\nAfter Gardi captured two Wookiees who were New Republic representatives, Tauran Nartal investigated and confronted Call in Jinorota City on Werncin 3. Call was able to incapacitate and capture the New Republic operative. He sold him to representatives of the Kessel mines and continued his business of capturing sentients. Call worked around the Listehol Run and continued to operate in the Imperial Remnant territory.\nCall owned a Sydon Vehicle Works MRX-BR Pacifier called the Vanquisher, which served as the flagship of his slaving fleet.",
