 "content": "Crant was a nighthunter. He lived on Parein II 4 and attacked the injured Jedi Knight, Valin Draco. They almost killed each other in the resulting fight and Crant bit off Draco's thumb and clamped his jaws around his neck. Draco managed to subdue the beast, but rather than leave it to die, he nursed it back to health and named it Crant.\nWhen Draco became an Inquisitor, he had Crant accompany him on various missions. He took him on one to the Almas Academy and had Crant guard the cage of the captured Jedi, Vhiin Thorla. Crant was later killed by an Alderaanian Resistance team that had infiltrated the academy.",
