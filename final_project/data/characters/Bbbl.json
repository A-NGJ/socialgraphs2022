 "content": "Bbbl was a Northern Mustafarian who was part of a clan led by Father Kkkt. Around 14 BBY, Bbbl was part of a scouting group sent to investigate the crash site of a fiery object on the planet Mustafar. While the group initially found nothing upon their arrival, Bbbl spotted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who hurled a boulder into the Mustafarian and sent them falling into lava.\nThe Northern Mustafarian Bbbl was a member of a Mustafarian clan on the planet Mustafar led by Father Kkkt during the time of the Galactic Empire. Around 14 BBY, the entire clan witnessed a fiery object crash onto the planet. Concerned, Kkkt sent a scouting party—consisting of Bbbl, fellow Northern Mustafarian Sssp, and two Southern Mustafarians including Rrrn—to investigate the site.\nUpon reaching the supposed crash site on lava fleas, the group found no debris. Sssp concluded the object must have landed in one of the planet's lava flows and disintegrated prior to their arrival, advising the rest of them to report back to Kkkt. That was when Bbbl spotted a dark figure through his binoculars, the figure being the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Vader immediately launched a boulder at Bbbl, knocking the Mustafarian off their lava flea and into Mustafar's lava. In the resulting skirmish between Vader and the rest of the scout party, only Rrrn was able to escape and told Kkkt about their attacker.\nBbbl had pale skin.\nLike other Northern Mustafarians, Bbbl wore armor and a breath mask as protection against Mustafar's environment. While with the scout party, Bbbl carried a Mustafarian blaster rifle and a pair of binoculars.\nBbbl appeared in the Star Wars: Darth Vader comic series' twenty-second issue, written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli, and published by Marvel Comics on October 17, 2018.",
