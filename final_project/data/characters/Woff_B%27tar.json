 "content": "Woff B'tar was a Trandoshan slavemaster who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Woff B'tar was a slavemaster on the planet Tatooine. Two notable slaves under his control were the Twi'lek siblings Sadelli and Soolami. Just before being shipped off to Nal Hutta, Sadelli escaped, and was escorted back to Mos Espa with a spacer sent by JillJoo Jab. However, Sadelli would not leave the planet without her younger sister, so JillJoo sent the spacer to also free Soolami.\nDue to the interventions of JillJoo and the spacer, Woff B'tar began a trek to Jabba's Palace to explain the shortage of slaves. When JillJoo learned the whereabouts of Woff, she sent the spacer to kill him. Though he was being escorted by two of Jabba's cronies, the spacer succeeded in killing them.\nWoff B'tar was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for JillJoo Jab in Mos Espa had to hunt down and kill Woff B'tar outside the city.",
