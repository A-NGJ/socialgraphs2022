 "content": "Glaive was a muscular, bald, tall Human male Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic dutifully during the Clone Wars. Serving as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic, Glaive fought bravely until his death on Ohma-D'un in 22 BBY.\nBrought to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training after being identified as Force-sensitive, Glaive was elevated to the rank of Master following years of independent study and training. After this he selected the young, temperamental Falleen Initiate Zule Xiss to become his apprentice.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Glaive and Padawan Xiss reported to Coruscant to receive orders from the High Council. Appointed the rank of General within the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, Glaive and his Padawan led clone troopers against the Confederacy's droid horde. Early into the conflict, the Master-Padawan pair was assigned to team up with Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker in investigating the mysterious communications blackout on the Gungan colony moon, Ohma-D'un. Arriving on the moon, the Jedi discovered that a toxic bioweapon had been released on the moon's population and all of the Gungan's wiped out. As they investigated the corpses, the Jedi were ambushed by Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Durge. Engaging the two Separatist Commanders, Glaive began to break out in blisters caused from the toxic gases still in the atmosphere. Fighting fiercely against Durge and preventing the death of his Padawan, Glaive was caught off guard by Ventress, who decapitated him with her crimson-bladed lightsaber. Durge bid him a sadistic farewell: \"May the Force be with you, meatbag.\"\nHeadstrong and arrogant, Master Glaive was not prone to making friends among his more stoic and meditative colleagues, as demonstrated by his almost antagonistic relationship with fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi. Brutish and intimidating in appearance, Glaive wore a slightly modified Jedi tunic, preferring a sleeveless leather tunic and heavy durasteel gauntlets.",
