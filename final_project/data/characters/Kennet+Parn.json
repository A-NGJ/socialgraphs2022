 "content": "Kennet Parn was a female Miraluka Jedi who served the Jedi Order aboard the space station Carrick Station, selling combat gear during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. A red-haired and light-skinned Miraluka who lacked eyes like the rest of her species, Parn wore either a leather band or a black eyepiece over her eye sockets, and she had a pair of scars running vertically on the right side and horizontally on the middle of her face. Parn wore grey armored robes with black markings, and carried a lightsaber.\nKennet Parn first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, as a PvP Ranked Gear Vendor for the Jedi Knight class. Parn's appearance and gear was changed with the release of Game Update 2.0, when the elder game gear system was overhauled. She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
