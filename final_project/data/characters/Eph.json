During the Clone Wars, Eph accompanied the Believers Crymsin Ost and Disch'l and the assassin Melo Centris on a mission to the planet Caarimon. They boarded a space station that was orbiting the planet and planned to send a virus down to it, via escape pods. However, they were confronted on the station by the Heroes of Cularin, who defeated Eph and his comrades, preventing them from releasing the virus.",
