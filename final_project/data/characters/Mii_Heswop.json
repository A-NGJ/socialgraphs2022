 "content": "Mii Heswop claimed to be a competent spacer and computer technician who had traveled extensively as a crew member on many different ships. In fact, the stout man had no real skills, and little ability to learn. Rather, Heswop was an egocentric individual who was possessed of a great deal of useless trivia about a large range of topics, but virtually no in-depth knowledge.\nWhile on StarForge Station Heswop responded to a call by Captain Dhas Vedij to join the crew of the Rebel privateer vessel Far Orbit.",
