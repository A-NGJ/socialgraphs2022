 "content": "Feemor was a Human male Jedi Knight who served the Galactic Republic. The first Padawan to Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn, Feemor was successfully trained to Knighthood by Jinn, who was in turn granted the title of Jedi Master. Jinn later took a young boy named Xanatos as his second student, but the latter turned against his Master. Jinn's failure as Xanatos's teacher prompted him to dismiss his previous success with Feemor's training.\nThe son of a farmer, the Human male Force-sensitive Feemor was chosen to be trained as a Jedi. Feemor was taken as the first apprentice of Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn at some point after Jinn brought a young boy named Xanatos to the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant. Under Jinn's guidance, Feemor successfully became a Jedi Knight. His Knighthood also saw Jinn promoted to the rank of Jedi Master. Jinn then took Xanatos as his second student.\nIn 53 BBY, Feemor participated in a training lightsaber duel against Jinn and Xanatos at the heart of the Jedi Temple. Feemor and Xanatos both attacked Jinn with their lightsabers, but he repelled all of their attacks with ease. As the fight continued, Jinn and Xanatos locked their lightsabers, and the latter told Feemor to attack Jinn from the Master's left side. Jinn used the Force to throw Feemor to the ground, but in doing so Jinn loosened the grip on his lightsaber, allowing Xanatos to knock the lightsaber out of Jinn's hands and win the fight. As such, Xanatos merely used Feemor to achieve victory for himself.\nXanatos boasted on his victory, priding in his noble ancestry, and Jinn had to reprimand his apprentice for such behavior. Jinn then spoke to Feemor, telling his former student that he was proud of his skills, after which Feemor left the site of the duel. Immediately thereafter, Jinn and Xanatos were assigned to quell a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV. However, during the mission, Xanatos was corrupted by wealth and power and rebelled against his Master, abandoning the Jedi way. Jinn's failure with Xanatos prompted him to dismiss his earlier success as Feemor's teacher, and he began to refer to Xanatos as his first Padawan.\nAfter he became a Jedi Knight, Feemor came to miss his training with his Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. Feemor was visibly hurt when Xanatos admitted that he had used Feemor, stating that the latter had been destined to lose the training fight due to his humble origins. Feemor had blond hair, blue eyes and a fair skin complexion.\nFeemor was unable to defeat his former Master in battle, as Qui-Gon Jinn easily repulsed him with the Force several times. However, Jinn was proud of Feemor's skills and believed that his speed of attacks had improved since their last training. Jinn felt that Feemor was ready to take a Padawan of his own and believed that Grand Master Yoda would soon assign him one. Jinn also believed that said student would be lucky to have Feemor as his Master. Feemor wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber in battle.\nFor many years since the introduction of Qui-Gon Jinn in the novelization of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and the exploration of his early life in subsequent Expanded Universe material, there existed a discrepancy regarding the number of apprentices whom Jinn had during his life. Although most sources detailing Jinn's early life—such as the Jedi Apprentice book series by Jude Watson—stated that Xanatos was Jinn's first apprentice and Obi-Wan Kenobi his second, Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary included a passing mention of another apprentice before Xanatos. Authors Daniel Wallace and Haden Blackman planned to elaborate upon this apprentice in The Essential Guide to Episode I. Blackman developed a female Cathar Jedi for the role of Jinn's Padawan, but The Essential Guide to Episode I was cancelled, and Lucasfilm Ltd. decided that The Visual Dictionary had been in error regarding the existence of the first apprentice.\nIn 2002, The New Essential Guide to Characters reiterated this position by stating that Xanatos was Jinn's first apprentice. However, the thirty-fifth issue of The Official Star Wars Fact File once again included the mention of the apprentice before Xanatos. The contradiction was finally resolved in Jinn's Databank entry on StarWars.com, which stated that Jinn dismissed his success in training the first apprentice after his failure with Xanatos. In 2011, the comic book Jedi—The Dark Side 1 featured a scene of a Jedi Knight named Feemor practicing combat against Jinn and Xanatos. Subsequent dialogue in the comic implied that Feemor had once trained under Jinn. The comic's writer, Scott Allie, later confirmed via Twitter that Feemor was Jinn's first apprentice, finally establishing the Padawan's identity almost twelve years after his offhand mention in The Visual Dictionary.",
