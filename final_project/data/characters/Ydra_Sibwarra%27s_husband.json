 "content": "During the Galactic Civil War Ydra Kilwallen married a man, and took his last name Sibwarra. Six months before the Battle of G'rho, Ydra was on vacation at her parents' when one of her fellow Force Adepts went missing on Chandrila. She took their son, Dev, and left the planet. She feared what the Empire would do to them if they found her, and in her haste did not contact her husband before leaving.",
