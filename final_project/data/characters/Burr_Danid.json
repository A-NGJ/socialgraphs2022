 "content": "Burr Danid was a Human male and an aspiring Royal Guard.\nWhile training at The Squall on Yinchorr, Danid was put forward to face Darth Vader in a duel by the other students, who designated him as the best among them. Despite his skill, Vader defeated him with ease, killing him and throwing his broken body into the depths of The Squall as a reminder that even the best of the Guards training on Yinchorr were helpless against the power of the Force. Years later, Kir Kanos used Danid's name as an alias while traversing the terrain of Dathomir.",
