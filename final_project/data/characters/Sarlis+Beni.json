 "content": "Sarlis Beni was Human male spy who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Sarlis Beni resided in Mos Entha, on the planet Tatooine. During that time, he was part of spy network that also included Kaesii DuPree and the Bothan Lercer Gaia.\nIn 1 ABY, a marginal Tatooinian gang of pirates hijacked a courier ship belonging to the Incom Corporation. The pirates were only after general cargo but they also stole an encrypted datapad with information about a new product Incom was developing. An influential member of the Incom Corporation therefore contacted Sarlis Beni to retrieve the datapad. Lercer Gaia sent a spy to meet with Sarlis in Mos Entha, upon the recommendation of Kaesii DuPree. Sarlis tasked the spy with going to Mos Taike to confront the pirates. After speaking to to their leader, Eyan McDermitt, the spy learned that he would need to go to the Imperial Oasis to find an Imperial commando by the name Jubai Laetlii who was in possession of the datapad. The spy succeeded in stealing the datapad from Jubai unnoticed and delivered it back to Sarlis. Sarlis Beni eventually returned the datapad to his contact from Incom who confirmed the data and paid the spies for their services.\nSarlis Beni was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sarlis Beni was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
