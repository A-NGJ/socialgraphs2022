 "content": "Sidn-ee was a Mirialan Jedi who served within the Jedi Order alongside their sibling, Jedi Till-ee. In 22 BBY, at the outbreak of the Clone Wars during the First Battle of Geonosis, the siblings were part of the assault team led by Jedi Master Mace Windu to the planet Geonosis. Both of them managed to reach the outskirts of the landing zones for the Trade Federation's Command Sphere starships in an attempt to prevent the vessels' escape with the Confederacy of Independent Systems' droid army, but despite their efforts, the siblings were unsuccessful in keeping the Command Spheres from leaving.\nSidn-ee was mentioned in the 2021 reference book Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy.",
