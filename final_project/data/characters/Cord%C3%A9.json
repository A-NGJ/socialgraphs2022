 "content": "Cordé, formerly known as Cordyn, was a handmaiden who served Senator Padmé Amidala in the days leading up to the Clone Wars. She was acting as a decoy when she was killed in an attempt on Amidala's life by Clawdite bounty hunter Zam Wesell.\nCordyn was a human female born on the planet Naboo. She had a sister who worked as a jeweler. In 32 BBY, Cordyn was one of several girls considered by Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces while he was looking for additional handmaidens for newly-elected Queen of Naboo Padmé Amidala, along with Rabene Tonsort. Cordyn strongly resembled Amidala, but Panaka removed her from consideration because her poor hand-eye coordination meant she lacked skill with a blaster or other forms of combat.\nFour years later, after Amidala's two terms as monarch ended, she was asked by Queen Réillata to serve as the Chommell sector's Senator in the Galactic Senate. She came to the conclusion that she would need additional handmaidens to act as decoys. Rabé suggested Cordyn, pointing out that her resemblance to the senator would make her an excellent decoy despite her poor fighting skills. Cordyn was tracked down by Saché on behalf of Amidala and eventually agreed to take on the role, taking on the name Cordé. Amidala also took on two other handmaidens, Versé and Dormé.\nIn the days leading up to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Amidala returned to the galactic capital of Coruscant to take part in a vote on the creation of a Republic army in the wake of the Separatist Crisis.\nOn the orders of Amidala's chief of security, Captain Typho, Cordé served as her decoy, traveling on the senator's ship posing as Amidala while the senator piloted a Naboo starfighter in disguise. Upon landing, Cordé descended the ramp with her retinue, but was soon caught up in an explosion that destroyed the ship and killed both her and six other people including Versé. The explosion was set up by bounty hunter Zam Wesell, who had been hired by Jango Fett to assassinate the senator.\nWhile Cordé lay dying, Amidala ran to her handmaiden's side. With her dying words, Cordé apologized for failing her mistress, though Amidala insisted that she had not.\nNot long after Cordé's death her fellow handmaiden Sabé stood in for Amidala in the senate while Amidala was on a mission. When Sabé attended a soirée at Cantham House hosted by Bail Organa the bodice of the dress she was wearing was held in place by pins designed by Cordé: invisible and entirely secure. Sabé then commented that the pins were 'very clever' as although she had just seen Dormé put the pins in she couldn't find them. Dormé then said that Cordé's whole family was very talented before her voice caught. Sometime later, Amidala shared private tears for Cordé with Duja, another of her handmaidens.\nCordé had brown hair, brown eyes and light skin. Despite being slightly taller than Padmé Amidala, she was considered the closest physical match to her.\nCordé was able to perfect Amidala's voice to the point that even a voice identifier couldn't tell the difference. However, she lacked combat ability, especially with a blaster, due to poor hand-eye coordination.\nCordé was played by Natalie Portman inside the cruiser and walking down the entry ramp, a stunt actress during the explosion that took her life, and Veronica Segura during her death.",
