 "content": "Reeho was a male Human who worked for the Republic Strategic Information Service during the Cold War and Galactic War with the Sith Empire. Around the end of the Cold War, Agent Reeho was assigned to investigate the Grand Acquisitions Race—a competition sponsored by the Chevin Conglomerate to recover a series of rare and unique items—and to discover the Conglomerate's purpose for the event.\nReeho enlisted the help of a Republic-allied operative to investigate the Chevin and recover the items, and through surveillance the two learned that the Chevin were gathering the items as an offering for a Gree fleet that was returning to known space. In return for the operative's help, Reeho gave the individual help recovering several of the items, and convinced the operative to turn the items over to the Republic instead of the Chevin.",
