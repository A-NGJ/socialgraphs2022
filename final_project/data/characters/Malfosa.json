 "content": "Malfosa was a legendary Sher Kar who roamed the Burning Plains of Mustafar. This scorpion-like beast would wipe out entire mining colonies before retreating to its lair. Uprisings were common, but ill-prepared hunters were no match for the mighty Malfosa.\nMalfosa appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
