 "content": "Oleson was a Human male who served as a general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was the commanding officer of the New Academy for Space Pilots, where he also operated as a flight instructor.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, sometime after the Battle of Yavin, General Oleson served on an unidentified planet as the commanding officer of the New Academy for Space Pilots. When Luke Skywalker joined the Planetary Pioneers to train with them, Oleson was his favorite flight instructor at the academy.\nAt some point, Princess Leia Organa came to visit the academy and Skywalker told her about the work of the Planetary Pioneers. However, the tour was interrupted by an emergency siren and the two of them raced to the office of General Oleson. There, the general explained that a small moon from a nearby system had been blasted out of its orbit and was on a collision course with the planet housing the academy. Oleson wanted to call an evacuation, but knew that they would be unable to evacuate everyone in time. Only Skywalker's brave effort to destroy the maverick moon with Zukonium rays saved the planet and the academy.",
