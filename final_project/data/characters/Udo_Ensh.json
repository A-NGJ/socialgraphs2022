 "content": "Udo Ensh was a male Human criminal who was a henchman of a crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A dark-skinned man with long gray hair and a topknot, Ensh wielded a large vibrosword in battle. His lieutenants were known as \"Masked Sirens.\"\nUdo Ensh appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the massively multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Ensh can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon A-31, which appears on the planets Nal Hutta, Ord Mantell, Nar Shaddaa, and Tatooine. The player has the option to kill him or capture him alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord he worked for, where he was encountered, and his fate.",
