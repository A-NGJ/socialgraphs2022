 "content": "Labio was a Devaronian who managed the Starwind Chandlery, a general store and starship outfitter that was on the space station known as StarForge Station. Tired and old by 0 ABY, the Devaronian worked with the Human Mioe and the Wookiee Wurrooba, who were both clerks there.\nLabio first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit. Labio was not given a gender in the book.",
