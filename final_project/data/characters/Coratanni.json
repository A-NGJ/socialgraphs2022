 "content": "Coratanni was a female Human Captain of the Ravagers pirate gang on Rishi during the Galactic War. Born into the Nova Blades, she was never taken seriously by other pirates, who saw her as more suitable for trading than pillaging. Eventually deciding to leave her family, Coratanni hid on a ship departing Raider's Cove. However, the vessel was boarded by far more bloodthirsty Ravagers pirates, though Coratanni defended herself so fiercely that she was offered a place in the gang. Finding her place with the Ravagers, Coratanni was eventually backstabbed by the captain Ruugar. However, she again prevailed, slicing off his fight arm and leg and tossing him overboard to hungry Skar'klas. Becoming the new captain of the Ravagers, she renamed their base Ruugaria into Coratanni Town. Unfortunately for her, Ruugar survived and years later hired a group to inflict his revenge on Coratanni. The group boarded the vessel Soaring Duros and engaged Coratanni's flagship Pearl's Girl in combat, eventually reaching Coratanni herself. The woman and her pet flutterplume Pearl fought fiercely, but were defeated and killed. However, Ruugar didn't live long enough to celebrate, as he betrayed his associates immediately after Coratanni's death and was killed in return.\nCoratanni appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
