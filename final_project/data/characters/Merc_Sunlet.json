 "content": "Merc Sunlet was a human male thief from Tirac Munda. Skilled in multiple languages, Sunlet was often hired by the wealthy for advice on how to keep their own property safe. In the year 0 BBY, Sunlet was present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, and stood near the bar. While he was there, he was witness to a fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and a notorious villain known as Doctor Evazan. Sometime after this event, he was having a conversation with Gela Yeens, who worked for gangster Jabba The Hutt. Concurrently, Kenobi and his young companion fled the Cantina, after two Imperial Stormtroopers began searching for them.\nSunlet was described as a crafty purloiner with a heart of gold. He was a human male with graying hair and fair skin.\nSunlet was well traveled and skilled in many langauges.\nMerc Sunlet first appeared as in the Cantina scene of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, though he is seen very briefly. Although uncredited, he was played by propsman Ted Western. Sunlet was later identified and given a brief backstory in the A New Hope Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in 1996.",
