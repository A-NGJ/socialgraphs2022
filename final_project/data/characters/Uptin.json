 "content": "Uptin was a male Zabrak navigator who served in the Avesta Militia during the Galactic War. In 3638 BBY, Uptin was stationed on the planet Makeb when the Hutt Cartel began to block all of Makeb's comm channels, preventing him from contacting his family. After meeting a Republic strike team, Uptin took them down to the planet to put an end to the Hutt's control.\nBorn on the planet Makeb some time after 3681 BBY, Uptin worked as a navigator during the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic. In 3638 BBY, Uptin was stationed on Keylander Station—in orbit of Makeb—when the forces of the Hutt Cartel invaded his homeworld.\nUptin was male Zabrak with blond hair, yellow eyes and light skin. He cared deeply for his world, feeling frustrated for what the Hutts had done to his people and wishing Makeb had joined the Republic earlier. Uptin spoke Twi'leki.\nUptin appears in the 2013 expansion Rise of the Hutt Cartel to the MMORPG video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. He is featured within the Republic storyline in several quests, including \"Trouble in Paradise\".",
