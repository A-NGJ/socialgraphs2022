 "content": "Mellichae was a male Zabrak Dark Jedi who had a cybernetic arm wearing Mandalorian armor and led the Sith Shadows on Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War.\nMellichae and his minions continuously attacked the village of Aurilia, trying to kill or capture the Force-sensitive residents to gain the Emperor's favor. He was defeated by a Force-sensitive individual who was sent by the Old Man and imprisoned inside the village.\nSometime later, Aurilia was attacked by stormtroopers and Mellichae made his escape. Two days after, a Rebel agent visited the village, looking for a fragment of the Codex of Tython, kept by Mellichae. Captain Sarguillo explained the agent where to find the Dark Jedi. Although the agent was attacked by both Mellichae and the Sith Shadows, he was able to defeat them and recover the piece of Holocron from the Zabrak. Afterwards, Mellichae was once again returned to custody in Aurilia.\nIn Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the introduction of the New Game Enhancements of 2005, Mellichae ordered his Sith Shadows to constantly attack the village of Aurilia, Dathomir. Force-sensitive players of the game were required to locate and kill Mellichae, in order to proceed with the Padawan Trials.\nMellichae was removed from the game, along with Aurilia, when the New Game Enhancements of 2005 were implemented. He made a return to the game, appearing in the Aurilia jail when Aurilia was reintroduced as part of Chapter 7 in November 2007. Star Wars Galaxies was later shut down on December 15, 2011.",
