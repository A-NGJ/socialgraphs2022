 "content": "Gendal Delan was a male Human and the founder of the Pendarran Warriors, who fought alongside the Jedi Order and the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Human male, Gendal Delan was the leader of the organization called the Pendarran Warriors, a military group allied with the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. He also sired a son, named Kolor.\nDuring the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Delan and the Pendarran Warriors fought against the Separatist threat alongside the Grand Army of the Republic. In 20 BBY, his group participated in the Battle of Dreighton, which also saw the involvement of the criminal organization Black Sun and the Hutts; all participants in the battle were wiped out over the period of a month, leaving no survivors.\nAt the end of the war, the Separatists were defeated, but Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, in truth a Sith Lord, declared himself Emperor of the newly-formed Galactic Empire. In order to cement his rule, his first action was to issue Order 66, a preset command the clone troopers were trained to follow, which resulted in the near destruction of the Jedi Order. As allies of the Jedi, the Pendarran Warriors were targeted as well, and every last member, including Delan, was killed.\nMany years later, Delan's son, Kolor, formed another armed organization, Pendarran's Revenge, which was named after his father's group and often fought beside the Alliance to Restore the Republic.",
