 "content": "A human served as an officer in the First Order during its conflict with the Resistance. The officer was stationed in the primary fire control room of the Command Center of Starkiller Base at the time of the Hosnian Cataclysm. When General Armitage Hux gave the order to re-charge the superweapon after the destruction of the Hosnian system, the officer started the process of draining the power of a nearby star and confirmed to Hux that the weapon was charging.\nThe officer was portrayed by an unnamed extra in the 2015 movie Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, while the character's single line was performed by voice actress Catherine Taber , best known for voicing Padm√© Amidala in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.",
