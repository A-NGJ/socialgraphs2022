 "content": "Boadil'par'gasoi, known by his core name Ilparg, was a Chiss male ambassador of the Boadil family. Ilparg was meant to represent the Chiss diplomatic mission to Urch, the capital and homeworld of the Urchiv-ki species with whom the Ascendancy had a treaty. However, the Urchiv-ki's governing Tower Dimension had been subjugated by the Nikardun Destiny, and the diplomatic mission failed.\nAfter the failure of the diplomatic mission to Urch, Admiral Ar'alani suggested the Chiss Ascendancy request an explanation of the Lioaoin military's presence at Urch. Ilparg responded by saying it was a good suggestion, but that he would rather demand explanation; which was Ar'alani's intended reaction.\nBoadil'par'gasoi had a short temper and little patience for the personnel of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, from Admiral Ar'alani to sky-walker Che'ri.",
