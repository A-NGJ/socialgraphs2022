 "content": "Captain-in-Chief Kurakk was a male Trandoshan who was the leader of the Jon-Tow Economic Development Group, a trading consortium that operated on the moon Pinett. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Kurakk was middle-aged and Jon-Tow had became embroiled in a trade dispute with a rival concern, the Corsignis Property Alliance.\nKurakk was large for a Trandoshan and he developed a reputation for being both honest and brutal. Over time, Kurakk mellowed and he did not like engaging in the dispute with Corsignis, because of the negative effects that the disagreement had on the inhabitants of Pinett. However, he believed that Jon-Tow could only back down if Corsignis agreed to back off as well.",
