 "content": "Jams was a male human who served as an officer in the Imperial Navy in the early years of Emperor Palpatine's reign. At some point, he was awarded the rank of junior lieutenant, and was assigned to a Gozanti-class cruiser helmed by Captain Visler Korda, whose mission was to catalogue gas giants on the edge of Wild Space. Like all the other members of the crew, Jams was bullied by the captain, who found him pathetic.",
