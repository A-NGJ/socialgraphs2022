 "content": "Erron Kell was a pilot for the Rebel Alliance who fought at the Battle of Endor. He later became a mercenary.\nWhen the Alliance re-formed into the New Republic, Kell resigned his commission as he chafed under the regulations imposed by the now-legal government. Making use of old allies still working within the military, he managed to requisition a pair of out-of-commission B-wing/E starfighters, which had been too damaged to be used by the military. Kell refurbished them, with assistance from Kuat Drive Yards, into his signature transport, Deathraven. By the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Kell worked as a freelance pilot for anybody who could afford him.",
