 "content": "Raithe Kole was a human male who served as the manager of performers such as galactic superstar Gaya, as well as other talented musicians such as Ouannii and Sandro Alimander. Originally from Alderaan, but raised on Ryloth, Raithe organized a group of scoundrels made up of passengers aboard the star cruiser Halcyon to reclaim the Hayananeya, a Gem known as the \"mother of the Twi'lek singing stones\" to restore hope to the people of Ryloth.\nA proficient gambler and scoundrel, Raithe was known to find success in sabacc as well as various dice games including one based on the Millennium Falcon's infamous Kessel Run. Raithe also wore a purple singing stone on a necklace, in tribute to the Jedi Mace Windu, who played a significant role in overthrowing Separatist rule over Ryloth during the Clone Wars. Gaya and Ouannii also wore purple singing stones cut from the same crystal. Singing Stones were used during the Twi'lek Diaspora as a way for enslaved family members to have a token of their connection.\nRaithe also had dealings with Hondo Ohnaka, and was involved in the smuggling of coaxium in order to aid the Resistance to the First Order during the First Order-Resistance War.",
