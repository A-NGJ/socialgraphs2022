 "content": "Meebo was a male Rodian who lived on the planet Dalicron-4 during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Meebo traveled to Dalicron-4 in 3 BBY and established a business leading offworlders on hunting trips. He was based in the building Meebo's, in the northwest edge of the settlement Dalia, and he kept a dozen Cracian thumpers for use as mounts on his trips. In 3 BBY, the Human Jhara borrowed a number of Cracian thumpers from Meebo.",
