 "content": "Rad Torlent was a Rebel junior officer serving aboard a CR90 corvette during the Galactic Civil War. A native of Neutra Four, Torlent joined the Rebels after the Galactic Empire seized his homeworld. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Torlent was aboard his ship when it was attacked by 13-K, an augmented Infiltrator probe droid sent by Imperial Admiral Damon Krell to seize the vessel and use it to decimate the Rebel fleet. Torlent played dead as 13-K moved through the ship, methodically killing his comrades, before making a break for the ship's communications terminal to warn Rebel leadership. Unfortunately for Torlent, the terminal was located in the room 13-K had made its destination, and the probe droid killed him moments before he could send his crucial message.\nRad Torlent first appeared in Star Wars  45, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1980. In the comic, Torlent was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
