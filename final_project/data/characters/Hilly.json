 "content": "Hilly was a member of the Rebel Alliance stationed at the base on the planet of Arbra shortly after the Battle of Hoth. The Rebel was part of the strategy meeting of Alliance personnel where Princess Leia Organa proposed to hide the Rebel Alliance fleet within the chromosphere of the Arbran sun.\nThe character of Hilly was created by Marvel Comics writer, David Michelinie. The only mention of Hilly occurs by a Rebel soldier off panel, keeping Hilly's identity and gender in doubt. However, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia identifies Hilly as a male, disproving a rumor that Hilly was a woman in the comic who agreed with Organa's support of the plan.",
