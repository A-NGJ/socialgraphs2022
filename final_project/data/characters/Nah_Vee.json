 "content": "Nah Vee was a male Weequay criminal that was imprisoned on Belsavis by the Galactic Republic during the Cold War. During the invasion of Belsavis around 3641 BBY the Rattataki tribe of Blood of Talath broke free and began slaughtering prisoners of other species. After Nah Vee's fellow inmates were all killed, he managed to hide and hold long enough for a Republic individual to arrive and clear enough Rattataki for him to come out. In return, Nah Vee informed his savior of the Project Noble Focus and how much blood Senator Tudos had on his hands.\nNah Vee is a non-player character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game, appearing in the Republic Belsavis story chain quest, \"Countdown to Jailbreak\".\nRepublic players have the following two dialogues choices to deal with Nah Vee:",
