 "content": "This mercenary was a Human male who was hired by Darth Nyriss to follow a lead pertaining to the attacks on her life and to kill the Sith Lord Scourge. He and his partner was slaughtered outside Darth Nyriss's stronghold when they attempted to assassinate Lord Scourge.\nIn 3954 BBY, a Human male mercenary on the planet Dromund Kaas was hired by Darth Nyriss to follow a lead pertaining to the attacks on her life and to kill the Sith Lord Scourge. He and his partner arrived at Darth Nyriss's stronghold in a airspeeder firing the auto-targeting blaster cannon at the Sith Lord, who took shelter behind the statue of the Emperor. After seeing that they were turning around to make another pass, Scourge threw his lightsaber at the speeder clipping the back end. They abandoned the speeder, after beheading the statue of the Emperor and crash landing. He attempted to free his blaster rifle of the wreckage, while his partner drew her blaster pistols and attempted to defend her partner. Scourge leapt over the speeder and slew the mercenary before he could bring his weapon to bear.\nThe male mercenary first appeared in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan, which was released on November 15, 2011.",
