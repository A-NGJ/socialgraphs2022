 "content": "Aarrom was a male Ithorian who owned the cantina known as the Shorn Stabilizer on the planet Nubia during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Aarrom used his even-temper to maintain the peace in the cantina, which came to be known as the best neutral drinking-hole in the Corellian sector, a place where opposing factions could safely meet. The Ithorian, who struck an imposing figure himself, kept four state-of-the-art security droids on site in case any patrons who didn't respect the establishment's neutrality. Aarrom was a common name amongst the Ithorian species and meant waves, specifically breaking waves.\nAarrom was first mentioned in Suns of Fortune, a sourcebook released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system.",
