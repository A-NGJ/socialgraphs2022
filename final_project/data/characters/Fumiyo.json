 "content": "Fumiyo was a Godoan male who was the only known member of his species to speak Galactic Basic. As such, when the Alliance of Free Planets arrived on his planet to attempt to help the citizens in their fight with Godoan's disease, Fumiyo helped inform the Alliance of the plight that was affecting the native Godoans.\nHan Solo eventually noted that the statues of the Dancing Goddess and the Minstrel were key to saving the Godoans and retrieved them. Fumiyo later helped save Lando Calrissian's life, when the man had contracted the disease.",
