 "content": "Cade Skywalker was a Human male bounty hunter, smuggler, and pirate, who in his youth was once the Jedi Padawan of Wolf Sazen. The son of Jedi Master Kol Skywalker and Morrigan Corde , Cade was also a direct descendant of Luke and Anakin Skywalker and a descendant of Ben Skywalker. Cade was also the nephew of Nat Skywalker  and his wife Droo Rawk, half-brother of Gunn Yage , cousin of Annah, and stepcousin of Skeeto, and Micah Rawk.\nThousands of years before his birth, he appeared in Jedi Master Q'Anilia's vision, along with his ancestors, Luke Skywalker, and Anakin Skywalker, who became Darth Vader, as well as Zayne Carrick, all of whom would be affected by the Muur Talisman. After his mother left him as a baby, Cade was raised as a Jedi by his father on Ossus where he would be apprenticed to his father's former apprentice, Wolf Sazen. He spent most of his childhood where he became close to Padawan Azlyn Rae. However, at the start of the Second Imperial Civil War, Cade turned his back on his heritage after being traumatized by watching his father's death at the hands of Darth Nihl and the One Sith. After successfully reviving his master, he swore his revenge and eventually became a pirate and bounty hunter, operating from his personal starship, the Mynock with his longtime companions Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.\nAfter his existence and unique Force powers were discovered by Sith Lord Darth Krayt, Cade was unwillingly pulled into galactic affairs. Caught up in the power struggle between the Sith and the exiled Emperor Fel, Cade became willing to do whatever it took to ensure he was left alone, but was eventually captured by the Sith. Following his capture, Krayt acknowledged that Cade had more power than he had ever seen in any Jedi, and offered him to join him and the Sith. Refusing his offer, Cade was forced to watch his friends die when Darth Maladi planted Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-Kul coral seeds. Cade had no option but to help both of his friends by using his anger to cure them at a great cost. With the dark side corrupting him, Cade was surprised that Krayt showed him his father's lightsaber and revealed his former identity as Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett. Skywalker was able to escape when he injured Nihl and Talon.\nAfter being briefly captured by the Sith, Cade was reunited with his uncle and his childhood sweetheart, Azlyn Rae, who secretly became an Imperial Knight. After arriving to the secret Hidden Temple on Taivas, and been followed by several Imperial Knights, Cade was angered by Azlyn's betrayal until he had met with the new Jedi Council members, K'Kruhk, Tili Qua and T'ra Saa. Together, they participated in a successful mission that saw the presumed death of Darth Krayt. However, Krayt's traitorous advisor conspired to keep this fact a secret and appointed himself Regent over Krayt's Empire. After saving Azlyn's life, against her wishes, Cade and Azlyn's relationship fell apart. Angered by the destruction his actions continually caused, Cade left for Tatooine, where he began raiding Black Sun shipments. These events drew the attention of both his mother and his half-sister Gunn Yage.\nAfter leaving Tatooine, Cade and his crew accepted a recovery mission on Wayland, site of the failed Ossus Project. There, Cade encountered Darth Maladi, who was seeking to perfect a new Sith bioweapon. Cade attempted to heal Blue, who had been captured and implanted with the weapon, but to no avail. Wolf Sazen tracked Cade to Wayland and convinced him to use the light-side of the Force to heal Blue, which was successful. As a result of these events, Cade finally rejected the dark-side but resolved to not rejoin the Jedi Order, believing the Force shaped him for a different destiny, to destroy the One Sith.\nCade set off on a quest for vengeance, accompanied by his friends. On Utapau, Skywalker killed Sith scientist Vul Isen and learned of Krayt's return from the dead. He would encounter his mother once more on the Wheel, where under the council of his father, forgave her and healed her from certain death. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker returned to the Jedi Hidden Temple on Taivas to defend against the incoming attack there. The battle was a disaster for the Jedi and its allied forces, and Nat Skywalker sacrificed his life to save that of his nephew. Distraught by his uncle's death, Cade led an elite strike team to shut down Coruscant's planetary defenses in the final battle of the war. Cade lost his former master in the fight, but succeeded in resisting temptation and as a Jedi, killed Krayt once and for all. To ensure the Dark Lord of the Sith would never return, Cade took his mother's ship to the planet's sun, where he intended to incinerate both himself and Krayt's body. However, under the guidance of Luke Skywalker, Cade escaped the doomed ship, and was rescued by Syn, R2-D2, and his lover, Deliah Blue. With the war over, Cade Skywalker set out for a distant place where the group could be in peace.\nThousands of years before Cade Skywalker's birth, he appeared in a vision to the Jedi Master Q'Anilia, along with his ancestors Anakin Skywalker  and Luke Skywalker, as well as Zayne Carrick; all four of these individuals would later be affected by the Muur Talisman. The vision also showed Karness Muur, hundreds of Rakghouls, and a burning city.\nCade Skywalker was born the son of Kol Skywalker, a powerful member of the Jedi High Council, and Morrigan Corde, an Imperial agent. However, his mother left when he was just a baby, as she didn't want to become close to him. From an early age, Cade was trained as a Jedi by various teachers, including the aged Whiphid K'Kruhk. Eventually Cade was apprenticed to his father's former apprentice, Wolf Sazen.\nHe spent at least some of his childhood at the New Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he explored the secrets of its foundations and the outer city with the young Shado Vao. Cade believed that his father was unaware of this, despite the fact that he and Shado fell asleep at the midday meal. On Ossus, Cade became close to another Padawan, Azlyn Rae. One time, Cade kissed her on the cheek.\nDuring his time as a Padawan, Cade, Wolf, his father and Shado visited Wayland, one of the planets for Kol's Ossus Project. Unfortunately, the project had been sabotaged and Wayland became covered in Vong-like life. The natives tried to attack the Yuuzhan-Vong that accompanied the Jedi, but the group managed to escape and were picked up by an Imperial star destroyer under the command of Moff Nyna Calixte .\nAs a Padawan in 130 ABY, Cade was involved in the battle to defend the Jedi Academy on Ossus from the Sith. His master, Wolf Sazen, ordered Cade and Shado Vao to evacuate the planet in a Jedi Shuttle full of younglings. However, Cade desperately wanted to stay and fight with his father, Kol. He argued the point, but eventually obeyed his father and went to the shuttle.\nJust after boarding the shuttle, Cade sensed that his master had been struck down, and that his father was now fighting the Sith alone. Much to Shado's dismay, Cade left the shuttle to fight by his father's side.\nAs soon as Cade joined Kol however, he was ordered to take Wolf back to the shuttle. Cade was devastated, but did as he was told. Aboard the shuttle which was now leaving Ossus, Wolf nearly died in the arms of Cade. Cade could not accept that however, and focused his anger to the point where he used a power known as Dark transfer to successfully revive his master.\nAt that point, Cade felt the death of his father. Overwhelmed with anger, Cade promised revenge on Darth Nihl, the Sith that had murdered Kol. Cade left the shuttle one final time in a X-83 TwinTail starfighter, to kill the Sith. In his X-wing, he cleared a path for the shuttle, in an effort to allow its escape into hyperspace. Cade's fighter was shot down by an Imperial Predator-class fighter, though he managed to survive by sealing his flight suit and jettisoning just as his ship exploded. Withdrawing from the Force so the Sith wouldn't sense him, he fell into deep meditation in order to conserve oxygen. He awoke three days later floating over Ossus, where he was picked up by Rav and his crew.\nWhen Cade revived his master with an unknown Force power, Darth Krayt sensed a dark murmur in the Force, and recognized that it came from a Jedi, not a Sith. Krayt vowed to find this Jedi and lure him completely to the dark side, calling him a \"dark light in the Force\". Three days after the massacre, the pirate Rav found Cade floating in the debris around the planet. It was his future crewman Jariah Syn who convinced Rav to rescue Cade. Soon after, he apprenticed himself to Rav and joined his crew.\nSome years passed after the Massacre at Ossus, and Cade had freed himself from Rav's debt. Cade had become captain of a light freighter called Mynock whose crew included Deliah Blue, the ship's mechanic, and co-pilot Jariah Syn. He hid both his last name and his Jedi ability from everyone who knew him, especially his crew mates. One of Cade and his crew's favorite haunts during this time was Rik's Cantina on Coruscant.\nAround 137 ABY the crew of Mynock was contracted by Rav to locate bond-skipper Naxy Screeger on the planet Lok. After locating him, the group also came across a Jedi healer named Hosk Trey'lis. Cade prevented Syn from killing the Jedi, his reasoning that Jedi were worth more alive than dead. The group left Lok with both Screeger and Trey'lis in tow. After turning in their bounties on Socorro, Rav paid them in death sticks, which, though pleasing Cade, enraged the rest of the crew.\nAround this time Cade was being haunted by the Force ghost of his ancestor Luke Skywalker, who was pleading for Cade to return to his Jedi legacy. However, Cade was growing increasingly agitated with these visitations, using death sticks to block them out, and even going so far as threatening to end his own life for Luke to leave him.\nAs the Mynock's crew prepared for liftoff from Socorro, they were approached by Princess Marasiah Fel and her companion Astraal Vao. The Princess was demanding passage to Vendaxa, and the two were being pursued by the Sith Darth Talon. She tried using a mind trick on him but Cade, being a Jedi, was resistant to it until he saw the Sith. He initiated emergency take-off procedures, and headed toward Vendaxa, intent on delivering the Princess to her father, so that he could get paid, and then sell the both of them to the Empire, earning enough credits to be out of Rav's debt.\nAstraal Vao, having pre-arranged a rendezvous with her brother Shado if ever they were in trouble, guided the crew of Mynock and Princess Fel to the crash site where Shado and Astraal's parents died. There, they came under attack from an acklay, and only the timely arrival of Shado and Wolf Sazen saved Astraal from being impaled upon the acklay's fore-claw. With the immediate danger over, Princess Marasiah set about arranging safe passage with the two Jedi, revealing that she knew of Mynock crew's intention to turn her in for the bounty on her head.\nNot wanting to be recognized by his former Master, Cade stayed in the shadows and did not argue with the Princess. However, Jariah called him on his wanting to cut his losses, using his name as he did so which attracted the attention of the two Jedi. Turning to face the Jedi, Cade calmly stared down his former Master and admitted his name was Cade. If Wolf recognized his former pupil after their years apart, he gave no sign; instead choosing to turn to direct Princess Fel to where he and Shado had secreted their own ship. A sudden explosion signaled that ship's destruction, however and was quickly followed by an attack by Darth Talon, who used the dark side to provoke a number of native fauna into attacking alongside her.\nTalon singled out Wolf Sazen and brought him down with Force lightning, intending to kill him, but Marasiah intervened, hoping for revenge for the death of her Master, Elke Vetter. Sia was no match for the Sith, however, and Talon swatted her away with the Force. Wrapped in Force lightning, Wolf was still able to ask Cade to take the Princess to safety, but the captain of Mynock only stood by numbly, his mind flashing back through the years to a similar situation on Ossus.\nSnapping back to the present with an expletive, Cade unloaded both barrels of his Rawk chopped special at the Sith, and after a moment both Blue and Syn joined him, with Blue declaring they'd all gone insane. Syn then told her that it was a \"good\" insane. Darth Talon however, easily deflected their blasts and disarmed them with a wave of her hand then advanced upon them, her lightsaber at the ready.\nWith an angry cry, Cade used the Force to lift some nearby wreckage and hurled it and Talon into the nearby forest. Retrieving his blaster, Cade calmly directed the stunned onlookers to head for Mynock. However, they were soon to discover that Talon had sabotaged Mynock, forcing them to remain on Vendaxa until repairs could be made. Meanwhile, Darth Talon remained hidden in the shadows nearby.\nAfter the battle, Cade had a conversation with his former master, telling him that he wasted years looking for a man that didn't exist. That was followed by an argument with his friends, with Syn pulling a blaster on him. Marasiah Fel approached him, saying she knew he was a Skywalker. She then went on saying how she could disappear from her destiny. But she also told him that she would not run away from her responsibilities.\nImperial Knights arrived, but they were shot down by the Sith. They survived the crash, and the battle with the Sith had begun. Cade rushed to battle with his blaster telling Syn and Blue to lift off. When Cade entered the battlefield, he was flooded with the memories of the Massacre at Ossus. He was so dazed that he did not see a Sith approaching from behind. It was Princess Marasiah that saw the Sith and charged at him, cutting down the Sith and saving Cade's life, but not without injury. Cade then attacked Darth Nihl. During the fight, Cade told Nihl he saw him kill his father at Ossus. Nihl said he killed many Jedi that day, and that his father might have been one. Cade shouted that his father was Kol Skywalker, and began to use his rage against Nihl, despite warnings from Master Sazen. Jariah Syn entered the fight and hit the Sith with a blaster bolt, but promptly got Force pushed away. Afterward, Cade kicked Nihl off a cliff, and got everyone on board the Mynock.\nWhile aboard the Mynock, Cade heard that Marasiah was dying. When Cade said he could help her, Antares Draco attacked him, blaming him for the condition Marasiah was in. Draco eventually stood down and let Cade help Marasiah. Cade healed her with the lightning technique he used to heal Wolf Sazen years earlier.\nAfter the group arrived on Bastion, Cade and Blue slept together. The following morning, he slipped away from Blue and Jariah Syn, leaving them on their own. He stated to Wolf Sazen that he could not trust Syn anymore. Cade then offered a ride to Sazen and Shado Vao, but told them to not get any ideas regarding him rejoining the Jedi Order. He later found out that Fel placed five homing beacons on the Mynock, who was wary of Krayt finding him. Fel expected Skywalker to only find one or two, but Cade disabled all of them.\nLater, Cade, Wolf, and Shado traveled to the Wheel. Unknowingly, Cade was being pursued by numerous agents of Krayt's faction of the Galactic Empire, including his mother, Morrigan Corde, a deep cover Imperial agent who had been reactivated by Nyna Calixte. The two Imperial agents suspected he was either going to Hapes, which was neutral during the Sith-Imperial War, or Ossus. But Morrigan decided to quit hunting her son, so when they landed on Ossus, she killed the Imperial agent accompanying her, Jor Torlin.\nCade left Shado and Wolf on the Wheel, then proceeded to Ossus, where, after ingesting several death sticks, he had visions of his ancestors Mara Jade and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter morphed into Darth Vader and dueled him. Vader warned him of the perils of falling to the dark side and scolded him on his lack of control. His ancestor was then blown away as Cade was found by the Whiphid Jedi Master K'Kruhk, a one-time teacher of Cade, who healed his mental trauma. Sazen and Vao then arrived as well.\nCade then asked Sazen to complete his training. Sazen accepted, and Cade began his training again under the tutelage of both Sazen and K'Kruhk. During a lightsaber practice session with Vao, they both fell into a repository of priceless Jedi artifacts, whereupon they were attacked by two Yuuzhan Vong, Liaan Lah and Choka Skell.\nMaster Shaper Nei Rin ordered her two Vong bodyguards to cease their attack on the two Jedi. Rin, once a friend of Kol and the leader of the terraforming project on Ossus, revealed herself as the keeper of the Jedi artifacts left on Ossus after the massacre, and claimed that Cade should become their keeper.\nCade refused, and after being confronted by Master Sazen about his fears, was once more visited by Luke Skywalker, who told him to fix his mistake of turning in fellow Jedi Hosk Trey'lis by rescuing him on Coruscant. As Cade prepared to leave for Coruscant, Rin gave him his father's lightsaber, and K'Kruhk gave him R2-D2, a loyal friend and companion to the Skywalker family since the Clone Wars, to serve aboard his ship.\nCade's approach to Coruscant was detected by Imperial forces and by Darth Krayt himself, but Cade was able to elude Skull Squadron and hide in the depths of the Coruscant underworld. Leaving R2-D2 in charge of the Mynock, but not before leaving a message for his friends Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue. Cade walked toward Rik's Cantina, blasting a would-be mugger and scaring off his confederates in the process.\nAt the cantina, Cade encountered Chak and Kee, two old friends. But he had no clue where Syn and Blue had taken Chak's ship, the Grinning Liar. His impertinence offended the Wookiee, but amused Queen Jool, the Hutt owner of the establishment. He left the access codes to his ship with her in case he did not return, instructing her to turn them over to his former crew mates if they showed up.\nCade entered the Temple of the Sith using secret routes he discovered when he lived there, and reaching with his Force senses, found Hosk manacled to a wall inside the structure. When he released the healer, the Bothan attempted to warn him that he had given in and betrayed his would-be rescuer, but Cade would have none of it, retorting \"no one dies for me.\"\nAs they made their way out, they were ambushed by Darth Talon, who waited for them by a long causeway. She subdued Hosk with a Force push, but enraged Cade by telling him he and his quarry were both wanted alive. Cade's eyes shifted, signifying his enthrallment by the dark side, and he overpowered the Twi'lek. His victory faded fast, as Darth Nihl, suddenly appeared and choked him into submission. Nihl went on to inform Krayt of his victory. Meanwhile on Ossus, Wolf, meditating on the Force, received a vision: Cade turned toward him, his face half in shadow with the dark side gleaming in his eyes.\nFollowing his capture, Cade was tied up and tortured by Darth Maladi using a lethal dose of ixetal cilona, though the poison had no effect due to Cade's past usage of death sticks and powerful Force abilities boosting his immunity to it. Darth Krayt acknowledged that this Skywalker had more power than he had ever seen in any Jedi. Krayt wanted Cade to join him, but Cade refused the offer from his father's true murderer.\nKrayt had imprisoned Syn and Blue, and while they were in the Sith's hands, Maladi implanted Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-Kul coral seeds into them that mutated their bodies using the dark side. Cade had no option but to help both of his friends by using his anger to cure them at a great cost.\nKrayt invited Cade with Talon and his most loyal Sith adviser, Darth Wyyrlok, to his chambers. There, Krayt surprised Cade by showing him Kol Skywalker's lightsaber encased in transparisteel, giving Cade's father a place of honor. Cade was further surprised when Krayt revealed his knowledge about the Jedi and his true identity of A'Sharad Hett, a Jedi Master from the Clone Wars and survivor of Order 66.\nKrayt then recited the story of his duel on Tatooine against Obi-Wan Kenobi near the Lars homestead over a century prior, and how he was cast out of both Tusken and Jedi society. After finishing his story, Krayt found Cade to be barely moved. Talon then attacked Cade after he mocked Krayt, and she was nearly killed when he used his powers to re-open her recently healed wounds.\nKrayt, however, prevented this and asked of Cade that he allow the Dark Lord to focus his anger into strength through the Sith teachings. Cade agreed, and was then ordered to heal Darth Talon, as she would become his Sith Master. During his Sith training, Cade developed an intimate relationship as well as a deep bond with his master that was created when he healed her. They presumably slept together, however after Talon left the bed, she told Krayt that he was just pretending to be like them. Still, Krayt was sure that he would fall to their side permanently.\nThe next day, Krayt placed Cade in the Embrace of Pain, torturing him while he continued to tell him about his own fall to the dark side. After the Embrace, Cade finally decided to escape the Temple, but was caught by Talon. He was taken back to Lord Krayt.\nKrayt grabbed Cade by the throat and told Cade that his pretense at being a Sith was over and that he must now become Sith. Krayt ordered Cade to kill Hosk Trey'lis or die, but Cade refused to kill the Jedi. Krayt then killed Trey'lis himself, evoking Cade's anger. But Cade then received a vision of his father, telling him \"That which can heal, can also break.\" Using his power, Cade shattered the transparisteel case containing his father's lightsaber and stabbed Talon through the stomach as she tried to attack him and he engaged Nihl in a lightsaber duel. Drawing on his anger, Cade's eyes changed to the sulfuric red they had been once before.\nCade bested Nihl by severing his arm and throwing him against the wall, finally defeating the Nagai Sith Lord. Krayt ordered Cade to kill his Hand in an effort to tip Cade over to the dark side permanently. To Krayt's surprise, Cade refused because that was what Krayt wanted him to do, and instead turned his blade on the Dark Lord himself. During their duel, as Krayt continued to try to persuade Cade to give into the dark side, Cade said he saw through the Force just how twisted Krayt really was, and questioned whether the rest of the Sith would be willing to follow him if they knew his true condition. He taunted Krayt, saying that even if he died, he would die as himself, but if Krayt killed him, then he'd condemn himself to death as a mindless Yuuzhan Vong growth.\nJust as their duel was reaching its climax, Morrigan Corde blasted open the window behind them, shooting Krayt in the back. Cade then jumped out and was rescued by Jariah Syn aboard the Mynock, who pulled him inside. The Mynock then escaped the planet and jumped to hyperspace. Before this, Corde revealed herself to be Cade's mother over her comlink. Cade demanded answers, but she replied that he would not be getting any and cut transmission. Krayt, furious at Cade's escape, began planning to break him, use his powers to heal himself, and then kill him, while Talon and Nihl were punished harshly for their failures.\nCade worked with Chak, Kee and Syn, in an attempt to recover the Grinning Liar from Rav. After a brief fight, Rav handed the ship over and was forced to swear the Bloody Bones oath to the Jedi. Cade, however had no idea that Rav was reporting to Maladi. After placing Naxy in the cargo hold, Cade set course for Rawk's Nest, on the planet Iego. He apologized to Blue for what happened with the Sith, and she gave him a kiss on the cheek. They then assisted \"Bantha\" Rawk in defending his home against some Black Sun mercenaries.\nWhile the others enjoyed a pool party, Cade had a talk with Uncle Bantha, whom he knew as Nat Skywalker. Cade revealed he ran into his mother, and Nat then told him about the history between his parents, and that his mother had abandoned them. When Cade saw the massacre of New Coral City, he also saw an arrest warrant for him stating that he was a terrorist and was wanted for the attack on the Sith Temple. Cade then confirmed his last name to his cousins. Bantha yelled at him for not thinking and they punched each other.\nDuring the night Cade \"acted like he had seen a ghost.\" He sneaked off to the Mynock,and the spirits of Luke and Kol Skywalker tried to counsel him. Luke told him to use meditation to clear his head but Cade thought of using his Sith abilities, instead. His father warned him of the dark side and that the technique he showed him in the Temple of the Sith was for defense. The ghosts warned him of events that he must be ready for. When their spirits departed, Cade used his death stick to get relief for one night. Shortly thereafter he walked out, stoned, and was attacked by a masked figure who followed him from Socorro. He was saved by the timely intervention of his uncle. But the figure was Azlyn Rae, an old friend of his and fellow Padawan before the Sith attacked Ossus.\nA scouting party of Imperials showed up looking for Cade, having heard from Black Sun. Cade was determined to leave, but Bantha told him to hide. Rae sent the Imperials off with a mind trick. Afterward, Bantha told him to change his name, looks, ship and friends and to not ever to use the Force again. But Cade determined that there was only one way to end the threat of the Sith: kill Darth Krayt. Again, Bantha berated him for trying to do something stupid. But Cade had a point—the New Sith Order was having internal conflicts and with Krayt dead, they'd collapse on each other and everyone would leave him alone. But he needed allies; he didn't trust either Roan Fel or Gar Stazi and he believed that there were no Jedi to find until Bantha revealed the existence of the Hidden Temple.\nGuided by Bantha, Cade along with the Mynock's crew and Azlyn Rae went to the newly revealed Hidden Jedi Temple  on the planet of Taivas.\nWhen the Mynock landed, Cade and his crew discovered that not only were Wolf Sazen and Shado Vao in the temple, but also that they were followed by Imperial Knights Marasiah Fel, Antares Draco, and Ganner Krieg, who were guided there by Azlyn. After a brief confrontation between the Jedi and the Imperial Knights, both parties put away their weapons and began to talk at Wolf's request. Cade immediately realized it was Azlyn who \"betrayed\" them and after he demanded to know why, he was told by Princess Fel that Azlyn was in fact an Imperial Knight. When the Imperial Knights explained that they were on a mission of peace, Wolf informed them that the Jedi Council would receive them. This new Jedi Council was formed by Jedi Masters K'Kruhk, Tili Qua and T'ra Saa, two of whom had fought in the Clone Wars.\nCade revealed to the council that Darth Krayt was none other than fellow Clone Wars veteran and former Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett and how ill he was, despite T'ra Saa's disbelief a human could survive the past century and a half. He also proposed to the council his plan to assassinate Krayt, arguing that the former Jedi Master had no heir as Dark Lord of the Sith, and that it was his will alone that kept his followers from turning on each other. However, the council refused, saying that assassination was not the Jedi way and as Jedi, they respected all life - even the Sith to which Cade retorted that Krayt had already killed countless innocents trying to achieve his \"vision\". He further argued that maybe it was the will of the Force that Krayt be destroyed and maybe assassination should become the Jedi way before Krayt tracks him down and forces him to use his healing powers.\nWhile the disturbed Council was deliberating, Cade went with Shado for a ride. Shado believed that Cade's Sith training had made him dangerous to the Jedi as well as himself, and confronted Cade to prove that he could no longer choose between light and dark. Cade defeated his friend and began to use the dark side against him, however he stopped before killing him to prove that he was still under control. When the two returned to the Temple, Wolf revealed that he had sensed the confrontation. He implored Cade not to use his dark side techniques again, but Cade refused saying that both sides of the Force were just tools for him. Wolf began to fear even more for his troubled old apprentice.\nThe Council ultimately decided not to go through with the assassination plan, for if Krayt wound up dead, someone else might take his place or it might splinter the Sith and make them more dangerous. They preferred to let the Sith undermine each other. Despite this, Cade decided to do it with the help of his crew. Draco, Krieg, and Rae joined him under orders from Fel, and Shado also decided to come with them, hoping that Cade would not become subservient to the leader of the Sith, or turn into a second-coming of Krayt.\nCade and his allies headed for the Deep Core. While journeying there, Azlyn tried to talk to him, but he wouldn't listen to her. While meditating, Cade received a vision of a Jedi. After this, the Mynock was pulled out of hyperspace and into a Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer: the Iron Sun. Once inside, Cade and his allies split up to explore the ship.\nCade and his party eventually came across a group of Rakghouls. During a brief skirmish with them, Cade was bitten and Azlyn was scratched. The skirmish ended when an ancient Jedi named Celeste Morne  regained control of the rakghouls. Celeste saw that Cade and Azlyn had been infected by the Rakghoul plague and imprisoned them. Celeste explained the events that have happened in her long life: her meeting with Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick, the Muur Talisman attaching itself to her, and her confrontations with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.\nWhen the plague began to transform him and Azlyn, Cade asked if the plague was a disease or the work of the Force. Celeste said it was an affliction, and Cade realized he could cure it. He used his healing power to rid himself and Azlyn of the plague, impressing both Celeste and the spirit of Karness Muur. Celeste agreed to join Cade and his allies in their quest to assassinate Krayt.\nThe party journeyed to Had Abbadon, where they attacked the local Imperial base. After taking the base, Celeste allowed one Sith to escape to tell Krayt about the attack. The party then settled in to wait for Krayt.\nDuring this time, Azlyn tried to kill Celeste and destroy the Muur Talisman, since she believed Morne was evil, but Cade prevented her from doing so. However, during an argument, Cade and Azlyn both realized that their old feelings, feelings of love for each other had resurfaced. They spent the night together, until the voice of Karness Muur interrupted them. Cade went to confront Morne. He told her that if Muur continued to mess with him and his friends, he would shove her and the talisman into a rocket and send it into a black hole.\nLater, Celeste sent Krayt a message while using Muur's voice . Celeste showed Krayt that Cade was her prisoner and that Muur had the power to help him. Krayt took the bait, and traveled to Had Abbadon with Darths Maladi, Talon, Stryfe, and Wyyrlok. Once there, Cade and his allies sprang the trap. Celeste set her rakghouls on Krayt while Cade dueled with Talon. Talon told him that the bond he created was driving him closer to the dark side. Unfortunately, Muur declared his usefulness over and had the rakghouls turn on his companions.\nAfter once again defeating Talon, Cade dueled Darth Stryfe, and quickly defeated him with some help from Syn's explosives. Soon after this, Muur blasted both Darth Krayt and Azlyn Rae with Force lightning. Celeste then regained control and Force pushed Krayt off a cliff. Cade was enraged that Azlyn had been hurt.\nCeleste told Cade that she had never met anyone like him: no matter how close he walked to the dark side, he wasn't at all tempted by the Muur Talisman. Celeste asked Cade to kill her, and he complied, igniting his lightsaber through her chest. The Talisman attached itself to him, and Muur said he was finally free. But Cade proved to truly be above Muur's influence, and used the Force to obliterate the Talisman, destroying Karness Muur forever.\nCade rushed to Azlyn and used his healing powers, but she was too heavily wounded for them to completely work. Shado advised Cade to let her go, but he refused, saying he would keep trying until he could find a medical facility. Blue suggested taking Rae to his aunt Droo, and Cade agreed. As they tried to leave, Krieg and Draco tried to come with them, but Cade refused to allow them to since they tried to secure the Talisman for Fel, and Shado Force pushed them away when Krieg tried to prevent them from taking Azlyn. Cade then boarded the ship with his friends and set a course for Kiffex.\nLittle did Cade know that Darth Krayt had survived the fall, only to be betrayed shortly afterwards by his most trusted advisor, Darth Wyyrlok III, who finally killed the Dark Lord by blasting him with Force lightning.\nCade continued to use his healing powers to keep Azlyn alive until they reached Kiffex. At one point, Azlyn regained consciousness, and told Cade to allow her to die. Cade refused, saying he couldn't lose her again. After being forced down by a storm, Nat and Droo came to get them. Droo put Azlyn in a healing pod and Nat promised Cade they would save her. Cade then collapsed from exhaustion.\nCade dreamed about the night he and Azlyn spent together on Had Abbadon, which quickly turned into a nightmare of her being wounded. When he woke up, he went to help Nat and Droo. But Nat refused to allow him to help since his healing powers were pushing him to the dark side. With nothing else to do, Cade and Jariah decided to go to a local town to relax. He also told Shado, who was returning to the Hidden Temple, to tell the Jedi Council that Krayt was dead.\nMeanwhile, Droo and Nat couldn't heal Azlyn because she was pushing their attempts away. Droo was ready to give up, but Nat refused, saying Cade had seen too many broken promises. He decided on a desperate plan: create a life saving suit for Azlyn, similar to the one worn by Darth Vader.\nCade and Jariah ended up starting a fight in town. When the Kiffu Guardians showed up, Ahnah among them, showed up, Cade wouldn't stop fighting, even turning his weapon on Ahnah. Only Jariah standing between them got him to calm down.\nWhen Cade returned, Azlyn confronted him. She had been placed in a life-preserving suit that was constantly pumping bacta through her system. Azlyn was furious that Cade hadn't let her go, instead having condemned her to live in a suit of armor. Also, Nat and Droo said Cade had lied to them, and Droo said he couldn't come back for a long time. Cade, Jariah and Deliah left Kiffex in the Mynock.\nCade, Jariah, and Deliah decided to raid Black Sun shipments on Tatooine, the homeworld of Cade's ancestors, and sell them to Muun fence Muz under Cade's alias of Luke Skywalker. However, the Mynock lacked a trivalve for takeoff, stranding the trio. Deliah impersonated Imperial Mission member Astraal Vao to obtain it.\nAfterward, at a cantina called Gusha's Luck, Cade met his half-sister, Gunn \"Gunner\" Yage , a pilot of Skull Squadron. Yage had been sent by her mother, Moff Nyna Calixte, to track the smuggler. Yage flirted with Cade, then spiked his drink, causing Skywalker to fall unconscious. Yage held Cade captive in stun cuffs, which would shock him if he struggled, as she began to transport him to Moff Nieve Gromia, the Empire's custodian for the Outer Rim. Unknown to Yage, Gromia had sent three Black Sun assassins to hunt down and eliminate both Yage and Skywalker: a Blood Carver named Ku Vrat, and an Anzati married couple named Sint and Nakia Yoru.\nDeciding to show Gunn a little trick, Skywalker used the Force to choke her. Despite this, she attempted to shoot him, which allowed the three assassins to topple Yage's landspeeder and attack the pair. The pair took cover behind the downed vehicle. Noticing that a sandstorm was approaching, the two enemies found they had no choice but to rely on each other. The pair was then guided by Luke's spirit to shelter in the form of his childhood home, the old abandoned Lars homestead, and decided to rest until the storm died. During the sandstorm the assassins lost track of them.\nDuring their time in the homestead, Gunn mentioned she was Rulf Yage's daughter. When Cade heard this, he went ballistic at her, calling her father a butcher for what he had done to the Jedi on Ossus. Yage defended her father by saying the Sith had ordered the attack and that her father was never the same after he had carried out their order. Eventually, the two fell asleep. When the sandstorm ended, Cade was awoken by the spirit of Luke Skywalker. After several visions of Luke's old family, Cade attacked his ancestor, but calmed down after Luke refused to fight. Luke then showed Cade a vision of himself as a Sith with the corpses of everyone he cared about at his feet. Luke asked Cade if that was what he wanted, because it would happen if he continued on his current path. Cade said he didn't want that, and Luke's spirit left.\nCade awoke to find Nakia and Sint trying to feed on him and Gunn. Cade slagged Nakia, causing Sint to cry out to his wife. This woke Gunn, who immediately helped Cade fight the assassins. Around this time, Jariah and Morrigan Corde arrived at the shelter and killed the Blood Carver. Sint pulled a lightsaber on Cade, but Cade had skill on his side, and cut Sint down. Nakia tried to seduce Cade into submission, but Gunn stunned her. They then carried the Anzati outside to find Syn and Corde. They took the assassins' ship and headed for the Black Sun boss who hired them while Gunn set out after Moff Gromia to arrest her for her part in the attempted assassination.\nCade talked with Corde during the trip. Corde admitted that she had left him and Kol because she felt her loyalties lay with the Empire above all else, though she claimed that if she had known the Sith would attack Ossus, she would not have kept silent. She said after Ossus, she thought he had died with his father, and she felt that nothing else mattered in her life. Cade left the room before she said that she always loved him and his father.\nCade arrived at the Black Sun base and threatened the Black Sun boss into a deal. But Corde killed the boss, knowing he would never keep his word. Cade lashed out at her with Force lightning, but Syn reminded him about how he got on Kiffex, and Cade calmed down, remembering that he didn't want to turn out like that. He told Corde to find her own ride off the station, and left the station in the assassin shuttle. He and Syn returned to Tatooine to find Blue had repaired their ship and they left Tatooine.\nGunn, meanwhile, heard from Gromia that Corde and Calixte were the same person and that she was Cade's half-sister, something she refused to believe.\nAfter their narrow escape from Tatooine, Cade and his crew weren't looking for another endeavor. Trying to stay out of the spotlight, they traveled to Zeltros where they could relax for a while in Jool's new cantina. However, their rest was short-lived, when Rav arrived and presented to them with an very tempting offer. With a reward of a million credits, the job was deemed too good for them to refuse. The job involved Cade and company traveling to Wayland, one of the sites of Kol Skywalker and the Yuuzhan Vong's use of the Ossus Project, a project that went horribly wrong. The trio arrived to find something different, and Cade would be forced to revisit his father's 'sins'. Cade soon found himself separated from Jariah and Deliah who had been captured as they were about to discover the source of the Vongspawn.\nCade made his way to a secret lab on Wayland, where he was captured by Darth Maladi and the Yuuzhan Vong who helped her sabotage the Ossus Project. Maladi was developing a new weapon to increase her power in the Sith, and needed Cade to use his healing powers to see that they were invincible. Therefore, Maladi had infected Deliah Blue with her weapon and told Cade to use his dark side healing powers to try to heal her. Cade tried, and was unable, while continually dancing on the edge of the dark side. As Maladi continued to taunt him, Cade eventually snapped and used his powers to force the Sith mistress to see her worst fears. Terrified, Maladi fled and activated her lab's self-destruct sequence.\nCade continued to try to use his healing powers on Blue after Syn and his friends showed up, Wolf Sazen among them. While Cade insisted that the dark side was stronger, Sazen told him to tap into the light side to save Blue. Cade told everyone else to leave before the base blew up while he continued to heal Blue. Cade tapped into the light side and his love for Blue, which caused Maladi's weapon to die, freeing her. Cade carried Blue out of the destroyed lab, and told Sazen that he had been right.\nDespite this, Cade decided not to return to the Jedi. Saying that the Force had made him what he was, he decided to be neutral; neither Jedi nor Sith, but the latter's worst enemy.\nAfter learning of the poisoning of Dac by the Sith scientist Vul Isen, Cade, alongside Wolf Sazen, Deliah and Jariah, made his way to Daluuj to hunt down the so-called \"Butcher of Dac\" and deal a crippling blow to the Sith. Cade and his companions confronted a number of stormtroopers as well as several Sith. After defeating them, Cade interrogated the surviving Sith as to Isen's whereabouts, and the Sith said Isen had left a long time ago with all his poisons. Cade then left the wounded Sith in the lab for dead, had Jariah set the lab to explode, and then left Daluuj with his group.\nAfter the mission, Luke's Force ghost appeared to Cade once again, this time saying that he needed to form his plans better if he was to succeed against the Sith. Around this time, Cade got a message from Jool's summoning him to Nal Hutta: the Sith, under Isen, had bombarded and poisoned the sacred Hutt world of Da Soocha in an attempt to punish the Hutts for providing a refuge for Mon Calamari. After hearing this, Cade and his crew set a course for Nal Hutta.\nBy coincidence, Cade and company ran into Screeger again, who had got himself hired as the gatekeeper for Jool's associate, Vedo Anjiliac Atirue. Screeger then pulled a trap against Cade, separating him from his friends by a literal wall. Cade was forced to defeat all the combat droids set against him, before he came face-to-face with Vedo and Jool, who had set up the entire fight to test his skills. Vedo then cut straight to the point: Isen had murdered his nephew Azzim and wanted the Sith scientist to pay. Therefore, to make it seemed like the Hutt clan was cowed by the destruction of Napdu and Da Soocha, he had leaked to the Sith that Gar Stazi was hiding on Utapau, which would entice Isen to go there to attempt to use his poisons, putting him in the perfect position to be eliminated. However, Stazi could not be warned, for then Isen would flee.\nThe crew of the Mynock then arrived on Utapau, under the pretense of selling Rawk chopped specials to the Alliance Remnant. Cade and Sazen departed the others' company to meet up with Vedo's agent, Pobos. But before the Bothan could tell him anything, he was shot by assassins. Cade and Sazen were able to defeat the assassins, before the former used the Force to keep Pobos alive long enough for him to disclose Isen's location. Sazen then quickly realized that Cade was willing to go along with the Hutts' plan. Though Cade said that he didn't care if Stazi lived or died, Sazen reprimanded him for such thinking, stating that Stazi and his forces had been fighting the Sith for seven years. He asked his former apprentice if he thought he could defeat the Sith all by himself. He demanded that Cade warned Stazi or he would. Cade complied, contacting Syn to guard Stazi, but to trust no one.\nIsen's assassin was killed by Syn and Blue managed to protect Stazi. Meanwhile, Cade and Sazen found Darth Azard and Isen. While Sazen dueled Azard, Cade went after Isen. Cade cornered Isen on a ledge, but then felt a horrible disturbance in the Force: Darth Krayt had returned from the dead. Isen used the opportunity to leap into the pit with a virus that would destroy all of Utapau. Cade leapt after him, sliced him in half in mid-air, and caught the virus's container before it could hit the water and shatter, saving the planet. But when Cade fell in the water, the Force gave him a vision of the future: he was fighting a reborn Darth Krayt, and there was nothing after it. Climbing out of the water, Cade realized that the Force had shaped him over his entire life for one destiny: to stop Darth Krayt.\nCade informed Sazen about his vision, and Sazen told the Jedi Council that Krayt was alive. Later, Cade began having visions of himself killing Sazen and his uncle under Krayt's orders. Cade told Sazen about this, and Sazen said that despite rejecting the Sith, Cade was still drawn to the dark side. He also told him that the Jedi Council was only listening to him partly because Sazen was vouching for him, and partly because any possibility that Krayt was alive should be taken seriously. However, Cade believed that the Jedi weren't going to do anything and left with Jariah and Deliah. Cade, Jariah and Deliah talked about Cade's plans to stop Krayt. Although they did not understand the Force, Jariah and Deliah promised to help Cade in his plans.\nCade Skywalker and his companions then traveled to Falleen and attacked the Imperial cruiser Krayt had sent to bombard the planet. They were joined by Rogue Squadron, sent by Admiral Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant in defense of the planet. After boarding the cruiser, Cade received a transmission from his mother telling him that they needed to meet on The Wheel in three days. After tossing explosives into the cruiser's reactor core, Cade sent a transmission to Krayt, promising to kill the Dark Lord once more and for good. With Falleen secured, Cade and his allies followed Rogue Squadron back to Stazi's fleet.\nUnknown to Cade, his journey to kill Krayt was actually playing right into the Sith's hands. Krayt wanted Cade to find him so he could undergo what he had endured at Wyyrlok's hands: 'death' and rebirth. Krayt believed that this would force Cade to serve him.\nCade and his friends arrived at the Wheel, only to find it in ruins due to an Imperial attack after the owner tried to enforce his 'no weapons' rule. The three arrived at Corde's quarters, and after waiting for a while met a dying Calixte. Syn and Blue attacked her, but Calixte revealed that she and Corde were one and the same. Cade sensed she was telling the truth, and asked his friends to leave them alone. Calixte told Cade that she didn't expect forgiveness for her actions, but that she was trying to make amends for them. Calixte told him that she had been discovered as Fel's spy and poisoned by Morlish Veed, but had still managed to escape. In response, Cade told her that he couldn't heal her because he only ever healed Blue with the light side, and that worked because he immensely loved her. At that point, Kol appeared and convinced Cade to try to save his mother. Cade tried, but his memories of her past misdeeds started to push him to the dark side. Kol managed to calm Cade by telling him to forgive Calixte, as he already had. This, combined with seeing his parents reaffirm that they loved each other, convinced Cade to forgive his mother and he successfully healed her with the light side.\nWith a recovered Corde officially joining the crew, Cade and his companions prepared to leave the Wheel. But as they were boarding the Mynock, they were greeted by Darth Talon. She said Krayt had gotten his message, and sent her with one of his own. She said it was in his ship and departed. The group entered the Mynock to find Antares Draco frozen in carbonite. After thawing him out, they were informed of what had happened to the Imperial Knight: he had infiltrated Korriban to rescue Princess Fel, been captured by his fallen master, and broken into revealing the location of the Jedi's temple on Taivas. Cade sent a priority message to Taivas and immediately set course for the temple.\nCade arrived at the temple and was summoned by the Council. The council was discussing with Admiral Stazi and Roan Fel on how to respond to the situation. Stazi and Fel recommended the Jedi evacuate, but Cade said doing so would only allow the Sith to slaughter them without a fight. Cade mentioned that Taivas was a natural fortress against orbital bombardment, and suggested they lure the Sith-Imperial forces into a trap. The combined leaders agreed on this, and the allies at the temple prepared for the coming attack.\nWhen the combined Sith-Imperial armada arrived, it took casualties due to friendly fire because of Taivas' magnetic field disabling their auto-targeting systems. This forced the Sith-Imperials to engage the Jedi on the ground. Cade took part in the battle when the Sith attempted to storm the temple. During the fight, Cade recounciled with his uncle, who had decided to return to the Jedi until Krayt was defeated. When Cade and Nat were satisfied that the Sith-Imperials were engaged in the battle, they sprung the trap: sending a private signal, the Jedi summoned the Galactic Alliance and Fel Empire fleets to Taivas, trapping the Sith-Imperials on all sides.\nHowever, what the allies at Taivas didn't know was that Krayt had foreseen their maneuver, and made arrangements for this to work in his favor. Just when victory for the allied forces seemed assured, Krayt played his secret trump card: a fleet of new Sith troopers, led by Darth Nihl, dropped out of hyperspace and joined the battle. The allies were surprised at the new arrivals, and took heavy casualties from them. The troopers joined the battle both in the air and on the ground, destroying anything that stood in their way to the Jedi Temple, even the Sith-Imperial forces who weren't able to escape their path.\nCade, like everyone else, was shocked by the new Sith troopers, but he still believed their plan to deal Krayt's empire a serious blow could work. The order to evacuate the temple was given, and the ships that made up the temple detached and set a course for Bastion, accompanied by the Alliance Remnant, loyalist Imperials and a number of recent Sith-Imperial defectors. Cade remained behind to protect the allies' secret weapon: T'ra Saa. As a Sith ship made a collision course run on the remains of the temple, Cade thought he wasn't going to make it. But Nat pushed him out a open window and then helped T'ra Saa set off her stored force energy, taking any Sith caught in the blast with them.\nCade was deeply shaken by his uncle's demise, and took his rage out on a group of Sith Troopers who managed to get on board the Mynock, even tapping into the dark side to gain the advantage. But Corde managed to convince Cade to keep one of the troopers alive so they could find a weakness in Krayt's newest weapon. As the Mynock headed for Bastion, Cade was tended to by Deliah Blue, who also comforted him as he mourned the loss of his uncle.\nUnknown to Cade, Roan Fel was now willing to betray him; having been pushed beyond his limits with the defeat at Taivas, the Emperor turned to a captured Darth Maladi and agreed to her offer of assistance: her Omega Red virus for her right to kill Cade.\nWhile the Alliance and the Empire took refuge in Bastion, Cade heard about the allies' plans to attack Coruscant. He talked with Jariah and admitted that he blamed himself for the deaths in Taivas. However, Jariah said that the soldiers on Taivas died because they chose to fight. Shaking off his doubts, Cade decided to join the attack.\nThe Mynock transported a strike team to Coruscant. The strike team included Cade, Wolf Sazen, Shado Vao, Rasi Tuum, Sigel Dare, Ganner Krieg, Azlyn Rae and Morrigan Corde. Deliah and Jariah stayed on the Mynock while Cade and the strike team began the attack. Morrigan separated from the group and killed Morlish Veed, while Cade and the team fought against a group of Sith.\nCade fought against Darth Talon again, and managed to pin her down. However, Wolf and Darth Stryfe killed each other, and Wolf became one with the Force. Cade was outraged by his former master's death, and Talon ran off to warn Krayt about Cade's growing power. Vao ordered Cade to chase after Talon, and he did.\nCade confronted Krayt and the two engaged in battle. During the duel, Skywalker was injured to the point of death and saw Krayt's vision of the future which involved Coruscant burning, and Cade becoming his slave and then his host body. After returning from death, Cade announced that he now knew his place in the galaxy, summoned his lightsaber and killed Darth Krayt, proclaiming himself a Jedi.\nCade, however, knew that Krayt would revive himself. So, Cade told his mother his plan to take her ship and fly it straight into Coruscant's sun, destroying himself and Krayt's body. Grief-stricken but understanding, her mother gave him a locket that contained a holo of herself, Cade and his father.\nAs he flew the ship to the sun, Cade had a discussion with Krayt's spirit, who said that if his body was destroyed, he would use Cade's body to return. However, Cade remained resolute. Suddenly, the spirit of Luke Skywalker appeared to him. Luke urged Cade to accept hope and not to let fear shape his life. Accepting his ancestor's guidance, Cade escaped the ship before it collided with the sun and went into a Jedi healing trance.\nSuddenly, Deliah and Jariah appeared with the Mynock and R2-D2 took him into the ship. The locket his mother had given him contained a tracer that allowed Deliah and Jariah to find him. Believing Cade to be dead, Deliah began to cry and professed her love for him, after which Cade woke up from his trance. Reunited with his friends, Cade set course for a distant place where they could be in peace. When Jariah asked him where would they go, Cade replied that they would go forward, reciting the Jedi Code.\nFollowing the defeat of the One Sith and their Galactic Empire, a new Galactic Federation Triumvirate, consisting of the Imperial court, the Jedi High Council, and the Galactic Alliance was formed. By 140 ABY, Cade Skywalker and his companions Deliah Blue and Jariah Syn were traveling through the galaxy. That year, Cade and Deliah were present at a cantina when Syn was dealing with a Mon Calamari engineer named Sauk, who was trying to procure a stabilizing coil for his companion, the assassin droid AG-37's freighter. While Sauk was unhappy at having to fork out a large amount of credits to pay for the coil, he reluctantly agreed to buy it after Jariah pointed out that it was difficult to obtain a new coil in this star system. Cade and his companions were delighted at their successful transaction, which came at an opportune moment for Sauk and his friends. Shortly later, Sauk and his companions AG-37, the junk dealer Ania Solo, and the former Imperial Knight Jao Assam were attacked.\nCade was known for his independent nature and his utter adverseness to having others sacrifice themselves for him. Like his ancestor Anakin Skywalker before him, Cade was reckless, headstrong, and often led by his emotions. He walked a fragile line between the light and dark sides of the Force, frequently unnerving his friends and Jedi companions with displays of his dark side abilities, while also frustrating his former master, Darth Krayt, with his resilience against the lure of the dark side's power. This resilience, however, impressed Celeste Morne, who said she had never met someone who walked so close to the dark side and yet was so resistant to its lure.\nFurthermore, Cade exhibited a lack of respect for others  to the point where he would openly mock them in public.\nCade was also, again like Anakin Skywalker, unwilling to let those he cared about go. His constant use of his healing powers to keep people from dying, like Azlyn Rae and Deliah Blue, was proof of this.\nOnce Cade began to re-embrace the light side he decided to bring war to the Sith. Later after experiencing a vision of him and Darth Krayt in one final duel he realized that it was his destiny to stop Krayt. Cade's return to the light also brought about a more compassionate change in him. This was demonstrated by his forgiveness of his mother and the mourning for his uncle's demise on Taivas.\nBut perhaps his most incredible achievement that marked his return to the light side was that he withstood the corrupting powers Krayt used to try to force him down the dark side and stayed true to his Jedi heritage.\nAs a member of the Skywalker family, Cade had a naturally strong connection to the Force, and was immensely powerful in its use.\nAs a Padawan, Cade showed incredible potential in the ways of the Force, being able to hold his own against a large number of stormtroopers and Sith during the Massacre at Ossus even though he was a simple child still in training. Cade was skilled in the use of the hibernation trance, which he used on at least two occasions, once after the Massacre of Ossus and again after the Battle of Coruscant.\nHis powers did not appear to atrophy in the seven years he spent in Rav's crew, despite rarely drawing on his powers in that time and his use of deathsticks. During a confrontation with Darth Talon on Vendaxa, Cade used the Force to hurl a crashed starship at the Sith, once more tapping into his anger to fuel his abilities. He later admitted that he could sense the Sith nearby, showing that his Jedi senses were as attuned as ever. When he attempted to rescue Hosk from the Temple of the Sith on Coruscant, he was able to sense the Jedi's presence from outside the mammoth structure.\nHe was proficient with telekinesis, capable of using a very powerful Force push, on many occasions, like in the Sith temple on Coruscant against Darth Talon, where he threw the Sith Lady back with a powerful kinetic blast, injuring her .\nHe could also use Force choke, a dark side power associated with the Sith, which he used against Gunn Yage After his training with the Sith, Cade became proficient in the use of Force lightning beyond his untrained talents. The voltage of his lightning was strong enough to injure a Hand-class Sith like Darth Nihl and defeat an elite Sith Trooper.\nWhen Cade went to reclaim the Grinning Liar, Rav ordered all of his henchmen to attack Cade, and while greatly outnumbered, Cade singlehandedly defeated all of them.\nWhen Darth Maladi set her base on Wayland to self-destruct, Cade was able to project a protection bubble over himself and Deliah Blue to protect them from the explosion and its residual effects. Cade once used a Force scream that impressed Darth Krayt.\nPerhaps his most impressive and mysterious power was his apparently instinctive ability to create and use Dark transfer, which allowed him to revive Wolf Sazen from death. To do so, Cade tapped into the power of the dark side, and both he and Sazen felt the effect as Force lightning coursed over their bodies. The power he exerted even caused Cade's eyes to glow with Force energy. Within moments, Sazen had been revived, and he was soon able to talk and walk of his own accord. As Cade would later relate to Sazen some seven years later, the price for bringing his Master back from death was high: Cade admitted he \"tapped into all the fear and rage\" within him, and, as he told the Force ghost of Luke Skywalker, he was afraid that the hunger for power he felt that day was \"not a good place for a Skywalker to be\". Cade could also use this to purge other ailments from other beings bodies.\nCade's use of the dark side was even felt by Darth Krayt, from the New Imperial Palace on Coruscant. Krayt believed that this power would enable him to cheat death, and began a search for what he called \"a dark light in the Force\". Cade's ability to tap into the Force was so powerful that he was able to manifest and control Force lightning to such a degree that he was able to prevent his ship from being torn apart by a large lightning storm ravaging the entire planet. Cade later learned to use Dark transfer in coordination with the light side of the Force, which was apparently what was needed to overcome previous obstacles to its healing powers.\nIn addition to being able to heal people with his power, it could be used to hurt others that suffered a previous injury in moments, by allowing Cade to focus it into a point where their wound was, by finding shatterpoints. Either healing or injuring someone with his Force ability, he can completely manipulate someone's body.\nUltimately, Cade managed to find the ability that his ancestor, Anakin Skywalker, had desired for so long—to keep people from dying, especially those whom the user loved.\nLike his ancestors before him, Cade was very skilled in the art of lightsaber combat, defeating numerous Sith and Stormtroopers to escape the Massacre at Ossus. Abandoning the Order, Cade swore never to pick up a lightsaber again. When Princess Fel was wounded attempting to save Cade several years later, he took up her lightsaber and without practice, attacked and stove off Darth Nihl, one of Darth Krayt's Hands.\nAfter participating in further Jedi training, Cade went to Coruscant to rescue Hosk Trey'lis and dueled Krayt's other Hand, Darth Talon. He managed to disarm her, only to be subdued by Nihl. Cade was then trained in the ways of the Sith before attempting an escape, deafeating both Darths Talon and Nihl. He then dueled Darth Krayt, holding the Dark Lord off until his mother could provide a method of escape. Cade would continue to display his skills with a lightsaber on Had Abbadon, where he once again defeated Darth Talon and Krayt's new hand, Darth Stryfe. Cade along with Wolf Sazen fought and killed several Sith on the planet Daluuj, including a Sith Lord who claimed to have already killed powerful Jedi. Cade also dueled Vul Isen, the butcher of Dac, and killed him.\nAfter Darth Krayt's return Cade openly fought against Sith, slaying stormtroopers as well as an attacking Sith during the Bombing of Falleen. Cade easily defeated many attacking Sith when they attacked the Hidden Temple and later, when Darth Krayt's Sith troopers were unleashed, Cade managed to kill several of them despite their advanced abilities. After a fierce duel, Cade fully embraced the light side and struck down the Darth Krayt during the Battle of Coruscant.\nCade was able equal in his lightsaber abilities with the leader of the Imperial Knight, Antares Draco. When Cade was on Tatooine he fought the Anzat bounty hunter Sint Yoru, in which the Anzat brandished a lightsaber he claimed to have obtain from a Jedi he hunted and killed. Cade declared that the only difference between them was skill, and killed the Anzati with one strike.\nWhen engaged in lightsaber combat, Cade frequently utilized leaping and acrobatic maneuvers in his bladework. Cade also used Force powers in conjunction with his lightsaber, making him twice as deadly in battle.\nIn addition to his Force powers, Cade was a capable starfighter pilot, being able to ditch Skull Squadron, some of Darth Krayt's best pilots, when he was attempting to rescue Trey'lis. He was also proficient in both hand-to-hand combat and ranged combat with his weapon of choice, the Rawk chopped special.\n\nAs a Jedi Padawan, he used a blue lightsaber. During his self-exile, Cade used Marasiah Fel's lightsaber after she saved him from a Sith. After he left Deliah Blue and Jariah Syn on Vendaxa, he went to Ossus, where he was armed with a green lightsaber when he battled a vision of Darth Vader. After he met Nei Rin, Rin gave him his father's lightsaber, which he brought with him to Coruscant. After his capture, it was seized by Darth Krayt. It was later recovered by Cade after his father's Force ghost appeared to him. He used the Force to shatter the transparisteel his father's lightsaber was encased in, and used it to fight the Sith.In his pirate years, Cade also had a collection of antique and modified blasters, his favorite being the Rawk chopped special, a custom double-barreled blaster carbine built for him by a chief mechanic of the Selonian Shipyards, and his own uncle, Nat Skywalker, then going by the alias \"Bantha\" Rawk. Because of a recognition code programmed in it, the blaster only worked for Cade and no one else. His armor chest piece was Mandalorian in origin. He also wore trousers that resemble those worn by Darth Vader.\nDeliah was Cade's companion and primary love interest. Cade's interest in Deliah was usually playful and sexual. Deliah would help him through his troubled times such as his death sticks usage or loss of people he cared about. Cade's relationship with Deliah would later grow into love; he would go as far to risk himself to save her from Maladi's weapon and he would finally admit his love for her.\nBefore Deliah, Cade and Azlyn were close during their Jedi training on Ossus. They developed feelings for one another and kissed on at least one occasion. They met again years later and slowly rekindled their relationship. When Rae was badly injured by Celeste Morne, Cade tried to keep her alive. Though he managed to have a cyborg suit made for her, she was angry at Cade for not letting her die. Their relationship ended after that.\nCade and Talon were enemies at the beginning and briefly became allies during his time among the Sith. Cade would pretend to be a Sith and Talon would be his master. They had a bond when Cade healed her and the two became close. They shared some moments of passion, though she had sensed Cade's deception. Cade turned on the Sith and Talon eventually become his enemy again.\nIn early iterations of the Star Wars script, the character that became Anakin Skywalker had the first name \"Kane\". An action figure of Cade was released in 2008 as part of Hasbro's Comic Pack line, paired with Darth Talon. Jan Duursema has indicated that Cade was born in the year 116 ABY, but this has never been confirmed in canon.\nBesides the fifty–issue Star Wars: Legacy comic series, Cade Skywalker also made a brief cameo appearance in the last issue of Corinna Bechko and Gabriel Hardman's Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2, the second iteration of the Legacy comic series. For that scene, he was drawn by Brian Albert Thies, colored by Jordan Boyd, and designed by Rick DeLucco.",
