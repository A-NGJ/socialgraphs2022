 "content": "Lugh was a Gamorrean and second warlord of the Bolgoink clan. He was dark green with yellow eyes and was considered thin by Gamorrean standards. The years of military campaigning resulted in nocked ears and numerous facial scars. Lugh was in command of the clan tuskers and was responsible for the security of the main fortress.\nHe used to be married to one of Kufbrug's daughters before her death in 11 BBY.",
