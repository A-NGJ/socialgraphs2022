 "content": "Shil Kaval was a Human male criminal who was a citizen of Athar on the planet JanFathal during the Clone Wars. In 22 BBY, he and his girlfriend Merish Hath met with Orla Taman, who was revealed to be an undercover agent of the Galactic Republic. Together, they participated, along with local rebels, in an uprising against the Republic-aligned Regent of the planet. When Devis's position as a spy was revealed, Kaval, along with Varti and Hath took her hostage. When the Republic strike team arrived to rescue Devis, Kaval was shot by Captain Rex.",
