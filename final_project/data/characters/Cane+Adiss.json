 "content": "Cane Adiss was a Yuvernian male who was in the crime lord Jabba the Hutt's palace on the planet Tatooine during the rescue of the smuggler Han Solo while he was in carbonite, in 4 ABY.\nIn 4 ABY, when Leia Organa came to Jabba's Palace dressed as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh, she handed over Solo's Wookiee companion Chewbacca as part of the rescue mission. Adiss stood and watched as Chewbacca was taken by Gamorreans. When Organa snuck into Jabba's audience chamber, and freed Solo, she was caught by Jabba as he anticipated she would free Solo. As the curtains drew back, a group of patrons including Cane Adiss stood behind her as the two were taken away. The next day, he was aboard the Khetanna when Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were to be thrown into the Great Pit of Carkoon. He was a part of Jabba's criminal empire.\nAdiss had blue eyes and yellow skin.\nCane Adiss appeared in the 1983 Star Wars movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. He was later identified in 2016 by the mobile app Star Wars: Card Trader. The character was first named in the Star Wars Legends continuity in the \"Jabba's Palace Limited\" set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in 1998.\nA prototype maquette of the character was created for the film, and differed from the final puppet in that the green-spotted head had a large crest above it rather than protrusions, while the other head had orange rather than brown spots. Constructing the final puppet required scaffolding. Revealed during a panel for Salt Lake Comic-Con, the production name for Cane Adiss was \"Cane Heads.\"",
