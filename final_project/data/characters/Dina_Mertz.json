 "content": "Dina Mertz was a female Human chief tech officer in Cularin system's criminal Organization. She was a pretty young girl who tied her hair in two bouncing but stiff tails that looked similar to lekku.\nShe worked for Nirama's organization in the asteroid space station Darkside, in the Cularin system asteroid belt.\nIn 31 BBY, she received smuggler Xav Verivax, who tried to flirt with her. She then took a team of undercover agents who had came in Verivax's ship to see her boss, Vin Tal'benes.\nMertz was not as grumpy as most of the people in Darkside, but she was not really extrovert either.",
