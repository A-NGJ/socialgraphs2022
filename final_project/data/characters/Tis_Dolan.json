 "content": "Tis Dolan was a Wroonian female and the de facto leader of the Anjiliac clan operations on the shadowport Point Nadir.\nAn ambitious Wroonian female, Tis Dolan fled her enemies on Wroona to make a name for herself. She briefly worked with a group of Twi'lek thieves, but her opportunity came when she met Zietta Anjiliac in the shadowport Point Nadir. Zietta was incompetent compared to other Hutts and was a disgrace of her kajidic. Dolan decided to make her place in Point Nadir hierarchy through Zietta, and for that she gained Zietta's confidence, even though she despised her. Then she used her last money to engineer the assassination of Zietta's cousin, Tirello Anjiliac, the boss of Point Nadir. Then, Dolan organized Zietta's rise to power, helping her establish control of the Point Nadir. In truth, Zietta remained nothing but a puppet in hands of Tis Dolan, who made the majority of the decisions and manipulated the Hutt to her own ends, fighting to maintain that position.\nTis was a petite Wroonian who wore sharp business attire. She was terse and to the point, and could be vindictive that would border on obsession. She had blue skin, violet eyes, and blue-black hair that she wore braided into a queue. She could speak Basic, Bothese, Cerean, Durese, Houkese, Huttese, Ryl, and Sullustese.\nAn accomplished combatant, Dolan was known to possess exceptional piloting and gun skills.",
