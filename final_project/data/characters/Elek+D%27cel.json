 "content": "Elek D'cel was a skilled Caamasi male diplomat who had been offworld when Caamas was destroyed. Returning to his homeworld, he became both founder and administrator of Refuge City, an active reclamation project that had been intended to return Caamas to a livable state. Adorned in a shimmersilk noble's outfit and a full-length cloak, D'cel always had a breath mask at hand, as he frequently left Refuge City to take long, reflective strolls in the barrens beyond the compound. Like all Caamasi, he rarely lost his composure; but when the strain of managing every aspect of the Refuge City reclamation Project began to get to him, he had a nervous habit of twitching his nose furtively and flexing his fingers in apprehension.",
