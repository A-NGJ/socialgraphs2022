 "content": "A Zygerrian guard operated under the Zygerrian Slave Empire during the early days of the Imperial Era. The guard served under Raney in Old Ord Mantell City on Ord Mantell. After Jabba's pet rancor, Muchi, was kidnapped by the slavers, Cid sent out Clone Force 99 to rescue Muchi. The mission failed, as almost all of Clone Force 99 was captured, except for Omega. Omega, trying to free her team from captivity, tried to release Muchi, but this guard stopped her and dragged her over to Raney. The guard claimed that she was sneaking around, only for Omega to remark she wasn't sneaking, but unlocking Muchi's cage. The guard and two other Zygerrians tried to hold down the cage doors, but failed as Muchi escaped and caused havoc amongst the Zygerrian slavers. Clone Force 99 then saved the other slaves and escaped with Muchi, giving him to Bib Fortuna to take back to Jabba the Hutt.\nThe Zygerrian guard appeared in \"Rampage,\" the fifth episode of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on May 28, 2021. He was portrayed by Sam Riegel.",
