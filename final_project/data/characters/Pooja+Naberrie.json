 "content": "Pooja Naberrie was a human female from Naboo whose mother was Sola Naberrie; she also had a sister, Ryoo. She attended the funeral of her aunt, Padmé Amidala, in 19 BBY.\nPooja Naberrie was a human female whose mother was Sola Naberrie, a member of the Naberrie family from the planet Naboo; she also had a sister named Ryoo. She was a child when the Clone Wars ended in 19 BBY, the same year that her aunt, Padmé Amidala, died in childbirth. Naberrie attended Amidala's funeral ceremony in the capital city of the Naboo homeworld, shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire.\nNaberrie had brown curly hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nAt times, Naberrie wore an elegant, traditional children's dress made from natural materials. At her aunt's funeral, she wore a black dress to show her mourning.\nPooja Naberrie was played by the actress Hayley Mooy. She first appeared in a deleted scene in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones that was set at the Naboo family residence. She appears at the end of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith attending Padmé Amidala's funeral and is named in the film's closing credits.",
