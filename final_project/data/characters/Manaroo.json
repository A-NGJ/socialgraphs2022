 "content": "Manaroo was an Aruzan female who dated the bounty hunter Dengar during the Imperial Era. At some point, she became indebted to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, who made her his prisoner and used her as leverage against Dengar. Should he manage to capture his fellow bounty hunter Boba Fett, Manaroo would be freed; otherwise, she'd be fed to Jabba's pet rancor. After Manaroo had ceased to be Jabba's prisoner, Dengar got into trouble in the Vergesso Asteroids, leaving Manaroo in control of his JumpMaster 5000, the Punishing One.\nManaroo contacted a group of spacers via identity-scrambled comms and arranged to meet them on the outskirts of Mos Entha, on the planet Tatooine. Shortly after the spacers arrived, she landed the Punishing One nearby and met them at the hatch of the starship, imploring the group to aid her in rescuing Dengar.\nIn the new Star Wars canon, Manaroo was first mentioned the in the Punishing One Expansion Pack for the Star Wars: X-Wing Second Edition miniatures game. She originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where she was created by Dave Wolverton for the 1996 short story Payback: The Tale of Dengar, which was published in the Tales of the Bounty Hunters anthology.",
