 "content": "Sparky was a male Human mechanic from the planet Artorias.\nHe was working to repair the comm interlink in the Artorias communications center at the beginning of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. While he was struggling to fix the interlink, he was interrupted by a cloaked man who offered to help him finish the job, commenting that he did not like the idea of Artorias being cut off from the rest of the galaxy.\nFrustrated at his work, Sparky accepted his offer but told the man to tell everyone else that he was the one who fixed it since that his was job. The man proceeded to apparently fix the interlink and also received a distress signal from the crew of the exploration ship Pythea. The Chiss female explorer Panha warned him of the danger of an approaching Yuuzhan Vong fleet. The man told them that their message had been received but did not tell Sparky about the message.\nSparky was then told by the cloaked man that his attempts had also failed. Unaware of Panha's distress signal and the impending Yuuzhan Vong invasion, he commented that there was nothing wrong with his planet being left in the dark. However, the cloaked man removed his form-concealing ooglith masquer; revealing himself to be a hidden Yuuzhan Vong advance agent.\nAfter the Battle of Artorias Sparky joined with Caled Galfridian in the Artorias resistance.",
