 "content": "\"Redeye\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars as a part of the 501st Legion. Redeye was killed along with his friend Mixer on the Coronet while fighting against Senator Tal Merrik's SD-K4 assassin probes.\nAs a clone, Redeye stood 1.83 meters tall and had black hair, brown eyes and tan skin. Between Redeye and Mixer, Redeye showed more caution and seriousness than Mixer, who was more lighthearted about their mission onboard the Coronet. Redeye was also shown to be nervous about missions in the dark, a subject Mixer teased him about during their mission.\nRedeye wielded a DC-15A blaster carbine while onboard the Coronet. Additionally, he wore Phase I clone trooper armor and had a pair of flashlights affixed to his helmet. His arm plates bore unique blue stripes marking him as a member of the 501st Legion, and his helmet was customized with a personalized logo and a blue triangle marking centered on his helmet.\nRedeye first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Voyage of Temptation,\" which aired on February 5, 2010. Like all clone troopers in the series, he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.",
