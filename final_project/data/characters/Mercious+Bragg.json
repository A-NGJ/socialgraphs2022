 "content": "Mercious Bragg was a Human male who served as a sergeant in the Intelligence Division of the Royal Naboo Security Forces during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a section of Theed fell victim to a terrorist attack. Sergeant Bragg, who often conducted business in the capital's local cantina, was tasked with discovering the identity of the culprits. With the help of a trooper loyal to the RSF, Bragg investigated the headquarters of the four major criminal organization on Naboo, namely the Skaak Tippers, Borvo the Hutt's criminal empire, the Darkwalkers and the Mummers. Sergeant Bragg eventually concluded that the Mummers were responsible for the attack. Following this revelation, the Royal Naboo Security forces conducted a raid on the Mummer bunker, neutralizing the Mummer's ability to enact future terror attacks.\nMercious Bragg was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mercious Bragg was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
