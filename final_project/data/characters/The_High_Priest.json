 "content": "The High Priest was a male Lorrdian who was the leader of a congregation of the Brotherhood of the Beatific Countenance. As a result of taking his faiths concealment of individuality to heart, he even stripped himself of a name and was only referred to by his followers by a keening wail of specific pitch. The High Priest was present in Jedha City on the moon Jedha shortly before the city was destroyed by the Galactic Empire's Death Star. Whilst on Jedha, the High Priest wore a Lorrdian Cowl of Quiescence and the Blue Gown of the Sullen Moon.\nThe High Priest was portrayed by Al Derado Safin in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
