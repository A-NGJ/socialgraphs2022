 "content": "Feskitt Bobb was a Mandallian Giant who operated as a mercenary and bounty hunter during the early years of the Galactic Civil War. Originally a member of Tobbi Dala and Fenn Shysa's covert police training program on the planet Mandalore, Bobb washed out of the program with the Togorian female Alfreda Goot. Bobb acquired a set of supercommando armor and became a freelance blaster-for-hire. His most notable accomplishment was the capture of the serial killer Kardem. Bobb's career was ended on the planet Goratak III when he was contracted by the Galactic Empire to assist in the recovery of an I2-CG droid. An Alliance Special Operations agent named Jodo Kast killed Bobb, believing at the time that he was the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett.\nFeskitt Bobb was a Mandallian Giant male who, along with the Togorian Alfreda Goot, washed out of the elite police training program established on the planet Mandalore by Tobbi Dala and Fenn Shysa. Despite this, Bobb assembled a set of supercommando armor and became a mercenary and bounty hunter, undertaking special assignments on behalf of the Galactic Empire. Competent and ruthless, he had no trouble using torture methods such as the Burning during his hunts and even carried illegal disruptors. Bobb's most high-profile capture was the serial killer Kardem, who was, in reality, the fallen Jedi Vydel Dir'Nul.\nSometime prior to 0 BBY, Imperial Intelligence contracted Bobb and nine other bounty hunters to assist in the recovery of an I2-CG droid that had ejected from a Plexus Droid Vessel over the planet Goratak III while carrying information on an Alliance to Restore the Republic starfighter manufacturing operation on the planet Tar Morden. The bounty hunters were used to augment the Imperial force of two cold assault stormtrooper squads. The Alliance sent in a force of three squads to obtain the droid, assisted by the ex-pirate captain Grindol Maal and Wuwuhuul, a Thuwisten of the Tyia. The two forces clashed for control of the droid. During the engagement, Bobb was killed by Alliance Special Operations soldier Jodo Kast, who believed that Bobb was the notorious bounty hunter Boba Fett. After killing Bobb, Kast realized that anyone mistaken for Fett would have a tremendous advantage as a freelance bounty hunter; Kast took Bobb's armor and defected from the Alliance to begin his own bounty hunting career.\nFeskitt Bobb had bluish-green skin and white eyes. He was an accomplished bounty hunter with a ruthless streak that led him to pursue torture as an effective means of capturing his prey. He was able to capture the serial killer known as Kardem, despite the target's aptitude with the Force. Bobb's personality was ultimately deemed to not be conducive to a role within the Mandalorian Protectors, leading to him being washed out of the training program.\nBobb was trained in a variety of combat skills, including the use of blasters, blaster artillery, and grenades. He was also skilled in both melee and unarmed combat. Bobb was trained in survival techniques and the operation of repulsorlift vehicles, as well as the application of demolitions.\nBobb wore Mandalorian armor with red markings, and he armed himself with a blaster rifle, blaster pistol, grenade launcher, disruptors, and wrist rockets.\nFeskitt Bobb first appeared in \"The Crystal Forest of Goratak,\" an adventure scenario published in the first edition of Star Wars Miniatures Battles, released in 1991. The scenario was reprinted in the second edition release of the book in 1993. In both editions, Bobb was presented simply as a Mandalorian bounty hunter. In 2005's The History of the Mandalorians, published in issue 80 of the Star Wars Insider, Bobb's history was elaborated on, including his species and sex.",
