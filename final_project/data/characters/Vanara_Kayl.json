 "content": "Vanara Kayl was a female Human Senator who represented the people of Coruscant in the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire. She was also in charge of Coruscant's government and led the reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the Sacking of Coruscant. Senator Kayl's actions resulted in many deaths and enslavements in the Old Galactic Market District.\nA Human politician, Vanara Kayl served in the Galactic Republic Senate around 3643 BBY following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire. Part of the Cold War-era Senate, Kayl represented the interests of the people of Coruscant, becoming well-respected and seen as very favorable by her constituents. She led the Coruscant government and was placed in charge of Coruscant's reconstruction efforts.\nHowever, Kayl had used funds from the Migrant Merchants' Guild in order to win the election in exchange for her promise for housing projects for the refugees whose interests the Guild supposedly represented. The Guild attempted to blackmail Kayl as well as attack the skylane network around the Senate Building. Kayl responded by sending a contingent of police officers with the Coruscant Security Force under the command of CSF Chief of Security Captain Winborn. With the assistance of an individual, the CSF were able to prevent the attack. However a recording of Kayl arguing with a leader of the Guild was found. The individual who assisted the CSF confronted her and after some debate called a session of the Senate to disclose her actions. After the session, Kayl resigned from her position.\nVanara Kayl appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Coruscant quest called \"Crisis in Galactic City\". The player can also choose to destroy the recording. This article assumes the player made the light side choice.",
