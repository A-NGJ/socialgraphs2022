 "content": "Skaelor Tay was a male Bothan who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he was part of a group of slicers that was based in a building not far from Nym's Stronghold, on the planet of Lok. The group also included Kelson Sharphorn and Byd Chillings. He was armed with a Striker pistol.\nIn 1 ABY, he narrowly escaped potential injuries or death when the Corellian technology-hating Meatlump terrorists planted an explosive device in the slicers' house. A spacer who had infiltrated the Meatlump gang found the bomb in time and defused it.\nSkaelor Tay was a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nSkaelor Tay and the Lok slicers were added to the game with the update dubbed \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008. Skaelor Tay and other slicer NPCs were not part of any quest but they were indirectly involved in the so-called \"Meatlumps Theme Park\". In the basement of the Slicer House, there was a bomb that the player had to defuse as part of the quest \"Muddle the Meatlumps\". While there were several slicer NPC enemies in the house, none of them had to be killed for the mission. \"Chronicle Relics\" could be looted from them. Such relics could be used by players in the Chronicle Quest system to create their own quests for other players. By using the relics related to the slicer NPCs, the quests would task the player with killing Skaelor Tay or other slicers in the house. Tay was a Level 58 Gold Elite NPC, which meant that he was considerably stronger and harder to kill than normal NPCs at this level.",
