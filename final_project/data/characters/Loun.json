 "content": "Loun was a female Sith who held the title of Assistant Overseer at the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. While at the academy she wore red and black armor and carried a lightsaber. Her skin and eyes were both red, while her hair was black.\nIn around 3643 BBY, she carried a message from Overseer Tremel to his new acolyte, informing the warrior that a visit to Overseer Rance for additional training would be a good idea, as Tremel alone could not teach the acolyte all the skills necessary to succeed as a Sith. The acolyte did as asked, and visited Rance to learn new abilities.\nLoun first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game she is a part of the optional quest \"Learning from the Best\" for the Sith Warrior class, which this article assumes players completed as a part of one hundred percent game completion. If the player is a Pureblood Sith male, they can flirt with her and she will agree they are a suitable partner. If a Human male character tries to flirt with her, she says they have a chance with her, but only once they have completed their training.",
