 "content": "Gungus Boga was a male Human member of the Heralds of Zildrog who lived during the Galactic War. By 3630 BBY, he became known as the gladiator \"Noble Executioner\" in the Arena Grand of Zakuul. That year, Boga was put up against a newcomer known as \"the Mysterious Stranger.\" During the fight in the Arena, Gungus was assisted by several of his fellow Heralds of Zildrog, but was defeated in the third round of the Arena fights.\nGungus Boga first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as the third boss of the Eternal Championship event.\nBoga's mask resembles that of the Sith assassin featured in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords.",
