 "content": "Sstrigge was a Trandoshan trader. When the Wookiees and the Rebel Alliance tried to organize Life Day festivities in the cities of Dearic, Wayfar, and Doaba Guerfel in 1 ABY, Sstrigge helped the Galactic Empire disrupt their efforts. He rewarded citizens loyal to the Empire with various rewards for sabotaging the celebrations.\nHe wore parts of Imperial Stormtrooper Forest Camouflage Armor.\nSstrigge was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. During the Life Day live event from December 16, 2008 to January 12, 2009 he could be found in Dearic, Wayfar, and Doaba Guerfel.\nFor stomping and destroying Life Day presents lying in the streets of the cities, players of the Imperial faction were awarded special Imperial Propaganda Tokens that could be redeemed for decorative items by talking to Sstrigge. Rebel-aligned players had to talk to the Wookiee Oolovv instead.",
