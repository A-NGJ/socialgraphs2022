 "content": "Dayana was a female Selonian peacekeeper who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Dayana was present on Corellia were she investigated a group of Drall Patriots, an organization of Drall extremists fighting for the independence of Drall from the Corellian government. In 1 ABY, she tracked them to a warehouse on the outskirts of the city of Doaba Guerfel. Dayana was afraid that the Drall Patriots were using the bunker to plan their future attack. The Selonian therefore recruited an independent spacer who also had worked for the Corellian Security Force. She tasked the spacer to infiltrate the warehouse and download information from their data terminals to discover what they were planning. The spacer eventually returned to Dayana successful and the Selonian ensured that the information gathered would be crucial to stopping the Drall Patriots before they could harm innocent people.\nDayana was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Dayana was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
