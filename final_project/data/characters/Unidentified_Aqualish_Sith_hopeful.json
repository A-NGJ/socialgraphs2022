 "content": "An Aqualish was a Sith student who attended the academy on Korriban. Along with two other Sith prospectors, the Aqualish was supposed to stand where he was and prove himself worthy to enter the academy. He, along with new students, was tasked to stand in one place without food, water, or sleep.\nWhen Revan arrived at the academy, he was angered by the display of cruelty, and decided to save them. Revan told the Aqualish that the Sith weren't for him and asked him to leave the academy. The Aqualish agreed and went home.",
