 "content": "Trask was a male Bothan who lived during the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, which began in 25 ABY. He was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong, an extra-galactic species that invaded the galaxy, and was enslaved to work on a seedship, which was a kind of Yuuzhan Vong freighter. In 27 ABY, Trask suffered a compound ankle fracture that went septic. Jedi Knight Jacen Solo, who was also enslaved by the Yuuzhan Vong, was forced to amputate the Bothan's foot with an amphistaff, an organic Yuuzhan Vong weapon. Trask went into delirium and died five days later.\nTrask appeared in The New Jedi Order: Traitor, a novel in the The New Jedi Order series. Traitor was written by Matthew Stover and published in July 2002.",
