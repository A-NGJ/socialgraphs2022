 "content": "Korkie Kryze, a Mandalorian human male, was a cadet of the Royal Academy of Government on the planet Mandalore during the Clone Wars. A scion of House Kryze, Korkie was born into the Mandalorian political family of his aunt, Duchess Satine Kryze—leader of the New Mandalorians. As civil war spread across the galaxy, fought between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Korkie endeavored to follow in his aunt's career as a leader for the next generation of Mandalore. Though the Mandalorian black market conspiracy was exposed by Korkie and his friends, resulting in the arrest of Prime Minister Almec, the future that he had been groomed for was disrupted by the Death Watch takeover of Mandalore.\nKorkie Kryze was born with a promising future in politics, having been sired by House Kryze—a powerful house in Mandalorian society. As the nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze, leader of the New Mandalorian faction, Korkie followed his aunt's direction by training to become a future leader at the Royal Academy of Government in Sundari, the capital city of Mandalore. Amongst the student body, he counted fellow cadets Amis, Lagos, and Soniee as his friends.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kryze and his classmates were present for a lecture on the correlation of politics and corruption delivered by Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, a guest speaker sent to the Mandalorian homeworld by the High Council of the Jedi Order. Inspired by Tano's teachings, Kryze convinced his friends to follow him as he investigated the shortage of supplies in the capital. However, their search ultimately led them to discover evidence of corruption at the highest level of the Mandalorian government. As a result, they were drawn into Tano's own investigation which revealed that Prime Minister Almec had conspired to increase the planet's trade connections through the black market system. Due to their intervention, Almec was removed from office and sent to prison in light of his illegal operation.\nAs the war progressed throughout the galaxy between the the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Duchess Satine's government was toppled by the Death Watch splinter group and their allies in the Shadow Collective. The Duchess herself was made a prisoner of the new regime, now led by the rogue Sith Lord Maul, which caused Korkie and his old classmates to attempt a jail break in order to free his imprisoned aunt. His plan was supported by his other aunt, Bo-Katan Kryze, who led the Nite Owls in opposition to Maul's leadership. In spite of their efforts, however, Korkie failed to complete the rescue mission. Duchess Satine was recaptured by the Mandalorian super commandos and subsequently executed by Maul, all while Mandalore divided between opposing factions in a new civil war. Despite Satine's capture, Korkie and his cadet comrades were able to escape. By around 9 ABY, Bo-Katan believed she was the last of her line.\nAs a young Mandalorian with a pedigree in the political establishment, Korkie Kryze spent his formative years in preparation for a career in public service. In his time, he represented the best and brightest of his generation, having served as a cadet at the prestigious Royal Academy of Government where Mandalore's future leaders were trained. In addition to the political clout of his family, Kryze's keen intuition and ambitious drive were indicative of his potential to succeed as a future leader on Mandalore.\nAs the nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze, Korkie shared a close relationship with his aunt whom he affectionately referred to as \"Auntie Satine.\" Upon learning of Almec's betrayal, Korkie sought to protect his aunt and sovereign from the Prime Minister. After Death Watch established their control on Mandalore, Korkie remained loyal to his aunt—declaring that he could never betray her.\nKryze was a human male who stood at 1.65 meters. He had blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin.\nKorkie Kryze was first introduced in \"The Academy,\" the sixth episode in Season Three of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. He was portrayed by voice actor Whit Hertford, who reprised the role in the fifth season episode \"The Lawless.\"",
