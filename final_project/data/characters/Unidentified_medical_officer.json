 "content": "A medical officer operated under the Galactic Empire during the early days of the Imperial Era as an administrator, technician, and scientist. Safeguarded by a contingent of Imperial royal guards, she oversaw the Empire's cloning procedures in Mount Tantiss on the planet Weyland. The officer personally welcomed Nala Se to Tantiss after the Kaminoan's own cloning laboratories were decommissioned and promised the alien scientist that the Empire had high hopes for her future. The medical officer was a human female who possessed bangs of long dark hair which she kept in a bun, light skin, and brown eyes. She wore the white uniform of an Imperial scientist as well as a pair of goggles fitted with a communication device.\nThe medical officer first appeared in \"Kamino Lost,\" the finale of the first season of Star Wars: The Bad Batch. She was voiced by actress Helen Sadler. The episode guide for the finale released on StarWars.com drew parallels between the medical officer and Dr. Pershing, a character introduced in the 2019 live-action series The Mandalorian. The guide also revealed concept art for the officer by Angela Chen that was dated to June 25, 2020.",
