 "content": "Nomas was a male Human who ran a salvage yard during the Galactic Civil War. Nomas was overly talkative on occasion, and was not fond of the Galactic Empire due to their taxes on starship parts. However, Nomas had not been affected too badly to sympathize with the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nIllustrator Mike Jackson based the image of Nomas on uncredited model Tony Heath.",
