 "content": "Krata was a male Arcona tracker and information broker living during the Galactic War. He was hired by the Twi'lek Vette to learn the whereabouts of her sister Tivva, though Vette mistakenly thought him a Kubaz until their meeting. Krata eventually learned that Tivva was sold to Toobu the Hutt and passed over that information to Vette in exchange for his fee.",
