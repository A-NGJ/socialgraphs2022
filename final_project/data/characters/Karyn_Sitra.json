 "content": "Karyn Sitra was a human female pilot in the Bespin Wing Guard, the security forces for Cloud City on the planet Bespin. She had a son named Elvar. When former Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian returned to Cloud City along with Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, Karyn Sitra was one of the pilots who were sent to apprehend the starship which he arrived in. Calrissian spoke with Sitra, telling her to fire on them as the Galactic Empire had ordered, but to purposely miss so that he could get close enough to disable the city's automatic defense system.",
