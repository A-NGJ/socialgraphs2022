 "content": "Tray was a member of the Freelies.\nLike all Freelies, she sabotaged the factories of Vorzyd IV, to make the people realize that the job was not the main thing in a perfect society that the Vorzydiaks tried to built. Flip and her opposed the leader Grath, disagreeing with many of his ways. However, Flip actually wanted to keep the attention of his leader, in order to make Grath rely on him. He destroyed a building, killing many beings, including himself. Tray and Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to rescue him but it was too late.",
