 "content": "Cobus was a male Human Major of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War. In 3639 BBY his forces on Asation were attacked by the creatures coming through the Grand Hypergate that was opened by Kephess, servant of the Dread Masters. Gree Gatemaster Beltek'k tried to explain Cobus the situation, but Major had a better success with representatives sent by Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh. Cobus informed the arrivals about Kephess's involvement and provided the shuttle to fly the strike team to Asation. Cobus later thanked those involved after the situation was brought under control.\nMajor Cobus appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic during the introductory cutscene for the \"Terror From Beyond\" operation on Republic side.",
