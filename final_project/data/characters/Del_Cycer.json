 "content": "Del Cycer was a Human male who played sabacc with smuggler Lando Calrissian during Calrissian's second visit to the Oseon system. Middle-aged by the time of the Imperial Period, Cycer—who came off to Calrissian as a friendly, likable sort—claimed to be a retired businessman, although Calrissian regarded him as a formidable sabacc opponent and suspected that he was a professional gambler.",
