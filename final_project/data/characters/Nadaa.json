 "content": "Nadaa was a Human female who was a refugee living with her daughter, Adana, in the Refugee Sector on Nar Shaddaa, a moon of the planet Nal Hutta, during the final days of the Dark Wars in 3951 BBY. During this time, her daughter was kidnapped by the Exchange crime organization overseer of the area, the Quarren Saquesh, because Nadaa owed the Exchange 600 credits. While visiting the moon, the former Jedi Knight Meetra Surik spoke with Nadaa and agreed to help free her daughter. Surik met with Saquesh and attempted to intimidate the Quarren into releasing Adana. Surik was unsuccessful and was forced to slay Saquesh to free Adana from her cell. Nadaa was extremely grateful and thanked Surik.\nNear the end of the Dark Wars in 3951 BBY, the Human female Nadaa was a refugee who lived with her daughter, Adana, in the Refugee Sector on the moon of Nal Hutta, Nar Shaddaa. At some point during this time, Adana was kidnapped by the local Exchange crime boss, a Quarren named Saquesh, due to Nadaa's unpaid tribute of 600 credits to the Exchange. Saqueesh planned to sell Adana to the Hutts to pay the debt.\nWhile visiting the moon in search of Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell, Meetra Surik, a former Jedi Knight, spoke with Nadaa. She told Surik that her daughter was being held by the Exchange, and she begged Surik to help her. Surik agreed to help Nadaa rescue Adana, and she went to meet with Saquesh. Surik attempted to intimidate Saquesh to release Adana, but Saquesh was not swayed and immediately attacked Surik. The former Jedi Knight slew the Quarren and his guards and released Adana from her cell. Surik returned to Nadaa, who thanked Surik profusely for her help.\nNadaa loved her daughter Adana immensely and was desperate to speak to one of Saqueesh's underlings in hopes of convincing them to release her. Nadaa was exceedingly grateful when Surik was able to return Adana to her.\nNadaa appears in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. She is voiced by Kath Soucie. The reward for freeing Nadaa's daughter, Adana, is a random armor or weapon upgrade item. The Exile can convince Nadaa to sell herself to Saquesh, which results in dark side points. It is also possible for Adana to be sold into slavery if the player tells Saquesh to do it quickly, which also results in dark side points. If this path is followed, the refugee leader Hussef will later note that Nadaa went mad and vanished.",
