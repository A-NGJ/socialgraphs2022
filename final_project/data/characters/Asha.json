 "content": "Asha was a female Ewok warrior, daughter of Chirpa  and Ra-Lee, and older sister to Princess Kneesaa. Her defining visual feature was bright red fur, a very rare trait in her species.\nWhen Asha was still a child, a hanadak attacked the Chirpa family. Asha's mother, Ra-Lee, died while trying to save her daughter. Asha disappeared during the confrontation, leaving behind only traces of fur and clothing. After an unsuccessful extended search of the area, her family gave her up for dead. Asha was named after a spirit or character in the Ewoks' mythology.\nAsha was found by a clan of korrinas, who accepted her and raised her as one of their own. Asha spent her early adulthood tracking down Dulok fur traders under the name the Red Ghost. Many years later, Wicket and his friends saw her and told Kneesaa, who began to cry. Wicket went to see Kneesaa, who was holding Asha's ripped hood. Wicket and Kneesaa went looking for Asha. They eventually found her, and together they stopped the dulok fur traders. Then Kneesaa took Asha back to Bright Tree Village.\nAsha was created by Paul Dini for Ewoks, where she was voiced by Paulina Gillis.",
