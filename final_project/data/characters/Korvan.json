 "content": "Korvan was a male Human General of the Republic Army stationed on the planet of Quesh during the Cold War.\nKorvan was a veteran of battles on Dantooine and Velmor, and had years of experience defending resource rich planets. He was also an accomplished diplomat, able to balance the needs of the military with those of greedy corporations and their workers. He was the Republic's first choice to handle the crisis on Quesh.\nKorvan's approach to the Sith Empire's invasion of Quesh was centered around the defense of the planet's venom mines and workers. This created tension amongst some of his men, specifically his strategist Major Treeg who believed that a direct assault would quickly end the invasion and was therefore a better option.",
