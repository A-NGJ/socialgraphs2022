 "content": "Nari was a Force-sensitive near-human male who served the Jedi Order as a Jedi. In 9 BBY, after the destruction of the Jedi Order, Nari was hiding on the planet Tatooine and helped the owner of a saloon. Rumors about him being a Jedi spread through the galaxy, and three Inquisitors went to Tatooine to capture him, but he managed to escape. Sometime later, he asked for help from former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was also hiding on Tatooine, but the former Master told him to keep a low profile and live a normal life. Nari was later killed and his body was hung in a city on Tatooine.\nNari was a near-human male Jedi who served the Jedi Order. In 9 BBY, ten years after the destruction of the Jedi Order, Nari was hiding on the planet Tatooine. While on the planet, he helped an individual who owned a saloon in the city Mos Eisley, but stories about him being a Jedi started spreading across the galaxy. In exchange for his help, the cantina owner allowed the Jedi to stay in his saloon. Eventually, the Grand Inquisitor, a Pau'an male, heard the rumors and traveled to Tatooine along with fellow Inquisitors Fifth Brother and Third Sister in order to capture him.\nThe three Inquisitors went into the saloon, and the Grand Inquisitor questioned the owner about the Jedi. While the Pau'an was talking, the Third Sister threw a knife toward the owner's head, but Nari, who was sitting at a table, used the Force to stop it, saving the man's life. The Third Sister ignited her lightsaber, and the Grand Inquisitor ordered to prepare him for interrogation. Nari responded that they were wasting their time since they would have never been able to find all the remaining Jedi. The Third Sister tried to strike him with the lightsaber, but the Pau'an stopped her with the Force, pushing her away. The Jedi took advantage of the moment to escape.\nSometime later, Nari saw former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in a town on Tatooine, and he went looking for him in the desert. When the Jedi found him, Nari told Kenobi that he did not think he had survived, but Kenobi replied that Nari was making a mistake. The Jedi showed Kenobi his lightsaber, saying that there was no mistake. The former Jedi Master continued denying being Kenobi, but Nari begged him for help and told him that he was hunt by the Inquisitors. Kenobi told him to bury his lightsaber in the desert and go back to town to live a normal life. Nari tried to convince Kenobi to help him, mentioning the people that needed them, but Kenobi said they had lost and rode away on his eopie.\nNari was eventually captured and killed, and his dead body was hung in the city of Anchorhead. When Kenobi went to the town, several people were looking at his corpse in distress. The Jedi Master looked at him in sadness before going away.\nNari followed the Jedi Code even after the fall of the Jedi Order, and he risked his life to save an innocent, helping the cantina owner. Nari was convinced that the Inquisitors would have never been able to capture all the Jedi and tried to convince Kenobi to help him fight. After receiving a negative answer, Nari was disappointed and claimed that Kenobi was once a great Jedi, wondering what had happened to him. Nari had black hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.\nAs a Jedi, Nari was Force-sensitive. He used the Force to stop the knife thrown by the Third Sister. During the clash with the Inquisitors, Nari utilized the Force to drop the curtains of the cantina, facilitating his escape.\nWhile on Tatooine, Nari wore beige and blue robes along with beige trousers. He also had white boots along with a beige scarf. As a Jedi, Nari carried a lightsaber with him.\nNari was first pictured in the teaser trailer for the Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+ series, which was released on March 9, 2022. He first appeared in the first episode of the series, which aired on May 26, 2022.",
