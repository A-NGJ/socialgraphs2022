 "content": "Simo Oron was a male Bothan spy of the Rebel Alliance who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Simo Oron resided on the planet Naboo where he worked under the orders of the spymaster Bertos Goodner.\nIn 1 ABY, Simo Oron was captured by the Galactic Empire and detained in a small Imperial Base in the Lasay Swamp of Naboo. When news of his capture arrived to the Rebel base on Corellia, the Rebellion made arrangements to rescue Simo before he was transferred off world. However, his personal effects, including a sensitive contact list, were left behind. The Rebel droid C-3PO therefore tasked a group of Rebel operatives with obtaining his contact list in the Imperial base on Naboo before it ended up being discovered by the Empire. While the Rebel spacers succeeded in finding the contact list and handing it over to Bertos Goodner, Simo Oron was safely rescued.\nSimo Oron was mentioned in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mention of Simo Oron was added to the game with the revamped \"Rebel Theme Park\", released with the \"Chapter 6\" update, on May 22, 2007.",
