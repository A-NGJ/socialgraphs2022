 "content": "Ozuun was a male Argullian who lived on Argul during the Clone Wars.\nOzuun was an outspoken critic of the Galactic Senate and this made him unpopular among his fellow Argullians after Argul was attacked during the Clone Wars. A crowd of Argullians accused him of being a Separatist spy and surrounded him. However the Jedi Padawans Mariineh, Teo Gronn and Shalimin noticed what was going on and tried to calm the crowd and prove Ozuun's innocence.",
