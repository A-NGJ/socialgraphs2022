 "content": "Blark was male Wookiee soldier and weapon dealer who worked for the Organization in 32 BBY.\nAt some point of Blark's career, one of his cargoes was stolen near Sullust. Blark managed to see the thief, and held a grudge against him. In 32 BBY, Blark mistakenly believed to have seen the thief in Rothe Gate, a weapon storage asteroid. Blark growled in Shyriwook and attacked the suspect with his baton and a crew of four people. Nobody in the asteroid did anything except betting, and mostly against Blark. The other party was not his fugitive, but a considerably resourceful mercenary who had worked previously for Nirama.",
