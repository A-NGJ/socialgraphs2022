 "content": "Darth Arho was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and a Dark Councilor of the reconstituted Sith Empire. His strong frame, added to his bald head, gave him an intimidating appearance.\nAs a Sith Lord, he was extremely ruthless and when he journeyed to Ilum during the Cold War, he went with the single goal of obliterating his enemies: the Jedi, and the Republic. His tenure on the Dark Council was brief but memorable, ascending to the Dark Council after the death and betrayal of Darth Baras. The blows struck against the Sith Emperor by the Jedi Order only drove Darth Arho to push even harder for the final defeat of the Republic.\nDarth Arho stayed away from the powerplays of other Dark Councilors and his warlike personality was often used by Councilors against one another. He proved himself on Ilum to be a capable commander, however, the Dark Council disapproved of his willingness to win at all costs. But this attitude changed after the Empire's catastrophic loss during the Battle of Corellia when Darth Arho was selected by the Dark Council to lead the Operation Dark Ice, which would come to be known as the Battle of Ilum.\nThe initial landing was marked with heavy Imperial casualties as Grand Moff Ilyan Regus' forces struggled adapting to Ilum's harsh environments. Regus petitioned the Dark Council for help. Under his and Arho's command, the Empire began to make considerable advances; Admiral Shai and Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan were killed and the Jedi Temple was captured.\nBy this point, Supreme Commander Rans had called on the Republic's own heroes to respond to Ilum's plight. Seeking to quickly end the conflict, Darth Arho led an assault on the Republic's headquarters on the planet, capturing the command staff included the Supreme Commander. Victory seemed to be within the grasp of the Empire, but unbeknownst to the Sith, Darth Malgus had been feeding the Republic information on their movements to kill his primary rival, Darth Arho. The Republic heroes managed to free Rans, but not before capturing Arho's apprentice Lord Loyat. With the help of Malgus' information, the Republic heroes managed to finally put an end to Darth Arho.\nDarth Arho was talented in lightsaber combat as well as a powerful dark side user. Arho was able to use Force choke to hold his opponents, as well as Force drain to kill either enemies or allies and use their energy to heal himself and make him stronger.\nDarth Arho made his only appearance in Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
