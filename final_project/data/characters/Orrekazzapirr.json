 "content": "Orrekazzapirr was a male Wookiee that lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was an expert on surviving the wilderness of Kashyyyk and worked as an informant for queen Kylantha of Naboo.\nSometime after 0 BBY, Kylantha asked Orrekazzapirr and his friends Drrlirm and Imarrra to travel to their home world Kashyyyk and investigate the news that the Imperial force stationed on the planet was assisting the Trandoshan slavers. On Kashyyyk, Orrekazzapirr and his friends tried to investigate the Trandoshans' slaving operations in one of their camps near Kachirho, but were ambushed and overpowered. Orrekazzapirr and Imarra were captured and brought to the slaver camp. Soon after, the Trandoshans sold them to the Empire who shipped them to their prison facility on Dathomir. The Empire didn't want anyone to know about their involvement in the Trandoshans' slaving operations on Kashyyyk.\nOrrekazzapirr and Imarra were lucky, as queen Kylantha grew worried when she didn't receive any news from them and asked an experienced adventurer to investigate. The adventurer found the wounded Drrlirm in the jungles and eventually found out about their imprisonment on Dathomir. After the pilot had managed to sneak through the Imperial blockade around the planet and landed on the planet, the spacer managed to infiltrate the prison facility and help Orrekazzapirr and Imarra escape. Imarra knew the location of an old Alliance hideout on the planet where an old ship was stored. The two Wookiees managed to make their way to the hangar and used the old ARC-170 starfighter to leave the planet. With Imarra at the controls and Orrekazzapirr on the gunner's seat, the two met up with the spacer's starship. Together they managed to punch a hole in the Imperial blockade and escape to Naboo.\nOrrekazzapirr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. He first appeared in the game's second expansion pack, released in 2005, called Rage of the Wookiees. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.\nDuring the quest To the Queen's Aid, the player was sent to Kashyyyk to search for the missing Wookiees. Eventually, the player would discover that Orrekazzapirr and Imarrra were imprisoned on Dathomir. The player would then have to escort them out of the prison, in order to successfully complete the quest. The next part of the mission took place in space above Dathomir, and involved destroying several Imperial starfighters before the quest could be completed.",
