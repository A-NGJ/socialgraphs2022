 "content": "Harun was a female Devaronian youngling who was an initiate in the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython. Born after the end of the Despot War, a conflict that was fought between the Je'daii and the Despot Army of the Despot Queen Hadiya, in 25,805 BBY, Harun had red skin, yellow eyes, and black hair. The Force-sensitive girl was trained on Tython by the Je'daii Order, and in 25,793 BBY she and another initiate named Resi listened to Temple Master Ketu teach them about the history of the Order. Harun scolded Resi for saying that he hated Queen Hadiya, as she believed that hate was wrong, but Ketu reminded her that having only hate or anger was wrong.\nHarun first appeared in Force Storm 1, the first issue in the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi comic book series.",
