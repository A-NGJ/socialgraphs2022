 "content": "Ross was a Human female Lieutenant of the Republic military who served the Galactic Republic during the Alderaan Civil War stationed in the Pass. Ross and her forces were under attack from Killik raiders and House Ulgo soldiers, and were in need of immediate assistance. Colonel Jace Malcom commanded the Republic combatant to go to King's Pass and relieve the fighters there while he worked with House Organa's leaders to refine their strategies. The combatant was ultimately successful, and their efforts overwhelmed House Organa's enemies and forced them to retreat from King's Pass.\nRoss is voiced by Courtenay Taylor. Male Republic characters are able to flirt with Ross.",
