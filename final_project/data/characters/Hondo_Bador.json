 "content": "Hondo Bador was an male Sullustan who worked as a starship engineer on Ord Mantell during the Galactic Civil War outfitting smuggler ships. Bador was recommended to Han Solo by Mama as a potential source of information regarding the kidnapping of Leia Organa by the bounty hunter Alfreda Goot. Although Bador had recently outfitted a \"free-freighter\", his client was a male human hoping to work away from Imperial attention in the Outer Rim, and Bador had no knowledge of Goot.\nBador was destroyed by the Columi brothers, Craitheus and Marvid Qreph as revenge for the shooting of their mother. They did not know if Bador had done the deed, and had several suspects, so chose to destroy them all to be sure. Bador's private property was seized, and his friends and family killed.",
