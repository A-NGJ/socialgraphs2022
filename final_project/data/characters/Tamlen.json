 "content": "Tamlen was a male Human Sith Acolyte and a member of the Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Tamlen was educated in the dark side of the Force by the Sith Empire, receiving training from the masters of the Sith Academy on Korriban in the year 3956 BBY. While at the academy, Tamlen was assigned to work in the academy's library where he would update the records with new discoveries, such as the lore of Ajunta Pall. While studying Pall, Tamlen came across a legend regarding the Sith Lord's blade. Interested, Tamlen told another student about his discoveries without knowing he was actually speaking with the amnesic Dark Lord of the Sith Revan. Revan had been captured by the Jedi Order and reprogrammed to serve as their weapon against the Empire.\nFollowing Tamlen's encounter with Revan, the former Dark Lord sought out the legendary blade in the tomb of Lord Pall and recovered it. Shortly thereafter, Revan returned to the academy and assassinated the Academy's Headmaster Uthar Wynn with the assistance of the redeemed Sith Yuthura Ban. Together Revan and Ban purged the academy of all Sith students who would not convert to the Jedi teachings. Tamlen, refusing to abandon the Empire, was slain along with the rest of the academy's occupants.\nTamlen was voiced by Ethan Phillips in the video game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.",
