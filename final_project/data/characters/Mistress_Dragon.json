 "content": "Mistress Dragon was the name of the sand dragon which served as the guardian of Hethrir's base on his private Worldcraft.\nIn 14 ABY, a then five-year old Jacen Solo used his growing Force abilities to communicate with Mistress Dragon and persuade her to carrying him and his sister along with all the other captive children to flee from pursuing Proctors.\nThe children had to leave her behind, because the road that they would have to take to escape the base was too small for her. As the children crawled further, Jacen hoped that she would be all right, because the last thing they heard of her was a roar, which meant that she attacked the proctors chasing them.",
