 "content": "Vaas Ga was a Duros male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive, Vaas Ga was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, achieving the rank of Jedi Master by the start of the Clone Wars. The war, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, saw Master Ga pushed into the role of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic. Placed in command of Sarlacc Battalion A and B of the 41st Elite Corps, he saw battle on many fronts.\nDuring the war, Master Ga and his troops were assigned to take the planet Dinlo, working closely with Senior clone commander Gree. Overwhelmed during the fighting, Ga and his men were rescued by General Etain Tur-Mukan and the clone troopers of Improcco Company during the skirmish. While looking a little worse for wear, Master Ga did not sustain severe injuries during the costly battle and returned to Coruscant for new orders.",
