 "content": "Ajalo Nills was a Force-sensitive male Arcona, who worked as mercenary during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nNills was a member of a mercenary group that was led by the Zabrak Dantin Vellos. When the Ithorian herdship Bazaar traveled to the Cularin system, the mercenary group was hired to travel there and kill Osten Dal'Nay, the leader of the Cularin Militia. Nills accompanied the group and they ambushed Dal'Nay on the planet Cularin. He fled into the Cularin jungle and the mercenaries pursued. They eventually surrounded him next to a stream and attacked him with melee weapons. However, the heroes of Cularin then arrived and they attacked and defeated Nills and the other mercenaries.",
