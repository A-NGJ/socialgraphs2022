 "content": "Shelta Sune was a female Devaronian, who lived during the time of the Galactic Empire.\nThe mother and aunts of the Devaronian Lavek Talstin arranged for him to marry Sune. However, he considered Sune to be overbearing and obnoxious, so he fled before the marriage could take place. Under Devaronian law, once Sune and Talstin were married, he would have to give her most of his income and Sune didn't want to lose her opportunity for an easy way of getting money, so she got her mother, aunts and sisters to send their husbands to find Talstin.",
