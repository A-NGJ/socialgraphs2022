 "content": "Rohu Silgo was a male Selkath who worked on the Galactic Republic space station Carrick Station while it was a part of the Republic fleet during the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire. Working in the Cartel Bazaar section of the station, Silgo was a merchant of the Bounty Supply Company. The Selkath spoke in his species' language, wore a blue shirt, white pants and carried a blaster pistol while working. He had blue eyes, no hair and grey skin.\nRohu Silgo first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 BioWare MMORPG. In the game he serves as a Republic Bounty supply, accepting Cartel certificates as currency as well as credits. He was later removed in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015.",
