 "content": "Cicara Tuk was an Aramandi smuggler and merchant. Tuk was hired by a local crime lord in the Brak sector to transport a large amount of Aramandi artwork and trinkets for further sale to wealthy collectors. Instead of delivering the shipment, Tuk took the money that he was paid to acquire the items and disappeared.\nThe crime lord subsequently hired a group of independent spacers to track him down. Tuk hid on the planet Genesia until the spacers found him, forcing him to flee to the Aramand system. Despite being a member of the Seelas, Tuk forged credentials showing he was a member of the Mila akia and was taken under the protection of the Taler. The spacers were able to prove Tuk's credentials were faked to the leadership of the Mila.\nCicara Tuk was introduced in an RPG adventure seed in Flashpoint! Brak Sector. The individual that Cicara Tuk owes money to is dependent on whichever crimelord the player characters have a better relationship with, either Qual'om Soach or Eelien Kirat.",
