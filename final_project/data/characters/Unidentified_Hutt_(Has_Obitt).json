 "content": "A Hutt was based out of the space controlled by the Sy Myrthian species. In 19 BBY, concurrent to the conclusion of the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic, the Dressellian smuggler Has Obitt worked for the Hutt. The job, which he viewed to be menial and monotonous, came directly before demand for the smuggling trade heavily decreased with the end of the war.\nThe Hutt was mentioned in the 2016 novel Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, which was written by James Luceno.",
