 "content": "Tarkos Sund was a Human male businessman and inventor who founded Sund Technologies, a technology company during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. A thrillseeker, Sund sought to acquire a prototype accelerator that was said to have been lost in the destruction of the planet Taris three centuries earlier, but his attempts to recover the device from the Tularan Marsh was stymied by native wildlife. Sund turned to other individuals in the area, who successfully retrieved the accelerator for him.",
