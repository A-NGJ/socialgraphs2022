 "content": "Wooyou Senn was a Human male who served as an admiral in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War, and commanded Task Force Vengeance.\nWooyou Senn was tasked with the destruction of a Rebel Alliance force in the Airam sector including their shipyard in the Nocto system, and his flagship was the Executor-class ship the Vengeance. During the ensuing Battle of Nocto, Admiral Senn and his task force engaged the Rebel forces in their stronghold. However, after the Vengeance's shields were disabled, he was taken by surprise and perished when the Rebels and their Airam allies were able to ram three Dreadnaughts, containing explosives, into the rear of the Vengeance while a CR90 corvette rammed directly towards the bridge.\nWooyou Senn was created for the Balance of Power expansion pack for the 1997 LucasArts video game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter. The character's full name was revealed in the instruction manual accompanying the game.",
