 "content": "Moshenu Phobi was an Umbaran male who worked in the printing houses of the Plooriod Cluster and drew censure from the Galactic Republic for hiding anti-Republic messages within the official communications he worked on. During the Clone Wars, Phobi defected to the Confederacy of Independent Systems after being let go from an official Galactic Senate position within the Republic. He created the propaganda poster \"Deliver Us From Jedi Evil\" for the Separatists, which made use of existing anti-Jedi sentiment on Confederacy worlds in order to increase support for his employers.\nMoshenu Phobi was first mentioned in Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.",
