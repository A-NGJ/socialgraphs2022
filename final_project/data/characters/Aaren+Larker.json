 "content": "Aaren Larker was a male Samarian who served as the Prime Minister of Samaria during the Clone Wars.\nFollowing the Empire's rise, a resistance began on Samaria in 18 BBY. Aaren sympathized with them, and he secretly gave permission to Astri Oddo to sabotage the computer systems that control the city.\nEmperor Palpatine asked Ferus Olin to solve the problem, but tactics like this and others implemented by Bog Divinian, took him out of office when a call for a vote of no-confidence was made against him.\nAaren Larker went to prison and was killed by a guard the first day there.",
