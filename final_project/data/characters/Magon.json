 "content": "Magon was the mother of Sleeth and was the reigning crime lord of Malcraan, a city on Molavar around the time of the Invasion of Naboo. She, along with her son, routinely terrorized local farmers. After Sleeth's band was defeated by Darca Nyl in a raid on Byrom's homestead, she responded by bringing out a much larger group of criminals to attack the elderly couple. However, she was thwarted when Darca and a large convoy led by Tooth arrived, forcing her to retreat.",
