 "content": "A Human male sergeant in the planetary defense force of the moon Gall served during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When, during the war, a battle took place on Gall, the sergeant was amongst those who commanded the forces that worked with the Republic and fought the Confederacy's Separatist Droid Army. However, his men were unable to penetrate the shields generated by the Separatists' lead craft, which protected the C-9979 landing craft they used.\nThe sergeant explained his problems to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who then used jet-wing vehicles to penetrate the shields and destroy the lead starship that carried the shield generator, which allowed the defense forces to destroy the rest of the Separatist forces. The sergeant had pale skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair. At the time of the battle, he made use of a pair of binoculars and wore a thick moustache and green armor.\nThe sergeant first appeared, although was not named, in Inside Job, a comic written by Rik Hoskin and illustrated by Andres Ponce, which was published in issue 6.1 of the Star Wars Comic UK magazine series on November 12, 2009.",
