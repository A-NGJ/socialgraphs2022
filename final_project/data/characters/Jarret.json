 "content": "Jarret was a male human who, in his youth, worked as a contract killer for the Black Sun crime syndicate. Because of his brutality and lack of scruples, he was known as the Black Nail. At some point, however, Jarret decided to change his life and become a good man. In 4 BBY, he lived in a farm on the planet Ammon IV with his wife Loris and their son. That year, he got caught by his past when the bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo came to his door to terminate him. However, Jarret's spouse and offspring managed to convince Onyo that he really was a changed man. The bounty hunter let the former killer live, only taking his torn shirt with her so she could pretended he had died at her hands.",
