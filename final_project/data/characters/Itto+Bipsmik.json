 "content": "Itto Bipsmik was an Aleena Han Solo and Chewbacca met on Unagin a few years prior to the Battle of Yavin. She excused her two children for staring at Chewbacca because they'd never seen a Wookiee before. Han came to purchase for Jabba Desilijic Tiure a four-millennia-old portrait bust of the Hutt's ancestor, Great Bogga, recently unearthed on Near Pando, but Imperial Customs officer Rench, who followed the Millennium Falcon from Tatooine, ordered his stormtroopers to destroy it. Fortunately, Bipsmik had carved a near-perfect replica from anvilstone using a laser pantograph, which she planned to place in her garden, and Solo successfully passed it off to Jabba as the original.",
