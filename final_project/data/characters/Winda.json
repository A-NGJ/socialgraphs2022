 "content": "Winda was the youngest Ewok child of Ewoks Deej and his wife. Winda was the younger sister of three brothers: Weechee, Widdle Warrick, and Wicket Warrick. One winter on the Forest Moon of Endor, food was scarce for the Bright Tree tribe, and Wicket had to give half of his dinner portion of ground-apple stock to Winda. During that winter, when Wicket insisted to his older brother Weechee that he could show him a real hunter, Weechee jokingly asked if he was speaking of Winda.\nWinda first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in \"The Kroolok,\" a short story written by George Mann and Cavan Scott and published in the 2021 short story collection the Life Day Treasury. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Winda was introduced in the 1984 television film, Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure.\nHowever, her name was not supplied in the film, as it was given in \"Horville's Hut of Horrors,\" the sixteenth episode in the second season of the animated television series Ewoks, which was written by Paul Dini and premiered on November 15, 1986. She was then given the last name \"Warrick\" in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
