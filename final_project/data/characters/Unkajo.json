 "content": "Unkajo was a massive wampa with white fur and black eyes from the planet Hoth, located in the Hoth system of the Anoat sector. According to the Kouhun assassin Loathe, Unkajo was a beast that had grown old and powerful.\nBetween 4 ABY and 5 ABY, during the Iron Blockade, the Uprising was in need of a powerful weapon to use in their fight against Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Imperial remnant. The leader and founder of the Uprising, the Smuggler, was given advice from Her Majesty of the Noble Court to retrieve a weapon from Hoth as part of their efforts against Adelhard and Commander Bragh. The weapon was a stardrop torpedo that had been abandoned in an icy valley near Unkajo's lair. The Smuggler got through the icy surface and entered the lair after defeating several juvenile wampas. After a protracted fight, Unkajo was slain, allowing the Smuggler's allies to retrieve and use the weapon.\nUnkajo first appeared in the new Star Wars canon as a boss enemy in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising released by Kabamâ€”the wampa was required to be defeated in a story mission on Hoth. Similarly, the wampa had origination in Star Wars Legends as a video game boss in the 2003 Star Wars Galaxies video game by LucasArts. Both games would eventually be shutdown, with Star Wars Galaxies in 2011 and Star Wars: Uprising in 2016.",
