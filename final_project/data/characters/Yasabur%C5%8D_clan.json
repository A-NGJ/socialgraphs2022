 "content": "The Yasaburō clan was a notable family from the Outer Rim Territories planet Tao. A Jedi taught a member of this clan the ways of the Jedi, and donated a green-bladed lightsaber that was then passed down through several generations.\nHundreds of years later, patriarch Yasaburō adopted the Lepi former slave Lop, with the support of his daughter Ochō, after finding a fugitive Lop in a market on Tao.\nSeven years after Lop was taken into the clan, Yasaburō organized an attack on Tao's Imperial base, with the help of clan associates such as Kaku and Suke. The incident drove a wedge between Ochō, who was sympathetic to the Galactic Empire due to its contribution to the modernization of Tao, and Yasaburō, who saw the Imperials as oppressors who were destroying Tao's natural environment. The differences between them were so serious that Ochō renounced her family and joined the Empire.\nSome time later, Yasaburō, along with the few of his men who remained loyal to him, launched another attack on the base. This time, Yasaburō clashed with Ochō. In the melee, his daughter blinded him, and Lop arrived in time to save him. Using the family lightsaber, Lop dueled her sister, and wounded her, forcing Ochō to retreat.",
