 "content": "RB-919 was a human cyborg droid engineer who operated during the Imperial Era. As a cyborg, they empathized with droids that were created to perform simple tasks, and disliked instances where they had to destroy such droids. The bounty hunter Deva Lompop, working for Lady Qi'ra of the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate, hired RB-919 to repair the droid bounty hunter IG-88. RB-919 collected IG-88's remains, repairing him aboard their starship. While doing so, the cyborg contemplated the thought of programming IG-88 to partner with them, while also implanting a chip containing Lompop's mission directives into the droid's behavioral circuitry matrix. When RB-919 reactivated the droid, they introduced themself and their objective, as well as telling IG-88 that it was an honor to restore him. However, the first directive of the chip had been to kill those who were no longer necessary; as such, IG-88 shot and killed RB-919, commandeering their starship in order to complete his mission.",
