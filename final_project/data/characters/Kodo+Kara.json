 "content": "Kodo Kara was a male Twi'lek who was on board the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Blackguard during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKodo Kara appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, he would have been in some way involved with the Blackguard heroic encounter. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.\nThe directory files also contain largely incomplete strings of placeholder dialogue without any significant context. One of his strings of dialogue, \"Well that's just like, your opinion man,\" is largely reminiscent of a memorable quote made by a character known as \"The Dude\" in the 1998 cult comedy film The Big Lebowski.",
