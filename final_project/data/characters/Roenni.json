 "content": "Roenni was a young girl who was a member of the Young. When Qui-Gon Jinn left the underground to meet with the Melida and Daan leaders, he asked Roenni to care about the injured Tahl. When the Youngâ€“Elders War began, Roenni helped the Young to destroy the Elders' ship hangar, an event that convinced The Middle Generation to join the Young and eventually led to the Young victory. When Obi-Wan Kenobi was banished from the Young by Nield, Roenni was the only person who helped him.\nThe major attack that caused the Middle Generation to join the Young was just a small group made up of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Cerasi, Nield and Roenni. Although Roenni was small, her father had been a technician, and Roenni had grown up around all types of equipment. She was especially good with fusioncutters. When Roenni had disabled the starfighters, the four jumped back down the grate they had come up and escaped at the last second, before Obi-Wan threw in a grenade and the entire hangar exploded.\nRoenni was a quiet girl and a member of the Young, a group made up of the younger generation of people on Melida/Daan that wished to end the centuries-long conflict between the Melida and Daan.",
