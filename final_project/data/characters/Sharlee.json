 "content": "Sharlee was a Constancian female. She came from thirty generations of a proud warrior family that specialized in the use of battle armor. Her skill with battle armor was so advanced that she was able to use the Augment-9 setting, or nine times faster than a human, which amazed Han Solo. Along with Luke Skywalker, she defended the Constancian leader Gamine during her mission to Constancia.",
