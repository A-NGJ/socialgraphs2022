 "content": "A human male who had been part of the bureaucracy of the Galactic Empire served Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine as an advisor, making him one the most powerful individuals in the galaxy. The advisor accompanied Palpatine in traveling to the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in 4 ABY, and perished when it was destroyed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nA human male served as an advisor to Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine during the rule of the Galactic Empire. As one of the Emperor's advisers, he had come from the bureaucracy responsible for making Palpatine's orders reality, and was amongst the most powerful individuals in the galaxy. In 4 ABY, the advisor was one of six who accompanied Palpatine as dignitaries and attendants when he arrived on the unfinished DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station battle station to oversee the remainder of its construction.\nThe group flew on board a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle and arrived within one of the station's hangars while it was in orbit over the moon Endor. The six advisors remained with Palpatine to serve as required aboard the station while it was attacked by the Alliance to Restore the Republic in a trap set up by the Emperor; however, the Alliance ultimately destroyed the station, killing the advisor and the five other dignitaries.\nThe advisor had fair skin and brown eyebrows. Like all of Palpatine's advisors, he was totally subservient to the Emperor.\nThe advisor wore a black hat and robes with a red trim. Other than in the color, his hat was identical in design to that of fellow advisor Janus Greejatus, whose hat was from the planet Coruscant.\nThe advisor was created for the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, although he was referred to prior to the film in the Star Wars Legends novelization written by James Kahn.",
