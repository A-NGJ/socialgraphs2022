 "content": "Colandrus was a male Tarsunt who represented the Suntilla system in the Senate of the Galactic Republic in the period between the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars. One of the most influential delegates in the Senate, he was also one of the most corrupt. A gambling addict, Colandrus frequently had losses to cover, and he extracted money from every planet within his influence, trading favors for credits. However, he did so carefully, only drawing small amounts in each transaction, so that his corruption could not be proved easily.\nThree years after the Invasion of Naboo, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Sheev Palpatine, brought the promising Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker to Club Kasakar, where Colandrus used to gamble. While the Tarsunt senator was betting at a game table, the Chancellor and the Jedi, both in disguise, watched him from afar. Colandrus' last dice roll made him lose large sums of money. What the Tarsunt did not know was that Skywalker may have used his telekinetic Jedi power to rig the dice, inspired by Palpatine's unflattering description of the senator.\nHearing Palpatine—whom he did not recognize under the hood he was wearing—laugh at his misfortune, Colandrus sicced his bodyguard on him. The disguised Chancellor, however, defused the situation by pretending that \"his son\" had just told him a joke, and promised that they would leave at once. Still unconvinced, Colandrus nevertheless allowed the cloaked individuals to go freely.\nColandrus first appeared in the comic Obi-Wan and Anakin 3 during a flashback.",
