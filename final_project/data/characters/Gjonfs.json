 "content": "Gjonfs, also known as Sawbone Gjonfs was a Advosze warrior who served the Advozse Hegemony during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war, Gjonfs was considered a champion of the planet Riflor and was stationed along with two of the planet's other champions, Vorgan and 2R-CH, on Hammer Station, a salvaged Republic space station. The trio served under Warlord Kreshan on the station as he used it to conquer several worlds of the Outer Rim Territories, eventually entering the orbit of the planet Saleucami to demand its surrender. While the station was in the planet's orbit, an enemy strike team made their way on board and fought their way through the Hegemony's forces there. The team eventually encountered Gjonfs and the other champions in the station's security control section where they battled and killed them.",
