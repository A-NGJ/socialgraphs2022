 "content": "Evan Asani was a male Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the final years of the Republic Classic era.\nRaised within the Jedi Temple, Asani eventually graduated from the academy and was selected by a Jedi Master as a Padawan. Accompanying this master for years on assignments and missions from the Jedi High Council, Asani eventually took the Trials of Knighthood and passed to become a Jedi Knight. At some point in his training, Asani crafted for himself a lightsaber with a green crystal.\nIn 22 BBY Asani was stationed at the Coruscant Temple when Master of the Order Mace Windu assembled a task force to rescue the captive Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Galactic Senator Padm√© Amidala from their Geonosian captors. Arriving on the world with two hundred other Jedi, Asani fought for his life in the Petranaki arena as the Confederacy of Independent Systems unveiled their droid army.\nEvan Asani only appeared as a playable character in the multi-player mode of the video game Star Wars: The Clone Wars and not within the actual story itself. Save for his appearance, name, lightsaber color, and time of existence, nothing else is known about him.",
