 "content": "Ylanda Captison was a female Human who was the daughter of Senator Dol Captison and Marga Captison and the sister of Gaeriel Captison.\nLike the rest of her family, she was a follower of the Religion of the Cosmic Balance that dictated for every good, there had to be an equal bad , lest the universe fall out of alignment.\nAs such, when in 2 BBY Gaeriel was chosen to attend the Bakur Senatorial Academy and eventually join the Bakuran Senate, Dol and Marga gave Ylanda a golden alms bowlâ€”since her sister would become a senator, to preserve the Cosmic Balance, Ylanda was to become a beggar.\nYlanda carried out the dictate of her parents and religion.",
