 "content": "Dhowar Repareed was a human male who worked as an air traffic controller in his home village on the planet Savareen. His tongue was cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate when he and the other villages stood up to them; however, he was still able to maintain an effective silent communications network. In 10 BBY, he was present when the Cloud-Riders and a group of criminals formerly affiliated with Crimson Dawn joined together with the villagers to oppose the syndicate.\nDhowar Repareed was a human male who lived in a village constructed in the ruins of the Bis Refinery on the Pnakotic Coast of his homeworld Savareen. Like the other inhabitants of the village, he had had his tongue cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate after the villagers stood up to the criminals and refused to pay tribute. He worked as an air traffic controller, which is the easiest job of the village, so he has enough time for dreaming.\nWhen a broken starship comming to his village, he passed threw frightened minutes. In 10 BBY, he was present in the village when a group of Crimson Dawn affiliates led by the criminal Tobias Beckett landed in order to process coaxium they had stolen from the planet Kessel. He then witnessed the stand-off between the criminals and the Cloud-Riders gang and aided the two groups when they worked together to defeat the forces of the Crimson Dawn when they arrived on Savareen to collect the coaxium.\nDhowar Repareed first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first named in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
