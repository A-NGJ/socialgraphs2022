 "content": "A Human female with a heart-shaped hairdo was a member of Naboo's Royal Advisory Council around 32 BBY, under the rule of Queen Amidala. Like other members of the Council, she held a ministerial office, and her role was to advise the Queen on matters that fell within her purview. She was in the Theed Royal Palace during a meeting between Queen Amidala and the Council immediately prior to the Invasion of Naboo.\nThe unidentified councilwoman appeared as a background character in the 1999 movie Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. A brief, non-speaking role, she was played by an unknown extra. As of 2013, she remains one of the two members of the Council seen in The Phantom Menace that still have no name in canon. In their only scene, the orange-robed councilor and her bearded colleague were standing in the room, while their peers were seating around Queen Amidala.",
