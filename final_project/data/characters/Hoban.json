 "content": "Hoban was a human male living on the moon Raada during the first year of the Galactic Empire, and was the twin brother of Neera. After Imperial forces arrived on Raada, Hoban and Neera joined a resistance group organized by Ashla, a recent arrival on the moon. However, finding Ashla's methods too cautious for his liking, Hoban organized more violent plans for resistance behind her back, which included a planned raid on the Imperials' base. This led to his death during the raid, while Ashla, actually former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, was forced to expose herself as a Force-user to save the surviving members of Hoban's force, including Neera.",
