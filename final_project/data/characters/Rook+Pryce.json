 "content": "Rook Pryce was a Human male smuggler based on the planet Wielu. He gained a reputation as being untrustworthy, that no one would sell anything to him. Shon Ti'Ja, another crime boss, even attempted to kill him. In 21 BBY Pryce was on Wielu while Obi-Wan Kenobi was chasing the criminal T'mott Zoat. Pryce tripped him and Kenobi captured Zoat. Pryce then offered to take Kenobi to Helleguth, Kenobi accepted because he had vowed to bring Zoat in as a padawan, by himself. But Pryce released Zoat after T'mott bribed him. Later followed Kenobi to Wielu's jungle, where Zoat had gone. Pryce said he owed Kenobi, and he beacame his guide. They tracked Zoat to Boss Traygura's base, where Pryce betrayed Kenobi and gave him to Boss Traygura, in exhange for becoming her personal smuggler. Pryce was captured when Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano rescued Kenobi.",
