 "content": "Mekedrix was a human male who served in Roon's military defense forces and the Republic Military during the Clone Wars, holding the military rank of commander. He was stationed in the Roon system with Lieutenant Oron and a full company of Roonian soldiers during the early days of the war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Around the year 22 BBY Mekedrix's company was transferred to the 212th Attack Battalion, a battalion of clone troopers that served under Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Commander CC-2224.\nThe 212th was split into two separate groups during the Battle of Abrion Bridge. Serving as the commanding officer of Attack-2, Commander Mekedrix led the assault on the bridge's northern side while Attack-1 concentrated on the southern side under General Kenobi's leadership. Although the Jedi and his clone troops accomplished their objective, the Separatist Droid Army completely routed Mekedrix's forces. Consequently, Kenobi's forces were nearly overwhelmed by the Confederacy military.\nFollowing the massacre at the Temple of Eedit on Devaron, Mekedrix disappeared. According to Admiral Wullf Yularen, Mekedrix went rogue and joined the Death Wind execution squad. Kenobi and Yularen believed that war broke him in a irreparable way. Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to capture him on Ando in the planet's swamplands. Mekedrix was found at a Ancient Temple. There, he refused Kenobi and Skywalker's request to return to Coruscant to stand for his crimes. He claimed that he showed his victims the \"truth\" that the war was a distraction. When Mekedrix jumped to attack, Skywalker, without thinking, stabbed the rogue soldier through the chest to protect Kenobi. Although Skywalker was horrified and had wanted to bring Mekedrix in alive, the man was calm in his final moments.",
