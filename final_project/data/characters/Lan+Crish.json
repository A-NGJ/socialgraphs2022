 "content": "Lan Crish was a male Human who was a member of the Red Fury Brotherhood, a pirate organization that operated during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. In about 21 BBY, the Brotherhood were hired to steal a cargo of thermal detonators that a group of freelance agents from the Cularin system were transporting to the merchants House D'Vails on the planet Druckenwell. Crish's boss, Dacr Vrolm, provided Crish with details of when and where the agents were to arrive, and Crish and a group of pirates set out for docking bay 1138 in the city Taggon, where the agents were scheduled to land. When the agents eventually arrived and docked their starship in the bay, Crish approached them and posed as a representative of House D'Vails, in an attempt to trick them into handing the detonators over to him.",
