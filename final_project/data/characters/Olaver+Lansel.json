 "content": "Colonel Olaver Lansel was a Human male Imperial officer serving the military forces of Moff Kentor Sarne, the warlord of the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories. A sleeper agent, Lansel was inserted onto the planet Gandle Ott, posing as an alcoholic bureaucrat who had been punished for falling out with those loyal to Moff Sarne. Assigned as the Imperial liaison officer, he was known to be vocally critical of the warlord's regime. In 8 ABY, Lansel was activated by Sarne when the Moff was forced to retreat from his capital on Kal'Shebbol in the wake of a New Republic assault. Stopping at Gandle Ott, he gave Lansel orders to delay any New Republic pursuit, and to redirect them to the Shintel system where the Moff had an ambush waiting. Shortly after, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived at Gandle Ott. In a meeting with members of the starship's command crew, he directed them toward Shintel as Sarne had ordered.\nColonel Olaver Lansel was a Human male who was part of the forces of Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne of the Kathol sector. He served the Moff as a sleeper agent, and was inserted onto Gandle Ott as the planet's Imperial liaison officer. As part of his cover story, Lansel was known to have had a public falling out with officers personally loyal to Sarne, and had been assigned to Gandle Ott as punishment. Lansel was frequently seen to be drunk and was vocally critical of Sarne and his regime.\nIn 8 ABY, Moff Sarne was ousted from his capital on Kal'Shebbol by the New Republic. Falling back to Gandle Ott with his fleet, Sarne claimed to the population that he was embarking on a mission to purge the sector of Rebels and pirates. Sarne took on supplies from the planet, recalled all loyal Imperial personnel—including the governor—and left orbit with the majority of the defense force. Before departing, Sarne activated Lansel, giving him orders to run the command files that the Moff had installed in the planetary BRT supercomputer, CUTH-BRT-92-X3. The programming would force CUTH-BRT-92-X3 to obey the orders of its Imperial controllers, which in that case was to ensure that the FarStar, a New Republic CR90 corvette in pursuit of the Moff, was delayed and inconvenienced as much as possible. Lansel was also given orders to slow down any New Republic pursuit by redirecting them to the neighboring world of Shintel, where Sarne had arranged a trap for the corvette.\nSeveral days after Sarne's departure, the FarStar arrived in orbit and landed at Montrol Spaceport. Lansel was part of a delegation led by Marja Lang, the planet's Acting-Governor in the wake of her superior's departure, that greeted the crew. On the fourth day of the FarStar's visit, Lansel arranged for a brunch to be held at Torqumada Hanging Gardens to which the New Republic delegation was invited, along with various media personalities, business leaders, and politicians. During the event, Lansel relayed the information regarding Shintel to members of the FarStar's crew, implying that he had overheard other Imperial officers mentioning that Sarne was going to Shintel to \"pick up the backups.\" With a supposedly solid lead on Sarne's location, the FarStar left the planet in pursuit after establishing diplomatic ties between the New Republic and Gandle Ott.\nOlaver Lansel was a pale, thin-face man with mousy brown hair and a mustache. Serious and polite, he was possessed of a dry sense of humor. An undercover agent, Lansel was convincing at portraying a downtrodden and alcoholic bureaucrat. He was trained in the use of a blaster, and carried a sporting model in addition to a comlink about his person. He was knowledgeable about the workings of a bureaucracy, could operate security systems, program droids, and handle explosives.\nOlaver Lansel appeared in Death Is Remotely Possible, the third RPG adventure in The DarkStryder Campaign published in 1995 by West End Games.",
