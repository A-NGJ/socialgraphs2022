 "content": "Cavrolo Sys was a Togruta male hired by the explorers Fionn Tucat and Romina Foss for an expedition to the long-abandoned moon Lupal. The crews' minds were influenced by the solar flares of Lupal's dying star, particularly the Shistavanen Kordus Vrak, who confided the primal anger that the light had given him to Sys. Despite Vrak's demands that he be restrained if the solar flares continued, the crew continued their excavations unperturbed. Vrak was driven feral by the light of the star, and proceeded to attack the crew. Sys was the second of the crew to be killed, saddened with the realization that he should have trusted Vrak's instincts.",
