 "content": "Shawnkyr Nuruodo was a female Chiss officer in the Household Phalanx and a Clawcraft pilot.\nShawnkyr was born to the influential Nuruodo family, and by the age of twelve standard years, she was cadet commander at the military academy in the Rata Nebula. There, she first met the Human trainee Jagged Fel, two years her senior, and after repulsing a raid by the Cavrilhu Pirates, she ceded leadership of the cadets to him.\nAt some point in the next few years, Shawnkyr joined the Household Phalanx. By 26 ABY, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was Fel's executive officer in Force Spike, in which capacity she served under him at the Battle of Ithor. In 27 ABY, she was the only pilot to accompany him on his scouting mission to former New Republic space. On Hapes, in spite of their orders not to get involved in the conflict, she assisted him in recruiting the unit of volunteer pilots that became Vanguard Squadron.\nShe later took over the squadron when Fel joined Twin Suns Squadron. It is not known whether she remained with the Vanguards when a full squadron of Clawcraft arrived to serve alongside the New Republic, and after the major victory over the Yuuzhan Vong at Ebaq 9 in 28 ABY, she returned to Chiss space to report on developments in the war. She returned to the front line in the final stages of the war, however, and when the surviving Clawcraft of the Chiss squadron were amalgamated into Twin Suns Squadron, she flew as Twin Suns Four during the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar.\nThe uncertainty over Shawnkyr's age comes because of questions concerning the chronological placing of the short story Red Sky, Blue Flame, her earliest chronological appearance. Also, her name does not correspond to the expected pattern of Chiss names, probably because author Elaine Cunningham was not made aware of the precedent during the writing of the The New Jedi Order novels.",
