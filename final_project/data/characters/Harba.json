 "content": "Harba was a Human male miner who worked in the Damotit refinery, which processed the produce in the nearby mine, Damotite during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, Harba and several workers remained behind and continued work at the refinery when they were visited by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had smuggled a false identity and warned them that the shields of the refinery were on the verge to collapse. Harba and the workers complied to his advice and prepared to flee the building. However, the refinery was destroyed moments later, Harba and the other workers were able to escape the destruction.",
