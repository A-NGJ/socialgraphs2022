 "content": "Jilam Kester was a male Human member of the Antarian Rangers.\nShortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Kester took part in helping Jedi escape through refugee networks from Emperor Palpatine's hunters. Kester's assistance did not go unnoticed as he was given as a target for Squad 40, one of the Imperial commando squads belonging to the 501st Legion. Squad 40 tried to capture Kester on the planet Celen where he was hiding. Unbeknownst to the commandos, Jedi Master Iri Camas was with Kester at the time. Camas sacrificed himself and distracted the commandos, thereby allowing Kester to escape.",
