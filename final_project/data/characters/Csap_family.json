 "content": "The Csap family was a Chiss family of the Chiss Ascendancy. It received little respect in the Syndicure being \"mostly ignored or used as bargaining levers\" and used as the \"butt of a lot of jokes,\" despite being one of the Ruling Families.\nDuring the Nikardun campaigns, the Csap family was negotiating with the Ruling Mitth family to work together on a construction project in the Dioya system.\nThe Dioya system was the site of an attack which ultimately led the Chiss to discover the threat posed by the Nikardun Destiny. Mitth family Syndic Prime Mitth'urf'ianico, who was waging a campaign to sabotage the career of Senior Captain Thrawn, hoped to convince the Csap of Thrawn's \"reckless adventurism\" during his negotiations with the Csap.\nCsap'ro'strob was a member of the Csap family who served as Mid Captain of Irizi'in'daro's Grayshrike.",
