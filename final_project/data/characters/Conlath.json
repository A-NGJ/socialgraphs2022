 "content": "Conlath was a male Human General of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY he was commanding the Republic forces on Belsavis, when the Dread Masters attacked the Section X area, sending the Dread Host to attack both Republic and the Empire. Many Republic soldiers felt the influence of Dread Masters and Conlath was despite his protests rotated away from Belsavis and send to Carrick Station for medical evaluation. While examined by the medical droid M-2VB, Conlath asked a Republic hero to combat the Dread Guard forces in Section X.\nGeneral Conlath appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Priority Mission Courier for Section X, added in Update 1.5. Conlath and the quest were later removed from the game in Update 4.0, but brought back in Update 5.9.",
