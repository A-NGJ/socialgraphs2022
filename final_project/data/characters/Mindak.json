 "content": "Mindak was a human male who served as a lieutenant in the Stormtrooper Corps, a branch of the Galactic Empire's army, during the Galactic Civil War. At the time of the Iron Blockade, he held a command position among the Cold weather assault stormtroopers, better known as \"snowtroopers.\" After the Empire suffered a major defeat at Endor, during which the Emperor Palpatine and many of his top officers died, Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard put the entire Anoat sector on lockdown. At some point in the blockade, Lieutenant Mindak was assigned to a salvage team tasked with retrieving a Lambda-class shuttle on the icy planet of Hoth. However, he and his men were killed by the Smuggler, a young scoundrel who had been hired by the gangster \"Happy\" Dapp to retrieve the very same shuttle.\nMindak appeared in \"Clear the Way for B9-DT,\" a story mission available in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, written by Alexander Freed and Lori Hyrup. Despite being the end boss in one of the game's main missions, Mindak used the same skin/model as generic Snowtrooper Commanders.",
