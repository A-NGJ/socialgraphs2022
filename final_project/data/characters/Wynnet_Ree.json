 "content": "Wynnet Ree was a human female who was the daughter of the First Wavers Paron and Verine Ree. She died only a few hours after she was born. Her twin sister, Ciena Ree, wore a leather bracelet, a symbol of the bond between them. Ciena would recite the phrase \"Look through my eyes\" while showing the most important or beautiful moments of her life as a reminder that she shared her life with Wynnet.\nWynnet Ree was first mentioned in Lost Stars, a young adult novel written by Claudia Gray as part of Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",
