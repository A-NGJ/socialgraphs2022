 "content": "Vepp was a male Human who served on the Republic cruiser Esseles during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. When the ship was attacked, Vepp and his superior Salen were trapped in the engineering deck with the rest of the engineering crew. A group was attempting to repel the Mandalorian and Imperial invaders, and Vepp suggested that they reroute the power generators instead of depressurizing the engineering section.\nVepp was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears in the Republic Flashpoint Esseles.",
