 "content": "Pammel Tarqus was a male Human doctor who worked for the rebellious Sith Lord Grathan on Dromund Kaas around 3643 BBY, when he was killed by an Empire-affiliated individual. He owned a vine cat named \"Wraith\" and a sleen named \"Shadow\", and was working with them in kennels in the Malignant Bog.\nPammel Tarqus appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Dromund Kaas. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed by any Imperial character for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
