 "content": "Jimmon Arbmab, designation HC-4120, was a human male Imperial combat assault tank commander part of the Imperial Hammers Elite Armor Unit. First Sergeant Arbmab was commanding an TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tank through the streets of Jedha City when the tank was ambushed by Saw Gerrera's Partisans. In the ensuing battle, Arbmab was killed by a blast from Cassian Andor's A280-CFE.\nJimmon Arbmab was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as an Imperial combat assault tank commander with the designation HC-4120 in the Imperial Hammers Elite Armor Unit. Before or during the year 0 BBY, Arbmab was promoted to the position of First Sergeant and deployed along with his unit to the Mid Rim moon of Jedha.\nWhile stationed on the desert moon, he and his tank crew were assigned to the transport security of kyber crystals being exported from moon's main hub, Jedha City. Shortly before the Empire evacuated all troops from the moon, Arbmab and his crew were part of a kyber transport detail that consisted of his tank and a squad of stormtroopers. The tank and its escort were subsequently ambushed by partisans loyal to the rebel leader Saw Gerrera. Many members of the escort were killed, including Arbmab, when Cassian Andor, a spy on a mission from the Rebel Alliance, shot and killed the tank commander from his position on the tank.\nArbmab wore the standard white plastoid armor of an Imperial tank commander, including the gray markings that denoted his rank.\nJimmon Arbmab was portrayed uncredited by Louis Samms in the 2016 Anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and was first identified in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film. The character of Arbmab originated in the 1989 Star Wars Legends short story The Assault on Protazk, which was published in the role-playing reference book the Imperial Sourcebook, which was written by Greg Gorden for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.",
