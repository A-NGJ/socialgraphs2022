 "content": "An Imperial briefing officer, also known as a Flight Officer, was an officer responsible for assigning Imperial TIE pilots to their missions, providing tactical analysis of the pilot's role both pre- and post-flight, as well as explaining the various hazards and ship movements they should expect - or should have expected.\nIn this role he commented on the flight plans that were displayed to the pilots, and was eager to answer personally any questions concerning mission objectives, conditions, warnings and so forth. During missions, he would relay information to the pilots on changes of plan, enemy movements, and suggest targets to inspect, disable or destroy.\nThis officer first appeared in the video game Star Wars: TIE Fighter, where he presents the player with their mission objectives. In the TIE Fighter Collector's CD-ROM, he is voiced by Guy Siner, who had previously played Lieutenant Hubert Gruber in the British sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!.\nThe officer's rank badge displays four red squares over four blue squares, with a single code cylinder. This insignia appears identical to that of Major General Maximilian Veers in The Empire Strikes Back, but in canon representations of Imperial rank insignia, the only difference between the insignia of a General and the rank badge of a lower-ranking Major is the width of the badge, with the Major's insignia being packed on a narrower plaque. Some Admirals, perhaps specifically Rear Admirals, may also use the same insignia as Generals.",
