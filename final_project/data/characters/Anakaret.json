At a pirate clearinghouse, she was forced to participate in a deadly game at the behest of Aral tukor Viest. Her life was saved during the game by Leia Organa Solo. As a result, Anakaret felt she owed a debt to Organa, and hence helped her and her comrades escape the clearinghouse by broadcasting a fake Imperial transmission.",
