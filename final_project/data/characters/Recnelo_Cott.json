 "content": "Recnelo Cott was a female Ugnaught who worked in the Tibanna gas mines and lived apart from her clan in Cloud City on Bespin in the year 3 ABY. She had an apartment on Level 121 where Isabalia rent a room. She took part at the event led by Joy Iya to arrange a citywide work stoppage to get the attention of Calrissian and others running the city. At first they tried unsuccessfully to involve Isabalia, but later when a a stormtrooper appeared and aimed a blaster at the group, she didn't think; she exchanged fire and then beat the stormtrooper unconscious. She then offered to join Iya's work stoppage, and Iya's response gave her hope of having a lifetime together.\nRecnelo Cott first appeared in \"Beyond the Clouds\", a short story by Lilliam Rivera that was published in the 2020 anthology From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back. The character was initially revealed but not identified in a promotional tweet from Del Rey's account for Star Wars books.",
