 "content": "Liv'trai was a female Rutian Twi'lek Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Twi'lek, Liv'trai was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Master Liv'trai returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War.\nStationed at the training ground in the Tythonian Gnarls, Master Liv'trai was appointed as a Jedi Consular instructor to the Jedi Knights stationed there. One of the many Jedi that she was known to have trained was the young apprentice of Master Yuon Par, a Consular who would eventually become the Barsen'thor of the Order. Like many Jedi in the region, she fought against the native Flesh Raiders as they made aggressive attacks on the Order's territories.\nMaster Liv'trai was known for being rather patient and calm in her disposition, and as an instructor she was always happy to share her knowledge of the Force with less experienced Jedi.",
