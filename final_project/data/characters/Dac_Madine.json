 "content": "Dac Madine was a Supply Officer within the Galactic Empire.\nDuring the Empire Day festivites of 1 ABY, Dac Madine grew frustrated at the delay of many of his shipments. Various Imperial shuttles carrying rank insignia and code cylinder materials were involved in an embarrasing series of crashes across Rori and Talus.\nFortunately, an Imperial trader working for Kaythree located all of the six crashed shuttles, and delivered the completed crates of rank insignias and code cylinders to the delighted Dac Madine.\nDac Madine shared his surname with Rebel Alliance General\nCrix Madine.\nDac Madine made a cameo appearance as a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. During the Empire Day live events of 2009 and 2010, he could be found in Theed. Imperial traders doing quests for Kaythree would need to deliver crates of supplies to Dac Madine.",
