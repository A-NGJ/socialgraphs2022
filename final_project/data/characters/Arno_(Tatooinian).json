 "content": "Arno, also known as Old Arno, was a male Human settler on the planet Tatooine in 0 ABY. Arno was in good terms with Adar Tallon since Tallon settled on Tatooine.\nSoon after the Battle of Yavin, bounty hunter Jodo Kast traveled to Tatooine tracking Tallon because of an Imperial bounty. Kast threatened Arno, but Arno managed to escape from him. Kardue'sai'Malloc, a criminal associate of Kast, contacted with a team of Rebels who were also looking for Tallon to rescue him from the bounty hunters. Kardue'sai'Malloc told them that Arno, \"an old local who knows where Tallon lives,\" wanted to meet them at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. This was false: Kast wanted the Rebels to enter the cantina where he and Kardue'sai'Malloc were; Kardue'sai'Malloc would identify them and then Kast and his associates would ambush them. However, the Rebels survived the ambush. The Rebels would eventually meet with Arno, and Arno guided them to Tallon's home.",
