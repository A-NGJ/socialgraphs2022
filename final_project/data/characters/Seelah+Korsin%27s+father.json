 "content": "This Human male was the father of Seelah Korsin, a member of the Lost Tribe of Sith. As a descendant of the original Tapani refugees that had crash-landed on the planet Rhelg, he and his people excelled at science. This man, along with his entire family, was in the service of Sith Lord Ludo Kressh in the years leading up to the Great Hyperspace War. At some point prior to 5000 BBY, Seelah—who was tasked with the care of Ludo Kressh's feet—failed to stop an infection on one of Kressh's ankles stemming from a wound that he had received during a battle. As punishment, Kressh executed the whole family, barring Seelah, starting with this man.",
