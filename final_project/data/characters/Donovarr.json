 "content": "Donovarr was a male Human lieutenant of the Nova Blades pirate gang living during the Galactic War. In 3637 BBY the Nova Blade camp on Rishi that Donovarr was in charge of got hit by an air strike from the Wookiee Jakarro's XS stock light freighter, soon followed by a ground attack. Comparing the situation to a war zone, Donovarr called Commodore Dael Margok and tried to get his permission to move what remained of the camp to another island. However, Margok ordered him to stand his ground, and Donovarr was forced to face the champion who ransacked the camp. Donovarr, who killed over a dozen contenders to get his current post, lost the fight and got killed as a result.",
