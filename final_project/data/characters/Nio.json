 "content": "Nio was a Rodian residing on Redcap during the Galactic Civil War. He often drank daranu, becoming intoxicated, though this affected his ability to drive properly. He was driving with his friends when they gave Toob Ancher a lift to the Laughing Bantha cantina, though he had dropped and smashed a bottle of daranu in the process; it was swiftly replaced by another, but this was smashed over Nio's head by Saylor Marjan after the Rodian almost lost control of his vehicle.",
