 "content": "Gyuti was a Falleen male who was a Boss in the Black Sun criminal syndicate. At some point he was involved in a fiasco on Ryloth that could have costed him his life and took time for the syndicate to recover from. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he was invited by Lady Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn to attend an auction for Han Solo on Jekara.\nAfter the fall of the Empire, Underboss Rynscar, one of Gyuti's underlings captured the bounty hunter Jas Emari, informing Emari that she would bring her head back to Gyuti. However, Emari instead convinced her to give information about the location of Han Solo. She also promised to pay back three times what she owed Gyuti.\nSeveral months later, the bounty hunter Mercurial Swift decided to collect Gyuti's bounty on Jas. Swift had been humiliated by Jas and her companions on Taris and sought revenge. Underboss Rynscar confirmed that Gyuti still had a bounty on Jas. Swift recruited a crew consisting of the bounty hunters Dengar, Embo, and Jeeta. Despite capturing Jas on Jakku, Jas turned the tables on Swift by convincing Dengar and the others to join forces with her to hunt down Grand Admiral Rae Sloane in return for pardons and compensation from the New Republic.",
