 "content": "\"Forr\" was the nickname of a clone commando, who was a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Like all clone commandos, Forr was born and trained on the planet Kamino to serve as in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, which lasted from 22 to 19 BBY. However, Forr was killed during the war. He was mourned, along with all other clone commandos who had died at that point, by the Mandalorian training sergeants Kal Skirata and Walon Vau.\nLike all clones, Forr stood 1.83 meters tall.\nForr was mentioned in Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, the fourth novel in the Republic Commando series written by Karen Traviss and published in 2009.",
