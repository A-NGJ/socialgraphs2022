 "content": "Talie Heathe was a slender Human female scientist from Alderaan specializing in oceanics, who lived in the years before the outbreak of the Clone Wars.\nIn 26 BBY, Talie Heathe traveled with fellow scientists Fort Turan, Tic Verdun, Joveh D'a Alin, and Reug Yucon, on an expedition to the planet Haariden to carry out investigations on geological and volcanic activities there, to accomplish global mapping for the mineral titanite, and to determine the effects of the world's environment on its ecosystem.\nIn the midst of their research, however, the scientists found themselves caught up in a raging civil war and soon became stranded when their ship malfunctioned. Pinned down in the countryside, they were able to send a distress call to the Galactic Senate  while attempting to negotiate a truce between the opposing forces on the planet. Fearing that the scientists would be held as hostages or bargaining chips in the ongoing conflict, the Senate appealed to the Jedi for help.\nThe scientists were eventually found by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Soara Antana, and Darra Thel-Tanis, who were dispatched on a rescue mission to the crisis-bound planet by the Jedi High Council. From a deserted village holdout , the Jedi—leading them safely through perilous, war-pocked terrain—protected the scientists, until all were able eventually to flee the planet.",
