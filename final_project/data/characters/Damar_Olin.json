 "content": "Damar Olin was a human male smuggler who, for a time, was the partner of Izal Garsea. Olin eventually met Ana Tolla and her crew and joined them.\nDamar was born to a privileged family who was rich enough to afford a chauffer who taught him how to drive. Eventually he joined the smuggling business and met Izal Garsea. Both of them tried to survive on their own, but eventually had to join Ana Tolla crew.\nAfter a mission with the crew, Damar was on Actyllon in a polluted city. That day was Izzy's birthday and he had promised to have a fireworks celebration. He forgot. The crew visited a cantina, but after a firefight broke out, he chose to abandon Izzy in favor of them.\nEventually the crew made their way to Black Spire Outpost on Batuu. There they once again ran into Izzy, who was delivering a Pall Gopal's package for Pall Gopal. Ana Tolla told her to stay out of her way and stop following them. Izzy replied that she was doing her own job.\nDamar was eventually sent to Dok-Ondar shop to intimidate Julen Rakab and Izzy. He offered them a place in the crew, but they both denied.\nAna Tolla's job was to plant Sodilium detonators all across Kat Sakas farm because she refused to sell it to large companies. These would destroy the soil and make it infertile for hundreds of years. Damar teamed up with Delta and they kidnapped Jules and Izzy. Damar took Jules to the farm where he had him plant the bombs. They waited for Delta to arrive, but realized that she wasn't coming. Delta had actually formed a pact with Izzy and gotten a ship with Tap and Volt to retake the farm. Just as the ship arrived, Jules broke free and stunned a crew member.\nLater Damar held Jules at gunpoint with his weapon knocked away. A scream echoed in the night and Jules saw his chance. He reached for his blaster and stunned him.\nWhen Damar woke up, he was being taken away to Oga Garra.\nDamar Olin appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida CÃ³rdova as part of the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge multimedia project.",
