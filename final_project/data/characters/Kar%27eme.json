 "content": "Kar'eme was a Corellian Human male lieutenant in the Imperial Security Bureau during the Imperial era.\nKar'eme was originally from Corellia who served the Galactic Republic and was later part of the Imperial military from the moment of its conception. He served in the ISB as a tactical team leader and lead an ISB team in an attack on a loyalist safehouse on Coruscant. Afterwards, he also attacked an Alderaanian Resistance team that tried to return to the safehouse.\nKar'eme wasn't keen on spying on intelligence gathering, but viewed what he did with the ISB as necessary for the stability of the Empire. He could speak Basic, Bocce and High Galactic.",
