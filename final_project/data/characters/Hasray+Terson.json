 "content": "Hasray Terson was an attractive Human male with long black hair. His parents, Adray and Hasville Terson, were the owners of the Terson Comfort Carriers air taxi company on the galactic capital world Coruscant, as well as the starship, Ugly Truth. When the former senator and Yuuzhan Vong collaborator Viqi Shesh was helping the Yuuzhan Vong Denua Ku and Raglath Nur hunt Jedi on Coruscant during the Yuuzhan Vong's invasion of the galaxy in 27 ABY, Shesh spotted Terson hiding from the invaders. He was floating in a pool of liquid with dead bodies, but since he was alive, his body was not bloated like the rest. Denua Ku instructed Shesh to question Terson, but when the hunting party's voxyn got agitated, Ku snapped Terson's neck. Before his death, however, Terson gave Shesh a remote to access his family's ship.\nHasray Terson was created for The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand, which was written by Aaron Allston and released on May 28, 2002.",
