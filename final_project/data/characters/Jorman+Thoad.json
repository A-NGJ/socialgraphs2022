 "content": "Jorman Thoad was a Human male who ran a starship dealership on the Mid Rim planet Centares. By 0 ABY, Thoad claimed to be Centares' largest dealer in used spacecraft, and often referred customers to a cousin who dealt droids in Centares' Old Town. That year, Thoad made a rather lucrative trade when he met two Rebel leaders, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who were looking to offload a flashy yacht while evading the Empire. Thoad took the yacht in exchange for a less-expensive scout craft, which carried with it a much lower profile. A passing remark Thoad made during the exchange turned the Rebels' attention to an Imperial blockade of the Rebel-held Yavin system, sending them scurrying back to their base on Yavin 4.\nJorman Thoad made his first appearance in Star Wars  25, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979. Thoad was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
