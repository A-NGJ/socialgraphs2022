 "content": "Hareck was a male Ubese bounty hunter and a member of the crew led by the Ubese Boushh. Hareck was the lover of Ilini, a fellow Ubese bounty hunter and non-binary individual. After Hareck helped hide the body of Ilini's father, Ilini was exiled.\nHareck first appeared in the Star Wars: War of the Bounty Hunters comic book crossover issue War of the Bounty Hunters – Boushh 1, which was written by Alyssa Wong with art by David Baldeón. After the release of the issue, Wong confirmed and shared further details from their script notes on Twitter, including Hareck's male gender and observations about his personality. Wong later shared that Hareck was Ilini's husband.",
