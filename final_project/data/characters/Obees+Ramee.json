 "content": "Obees Ramee was a male Gran who lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. By 32 BBY he had come to live on Outland Transit Station were he began counterfeiting Republic credits and distributing them. This lead to the station's Toydarian owner, Rozatta placing a bounty on his head offering 1,000 credits for his capture alive and 500 dead. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett came across Ramee whilst the Gran was practicing shooting with a blaster rifle at a shooting range. Ramee and several others at the range attacked Fett, who Rozatta had informed of the bounty on the counterfeiter, but were defeated by the hunter who claimed the bounty on Ramee, capturing him alive for 1,000 credits.\nIn the video game, Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Obees is the fifth of five possible secondary bounties that a player can secure in the pit fighters arena section of the games first chapter. Players have the option of taking him alive or killing him, however this article assumes that he is captured alive as he is worth more alive than dead.",
