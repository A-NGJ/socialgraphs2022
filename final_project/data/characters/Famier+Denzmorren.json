 "content": "Famier Denzmorren was a male Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDenzmorren once ran a business enterprise called Bacta Bath and Beauty Works on Naboo. However, after a batch of cheap bacta that he had sold turned out to be parasitic, he was forced to flee Naboo to evade the local authorities and angry women's-rights groups.\nLater, on Genarius, he became the part owner and barman of the Raging Rancor Cantina, a Rancor-themed cantina. The cantina burned down in 32 BBY, and Denzmorren began looking for a new business venture.",
