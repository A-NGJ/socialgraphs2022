 "content": "Clay Tanoo was a male human colonist on the planet Cyphar who had training in plant genetics as well as in organic chemistry. His brother had taught him how to refine raw scarn into addictive spice. Along with Brigte Polcery and Lenora Scath, Tanoo formed a conspiracy that hired Nightswan to help them smuggle the spice off Cyphar inside shellfish. After learning of the smuggling operation Thrawn burned the entire spice vein and arrested Tanoo redhanded on Afe clan's territory, where Tanoo and several others had been digging for the spice.",
