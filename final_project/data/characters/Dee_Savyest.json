 "content": "Dee Savyest was a male Mrlssi scientist that worked at the Mrlsst Trade and Science Academy during the Galactic Civil War. During the war, Savyest helped design parts that were used in the construction of the Imperial battlestation known as the first Death Star. However, after the Death Star destroyed the planet Alderaan in 0 BBY, Savyest was overcome with denial, convincing himself that the Death Star could not possibly have been capable of destroying a planet. In 4 ABY, Savyest met a group of Rebel Alliance starfighter pilots that told the scientist that the first Death Star had indeed functioned properly, filling the Mrlssi with regret and sorrow.\nA male Mrlssi that lived during the Galactic Civil War, Dee Savyest was a scientist and researcher employed at the Mrlsst Trade and Science Academy, a renowned university located on his species' homeworld of Mrlsst. During this time, prior to the Battle of Yavin, Savyest and several other scientists helped design and build equipment that was used to construct the first Death Star, an Imperial battlestation and superweapon powerful enough to destroy an entire planet. However, in 0 BBY, the Empire used the Death Star to obliterate the peaceful planet Alderaan. When Savyest heard about Alderaan's demise at the hands of the Death Star, the Mrlssi scientist went into denial, refusing to believe the Death Star could have functioned properly and destroyed Alderaan. To these ends, Savyest made several calculations that he claimed \"proved\" that the Death Star was not capable of detonating a planet.",
