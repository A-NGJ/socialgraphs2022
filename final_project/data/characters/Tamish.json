 "content": "Tamish was a male Thennqora hunter who traveled to Varonat to hunt Morodin. He bagged a Morodin alongside the Saffa, Cob-caree.\nTamish, a male Thennqora, was a wealthy businessbeing. In 8 ABY, he traveled to the planet Varonat to hunt Morodin. Alongside a Saffa, Cob-caree, he killed a Morodin.\nTamish was a wealthy Thennqora who was bored and looking for excitement, leading to him signing up for a hunting expedition. Despite his wealth, he complained that he had to work for his excitement. Unlike his fellow hunters, Tamish had some experience in hunting, and was able to identify a Morodin slime trail.\nTamish first appeared in Timothy Zahn's First Contact, which was published in 1994's Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 by West End Games. First Contact was subsequently reprinted in The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4, Tales from the Empire, and on Hyperspace.",
