 "content": "Race Kartan was a notorious male Human smuggler who flew a personal starfighter called Duergo around the time of the Occupation of Karthakk.\nAt some point prior to the Battle of Nod Kartha, Race Kartan was hunted down by the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Fett tracked Kartan to a space station where his Slave I engaged the Duergo in a dogfight within the station's deflector shield. Kartan was unable to overcome his pursuer, and his vessel was disabled, presumably allowing Fett to collect the bounty.\nKartan was an acquaintance of the Toydarian mechanic Reti, who arrived to aid the smuggler during his battle with Fett. Reti soon fled, however, and it may have been this incident that led to Fett pursuing a bounty on Reti's head prior to the First Battle of Geonosis.\nThe capture of Race Kartan is depicted in \"Jango Fett\", a bonus mission in Jedi Starfighter.",
