 "content": "Bwahl was a one-eyed Hutt salesman/crimelord who operated on Torque.\nAfter the Tournament on Serenno, the Box came into the possession of Bwahl, and he made it mobile. Bwahl used the Box to travel to the strongholds of his rival kajidics, where he tortured his enemies for entertainment.\nSometime before the Battle of Yavin, he had some ancient artifacts he wanted to buy, so he gave the currency to Han Solo and Chewbacca. They traveled to Mimban to deliver and receive the credits and artifacts to the salesman, a male Human named Jake. He was known to use kessum during interrogations.\nAt one point, Boba Fett's daughter Ailyn Vel took contracts from Bwahl as a bounty hunter.\nBwahl was named after Brendon Wahlberg, a member of the Star Wars Fanboy Association.",
