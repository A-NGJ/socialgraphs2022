 "content": "Lonnag Giba was the head of Queen Veda's Council of Ministers on the planet Gala. He conspired with Deca Brun against the Queen during the Galacian Gubernatorial election, imprisoning her and attempting to take over the city of Galu. He also dispatched the royal guard against the hill people, claiming they were savages, to eliminate Elan, the true heir to King Cana. However, Prince Beju turned on Giba after realizing he was not the true heir but Giba challenged his authority, until Veda arrived to arrest him. In desperation, Giba drew forth Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber, which was confiscated by Brun's henchmen but was disarmed by Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn. As the royal guard attempted to arrest him, he attempted to confuse them, claiming that the royal house is in chaos and the arrival of hill people in the city precipitates civil war. However, Jono Dunn emerged to reveal Giba's dealings with Brun and Offworld Corporation. Giba was then arrested.",
