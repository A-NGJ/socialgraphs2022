 "content": "Tharston Kharl was a male Human who worked in Lando Calrissian's Sarnus Refinery on Sarnus. He had a wife back on Telos but he carried on an affair with Dena Yus, a biot created by Galactic Exploitation Technologies to spy on Calrissian's operations. Kharl died sometime in 45 ABY after the refinery was sabotaged by Vestara Khai, a former member of the Lost Tribe of Sith and an agent of Galactic Exploitation Technologies.\nKharl was remembered by Yus as cheerful, supportive and gentle, even though he was obnoxious when playing sabacc.",
