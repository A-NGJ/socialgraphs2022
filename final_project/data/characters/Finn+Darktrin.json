 "content": "Finn Darktrin was an undercover agent working for the Galactic Empire.\nDarktrin was a student of Loam Redge, and had been posing as a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic for several years prior to the Battle of Yavin, infiltrating high up on its command scale. He also had had several partnerships with Nym.\nAround 1.5 ABY, he teamed up with Imperial xenobiologist Dusque Mistflier to deliver a data holocron with valuable information to the Rebel Alliance. Dusque developed a strong affection for him, unaware of his deception, or of the fact that he returned her feelings for him.\nDarktrin retrieved the holocron and managed to transmit part of it to the Empire before Dusque intervened. Finn stabbed her and escaped to his Imperial masters. Darth Vader forgave him for his failure. Dusque survived the incident, joining the Alliance after being rescued by Luke Skywalker.",
