 "content": "Quilsen was a Spiner who had become down-and-out and used the phetaril spice by the time of the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon in 4 ABY. Following that event, the Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles met Quilsen while she was touring a string of seedy bars along the Outer Rim Territories. Quilsen introduced Snootles to phetaril, and from that point onward the Pa'lowick would drown her sorrows in the spice.\nQuilsen was mentioned in \"Who's Who in the Max Rebo Band,\" an article Rich Handley wrote for the sixty-seventh issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine that was released on April 15, 2003.",
