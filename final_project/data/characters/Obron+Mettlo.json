 "content": "Obron Mettlo was a male Moorin who worked as a mercenary and assassin during the Galactic Civil War. After hiring on with Jabba the Hutt, he was fed to the rancor as punishment for killing two of the Hutt's other hirelings.\nMettlo was, if his own statements were accurate, a veteran of dozens of battles, during most of which he fought on the winning side. He arrived on Tatooine around 1 BBY, and began to search for work within Mos Eisley.\nSoon afterward, while the Devaronian spy Kardue'sai'Malloc sat in the Mos Eisley Cantina, he overheard two Human criminals in the cantina trying to hire Mettlo to help rob another bar on the other side of town. Mettlo, whether because he was annoyed by the poor grasp of his native tongue displayed by his prospective employers, or because he considered a simple robbery beneath a professional like himself, declined the offer. Kardue'sai'Malloc later recommended Mettlo to Jabba Desilijic Tiure, noting that despite the Moorin's bad attitude, he was an intelligent, experienced professional.\nUnfortunately for Kardue'sai'Malloc, Mettlo's service to Jabba was short-lived. Soon after getting into a fight and killing two of Jabba's other henchmen, Mettlo was fed to Jabba's rancor. It was also rumored that Mettlo had been hired as an assassin by Jabba's rival, Lady Valarian, and that he had been ordered to infiltrate Jabba's court to kill the Hutt kingpin. Kardue'sai'Malloc had to give Jabba free information on Lady Valarian's upcoming wedding in order to make up for his error, and escape being eaten himself.",
