 "content": "Pit Cornburr was a male Human who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he worked for the Galactic Empire's support staff as a maintenance worker in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. There, scientists were secretly conducting dangerous scientific research for the Empire, intending to re-engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus into a bioweapon. In 1 ABY, he was present when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility and the virus escaped containment. Cornburr and most of the people in the area fell victim to the Blackwing virus, and turned into undead manifestations. Pit Cornburr's undead body was controlled by the virus and kept walking around in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility until it was destroyed by a spacer at the deepest level of the research facility.\nPit Cornburr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Pit Cornburr was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14,\" released on October 12, 2009.\nExamining Pit Cornburr simply identified him as Cornburr, but one of the computer readouts in the facility listed his full name as Pit Cornburr. He was one of the Undead boss enemies in the Quarantine Zone that players have to kill to complete a collection.",
