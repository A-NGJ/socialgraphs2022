 "content": "A male Human served as a false Prophet of the Dark Side. He was a member of the Church of the Dark Side, a mock religion established by the Imperial Intelligence following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. He wore a full beard and used spectacles. When the pseudo-Kadann welcomed Zorba the Hutt aboard Scardia Station, the members of the Church honored him with a banquet held in their most formal dining hall. Like most members Prophets, the bespectacled Prophet had a refined personality, and had a hard time tolerating the Hutt's poor table manners. When Zorba started to thrown food all over the place while he was eating, the Prophet was hit by a jet of skewers, which prompted him to protect his face.",
