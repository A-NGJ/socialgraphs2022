 "content": "CC-2237, nicknamed \"Odd Ball\" and also known as Davijaan, was a Clone Commander and pilot during the Clone Wars who participated in campaigns such as the Battle of Teth, the Battle of Umbara, the Battle of Coruscant, and the Battle of Utapau. A skilled pilot, Odd Ball flew an assortment of various starfighters including a V-19 Torrent starfighter, a BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber and an ARC-170. During the Clone Wars, Odd Ball often served under the command of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nCC-2237, also eventually known by the codename \"Odd Ball,\" which was also the clone trooper pilot's callsign, was a male human clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on Kamino. While on Kamino, Odd Ball received early training as part of the pilot program.\nWith the outbreak of the Clone Wars following the First Battle of Geonosis, Odd Ball, now a Clone Commander and leader of Clone Flight Squad Seven, was sent to a flight academy on the Republic capital planet of Coruscant for additional training. There, Odd Ball learned new tactics and tricks, which he passed down to the pilots under his command. As the squadron commander of Squad Seven, Odd Ball fell under the leadership of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and under the structure of his Open Circle Armada.\nDuring the Republic's attempt to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son, Odd Ball was called in to assist the troops who were fighting Separatist Alliance forces during the Battle of Teth. Flying in a V-19 Torrent starfighter, he and Squad Seven fought oncoming vulture droids alongside Kenobi. During the battle, Odd Ball was tailed by vulture droids and remarked that he was unable to shake them off. General Kenobi came to the pilot's aid and was able to destroy the droids and save Odd Ball. The clone pilot apologized for panicking and Kenobi assured him that it happened to everybody.\nAt the start of the Battle of Umbara, Odd Ball participated alongside the rest of Squad Seven, and he along with another bomber were called in to provide reinforcements. They bombed a vulnerable enemy position moments after the last of the clone forces evacuated the area.\nOdd Ball was present on Cato Neimoidia, escorting Jedi General Plo Koon in the atmosphere. His unit, Clone Flight Squad Seven, participated in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia.\nOdd Ball also participated in the Battle of Coruscant, leading Clone Flight Squad Seven to the Invisible Hand for Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. He ordered the squad's V-19 Torrent starfighters to take point, this group of fighters punched a hole through the Droid tri-fighters. This allowed the Jedi and the squad's ARC-170 Starfighters to move towards the Invisible Hand. When the Jedi landed in the ship's hangar, the squad eliminated priority targets and stayed close in case they were needed for aid. He did not expect the Jedi to survive.\nWhen it was discovered that the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous was hiding on the planet of Utapau, Kenobi and the 212th Attack Battalion were sent. Clone troopers engaged battle droids in a heated confrontation, whilst Kenobi had his final confrontation with Grievous, ultimately resulting in the cyborg's death. A time later, however, Order 66 was issued by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As the contingency was issued, Odd Ball was in battle above Utapau as part of Obi-Wan's fleet. Odd Ball and the rest of Squad Seven on Utapau turned on the Utapau Skyforce and subjugated the planet. Odd Ball and his unit later served the Galactic Empire.\nA human male clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, CC-2237 was 1.83 meters tall and had brown eyes. He proved to be a skilled pilot during the Clone Wars and was apologetic towards Obi-Wan Kenobi when the Jedi provided assistance at the Battle of Teth.\nInitially during the Clone Wars, Odd Ball donned standard Phase I armor for all clone trooper pilots. Later on in the war, he switched to the Phase II variant which featured a fully enclosed helmet and breathing apparatus. However even further on in the war his armor changed yet again when he adopted the newer open-helmet design, which he wore during the Battle of Coruscant.\nCC-2237 was portrayed by Temuera Morrison in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. He also appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series, in which he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.\nIn Star Wars Helmet Collection 45, predominantly in the first half of the magazine, Odd Ball is first referred to as a Clone Commander. In the second half of the magazine, the rank changes to Clone Captain. Because Star Wars: Complete Vehicles also refers to him as a Clone Commander, this article assumes that the rank of Clone Captain is erroneous.",
