 "content": "A male rancor was owned by Karagga the Hutt prior to the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Bred from a long line of competitive battle rancors, the rancor was the champion of the battle pit at Karagga's Palace on the planet Nal Hutta, and sired a child named Bonethrasher. However, Bonethrasher slew his father in combat at only seven months old and went on to be the undisputed champion of Karagga's pit until he himself was killed in 3640 BBY.\nBonethrasher's father was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Bonethrasher in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. The Codex entry was added to the game in 2012 as part of Game Update 1.1.",
