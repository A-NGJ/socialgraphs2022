 "content": "Tien Wallub was a male Sullustan bartender who lived on Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Wallub worked in a cantina in Kachirho. In 1 ABY, a Trandoshan by the name Jessk was catch cheating at sabacc with other customers, including with a friend of the cantina's owner. The owner then decided to take it upon himself to solve the problem and tasked Tien Wallub to place a bounty on Jessk. The bounty was addressed to Imperial Bounty Officer Stren Colo and the Trandoshan was forced to flee Kashyyyk. Jessk was eventually shot down by a bounty hunter on the planet Tatooine.\nTien Wallub appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tien Wallub was added to the game with the release of the expansion pack Rage of the Wookiees on May 5, 2005.",
