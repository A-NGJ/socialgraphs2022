 "content": "Lonkin was an Imperial trooper and a hero of Divac 7. In 13 ABY, he was one of the best warriors of the Restored Empire faction, a splinter group that was formed after the death of Emperor Palpatine at Endor. He was stationed on RZ7-6113-23, an asteroid, in which a facility was located. Lonkin was killed by Ennix Devian during a demonstration vibro-lance duel to impress Kir Kanos, an Emperor's Royal Guard. Kanos remarked that the death of a good soldier like him was a waste, and was annoyed.",
