 "content": "LX-466 was a Human male who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as a stormtrooper.\nIn 1 ABY, he was stationed in an Imperial Outpost on Dantooine. Here, he hired an Imperial soldier to patrol the area and destroy any Rebel resistance. The soldier successfully killed a stranded Rebel Commander and two scouts that accompanied him. LX-466, impressed with his soldier's work, tasked him with delivering some rations to a Dantari informant. The soldier did so dutifully, but LX-466 had one more task for him, which involved delivering a recording rod to an Imperial courier.\nThe soldier once again performed the job adequately, much to LX-466's delight.\nLX-466 is a Non-Player Character in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies which gives players a short series of quests.",
