 "content": "Ardustagg, also known as Ardustagg the Absolute, was a Hutt leader in Pre-Republic era that led mass uprisings and drove the Rakata off Varl after the Hutts realized that the Rakata were already on their downward spiral, thus easily revolting and freeing themselves of Rakatan oppression. Later Hutts under Ardustagg seized the Rakatan technology for themselves and started creating a star empire.",
