 "content": "Dovrin was a male Cathar captain who led a group of Black Sun pirates during the Second Imperial Civil War.\nIn 137 ABY, his pirates hijacked an Imperial shipping vessel in the 5709-DC Shipping Lane. His intentions were to acquire new Thunderbolt Mark 7 blasters that the ship was transporting. In arguing with a C-series protocol droid, he shot the droid with his blaster and threatened the life of Captain Piard. After hearing a noise in the background, Dovrin sent his crew—consisting of an Quarren, a Nautolan, and a Nikto—to investigate, only to find that they had been knocked out and replaced by Cade Skywalker, Jariah Syn, and Deliah Blue. Upon seeing them, Dovrin shot at Cade but it was deflected by Cade's green lightsaber, hitting him in the chest and killing him.",
