 "content": "Rillik was a male Katikoot. The nephew of minister of works Kittik and the cousin of Kittik's daughter Mittik, Rillik once worked as a miner in the mines on Gloam, the twin planet of Aubadas, the home of the Katikoot species. There, Rillik contracted the miner's curse, a disease which commonly afflicted workers there. When the Katikoot halted mining operations on Gloam due to the environmental damage that had been inflicted, Rillik sought to secretly sell out the planet's resources to gain wealth for himself with what time he had left.",
