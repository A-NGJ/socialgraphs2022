 "content": "A male Yresilini was trained as a general by the Chiss student Sev'rance Tann at some point by 22 BBY. Tann had been challenged by a professor at the Chiss Academy to train a group of Yresilini into an army, overcoming the species' perceived untrainable nature. Tann began by appointing one Yresilini as a general and giving him several rudimentary commands, which the general and his fellow creatures laughed at. Tann had the general executed in front of the other Yresilini, and then chose a successor who obeyed her instructions implicitly and led the other Yresilini to do likewise.\nThe Yresilini general was mentioned in Sev'rance Tann's databank entry in the 2002 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns.",
