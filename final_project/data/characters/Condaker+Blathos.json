 "content": "Condaker Blathos was a Rodian male who resided on the planet Genarius in the Cularin system during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, where he was a resident of the city Tolea Biqua. Blathos was a member of the Intarsa League, a criminal faction led by the Force Adept Dersa Welles and circa 31 BBY he accompanied the League on a shuttle journey to the planet Cularin to meet with the Rodian scoundrel Roos Londabir to setup a shell company. However, the shuttle was attacked by an unknown rival en-route and crash-landed on the Cularin surface. Blathos was killed in the impact and his corpse was subsequently discovered by the Heroes of Cularin.",
