 "content": "Trazzen was a Human male who served as captain and commanding officer of the Star Destroyer Obliterator of the Starfleet of the Imperial Remnant some fifteen years after the Battle of Endor. He was one of four Braxant Sector Fleet officers whose Star Destroyers were chosen to serve Flim, a con-artist portraying a returned Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the plans of Moff Disra and Royal Guardsman Grodin Tierce to envelope the New Republic into a civil war over the crisis concerning the revealed Caamas Document. In order to convince Trazzen and his fellow officers—captains Nalgol of the Tyrannic, Argona of the Ironhand, and Dorja of the Relentless—that Flim was Thrawn, Disra had a meeting executed where the four captains personally met with the Thrawn-apparent. Of the four Star Destroyers, the Tyrannic, Obliterator, and Ironhand were chosen to lead a assault on the Bothan homeworld of Bothawui, in which the assault was foiled and the Star Destroyers were forced to withdraw. After that event, Trazzen's fate is unknown.\nTrazzen was soft-spoken, but had a reputation for being vicious.",
