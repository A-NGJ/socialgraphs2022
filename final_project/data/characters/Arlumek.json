 "content": "Arlumek was a male Cragmoloid who was the third son of Boulad, an information broker and slicer.\nA year after the Galactic Empire was established, Boulad was visited by Naboo Security Officer Gregar Typho, who asked him about information about Sith Lord's locations and travels in the past. After brief negotiations, Boulad decided to hand over the information to the Captain for payment of 5,000 credits, as it was no problem for him to infiltrate the Empire's central computer and records and obtain records that would be unattainable to normal living beings. Based on this information, Typho realized that Darth Vader was responsible for the death of Padm√© Amidala and left the caragmoloid again.",
