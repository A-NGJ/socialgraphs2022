 "content": "Tschel was a human male who was military officer in the military forces of the Imperial Remnant. Tschel had characteristic of former Galactic Empire personnel who came of age after the Battle of Endor.\nBy 9 ABY, Tschel held the rank of Lieutenant, and was assigned as a bridge officer aboard the Star Destroyer Chimaera, then serving as the command ship of Grand Admiral Thrawn himself. In the eyes of the flagship's captain, Gilad Pellaeon, Tschel was absurdly young to hold such an important post, with a lack of experience and self-control for which his training and enthusiasm could not compensateâ€”but also all too typical of the young volunteers and conscripts who now made up the bulk of the Starfleet's front-line forces, and hardly to be blamed for his own lack of combat experience.\nThe subsequent campaign against the New Republic tempered and hardened Tschel and other young officers like him, but little is known of his service over the subsequent decade after the Battle of Bilbringi.\nTen years later, Tschel served as a bridge officer aboard the Chimaera with the rank of Major under Captain Ardiff.\nTschel first appeared in the 1991 novel Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn. According to Zahn, Tschel was designed to show the slipping quality of Imperial personnel since the Battle of Endor and to contrast with the competence shown by his superior, Captain Pellaeon.",
