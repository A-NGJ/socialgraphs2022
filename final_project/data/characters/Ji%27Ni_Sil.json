 "content": "Ji'Ni Sil was a Jawa who lived during the Galactic Civil War on Tatooine. After the Battle of Yavin, Sil worked as the trader at the Jawa Mountain Fortress. He owned a protocol droid named C4-ZX as a translater. In 1 ABY, Ji'Ni Sil was approached by a spacer who was looking for a body casing from a R2 unit that once belonged to Peggin Dulin and was later salvaged by Jawas. The droid was actually wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra. Ji'Ni Sil informed the spacer that the droid casing was already sold to a robonium miner. Despite the miner was killed by Tusken Raiders, the spacer finally managed to retrieve the casing.\nJi'Ni Sil was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ji'Ni Sil was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
