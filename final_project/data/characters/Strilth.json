 "content": "Strilth was a Houk male who worked for Rogun the Butcher during the Galactic War. He was sent to Nar Shaddaa to receive the captive slicer Combo from Raskurro the Hutt. However, a smuggler captain arrived to rescue him and killed Strilth.\nThe Houk Strilth was a lieutenant of the crime lord Rogun the Butcher during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Around 3642 BBY, he, along with his bodyguards, were dispatched to the planet Nar Shaddaa to secure the slicer Combo, who was being held by the Hutt Cartel in a safehouse. The Hutts hoped to collect the bounty Rogun had put on Combo, a member of a pirate crew that had had been raiding Rogun's ships.\nWhile Strilth was discussing the price Rogun would pay for the slicer with Raskurro the Hutt, a notorious smuggler captain also wanted by Rogun and Vaz Traniff, the leader of the pirate crew, arrived to rescue Combo. Raskurro was intrigued by their presence, angering Strilth. The Houk threatened the Hutt with death for dealing with an enemy of Rogun's. Raskurro replied that Strilth did not have the authority to start a war with the Hutts on Rogun's behalf, and smuggler used the threat to persuade the Hutt that they were a safer business partner. Raskurro agreed to work with them and left the two groups to settle the disagreement on their own. Strilth and his bodyguards attempted to kill the spacers, but were defeated.",
