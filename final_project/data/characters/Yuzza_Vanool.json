 "content": "Yuzza Vanool was a Human male captain who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Captain Vanool accidentally landed a transport on a Gungan leader, prompting the Gungans followers to enact retribution. Vana Sage later tasked a spacer with rescuing Captain Vanool from the vengeful Gungans.\nYuzza Vanool was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nYuzza Vanool spawned under the generic \"official\" template, resulting in him consistently appearing as a Human female. This contradicted Vana Sage quest dialogue, who consistently referred to Vanool as a male. This article assumes that Vanool is canonically a Human male in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and that the female depiction is erroneous.",
