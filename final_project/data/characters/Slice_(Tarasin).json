 "content": "Slice was a male Tarasin, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nSlice founded the business S\u0026N Music with fellow Tarasin Nivel, and they established a music distribution center in the city Hedrett on Cularin. They began selling recordings of Tarasin music to tourists, and business soon took off, because the recordings gained popularity among members of aquatic species. However, in c. 31 BBY, the Cularin system's senator, Lavina Wren announced that she was getting engaged, and the S\u0026N Music distribution center was subsequently graffitied with a statement that was hostile to the wedding. The graffiti angered Slice and Nivel, and they began cleaning it off.",
