 "content": "Kirma Umber was the wife of Baron Vla√ßan Umber. She began to feel that her husband may have had an affair with Dejah Duare, the partner of Caamasi artist Ves Volette. She went to see Volette alone to demand that he leave Dejah immediately, but he refused and Kirma left in a fury.\nKirma was one of the principal suspects in the murder Ves Volette, but was later exonerated after Jedi Knight Jax Pavan revealed that the killer was the Baroness' own protocol droid, who only wished to ease the suffering of its mistress.",
