 "content": "The Zabrak male Sanorn earned the rank of Sith Lord within the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. He worked on the space station known as Vaiken Spacedock, which was located within the Imperial fleet, where he sold equipment during the war to other Imperials. Working alongside other merchants in the supplies section of the station, Sanorn wore a black and white set of armor including a mask while working.\nSanorn was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he serves as an Imperial classic gear vendor within the Imperial fleet, and appears again in the same room as a Basic Gear vendor. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
