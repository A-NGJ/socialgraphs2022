 "content": "Ronko Bist was a male Trandoshan and a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Bist was the leader of a group of Separatists called the Free Trandoshans, and served as Count Dooku's liaison to the Bounty Hunters' Guild. During the Clone Wars, Bist was maimed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and arrested by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He was then imprisoned within The Prism.\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Gentis coup, Bist was released and became part of a brutal test created by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, to see who among the prisoners was worthy of joining the New Order. Bist was killed in the battle.",
