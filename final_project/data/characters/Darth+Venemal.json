 "content": "Darth Venemal was a Human male Sith Lord that served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. He served alongside the Sith Lord Darth Malgus during the Empire's attack on the planet Ord Radama, which was successful at first. However, the Sith forces led by Venemal and Malgus were not resupplied, and their fleet in orbit was attacked by Galactic Republic vessels. Venemal—who remained in the capital Livien Magnus while Malgus attempted to aid in the space battle—was killed with the city's populace when a crippled Imperial Harrower-class dreadnought crashed into Livien Magnus.\nDarth Venemal, a Human male, served as a Sith Lord in the resurgent Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, a galaxy–spanning conflict between the Empire and the Galactic Republic. In the year 3660 BBY, during the Empire's campaign to secure worlds in the Outer Rim Territories, Venemal and the Sith Lord Darth Malgus were tasked with leading Imperial forces—including a legion of soldiers and small fleet of Navy warships— to recapture the planet Ord Radama in the Esstran sector. During the Jedi Civil War approximately three hundred years earlier, the planet had been allied with the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak's Sith Empire, but was brought back into the Republic following the Jedi Civil War's end.\nTheir assault was initially successful and after about twenty days of fighting, their forces had captured the city Livien Magnus, Ord Radama's capital. The Dark Council dispatched Lord Adraas to assist Malgus and Venemal, and Adraas attempted to take credit for the pair's success.\nHowever, the Sith forces on the planet were not resupplied and they were eventually overcame; Venemal was killed when a Harrower-class dreadnought crashed in the center of Livien Magnus. Malgus could sense his pain and death, along with that of a hundred thousand others. The Sith Empire was forced to withdraw from Ord Radama, and Malgus received some of the blame for Venemal's death and the defeat.\nDarth Venemal was created by Daniel Wallace and was featured in the 2012 publication Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side. Wallace intended Venemal's name to be a reference to the \"Veni, vidi, vici\" quote of the statesman Julius Caesar.",
