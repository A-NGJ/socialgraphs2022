 "content": "Deavyn Gils was a male Rodian who lived during the Clone Wars and during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he reside onboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. In 1 ABY, Deavyn was attacked by malfunctioning droids on the lower level of Tansarii Point Station and lost his precious datapad while running to escape the droids. The datapad was very important for the Rodian since it contained images of people very close to him who died in the Clone Wars. Gils therefore hired a spacer to recover the datapad from the crazy droids. The spacer had to destroy a number of droids in the Droid Repair Center but finally retrieved the datapad and brought it back to a grateful Deavyn Gils.\nDeavyn Gils appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Deavyn Gils was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
