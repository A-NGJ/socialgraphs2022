 "content": "Dobbs was a Human male stormtrooper who served in the Imperial Military during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 BBY, he was assigned aboard the Star Destroyer Imperator where he served in the platoon assigned to Cadet leader Kyle Katarn.\nOnce the assault boat landed, Dobbs along with Trang and Sutu was assigned as a scout of his squad to check the area; he cursed his luck as this made him exposed, but he reported that he found nothing.\nHe participated in the ensuing battle on AX-456, after which only 6 survived.",
