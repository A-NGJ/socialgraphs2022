 "content": "Wilson Tchorshel was a male Mon Calamari Alliance Special Agent who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin, Wilson Tchorshel was the immediate superior of Captain Carh'la Bastra and was stationed in Kaadara, a city on Naboo. In 1 ABY, he worked with a Rebel spacer who had previously worked with Captain Bastra on Tatooine. Tchorshel tasked an operative with retrieving four experimental droid modules dating back to the time of the Old Republic. The objective of Tchorshel was to recreate a powerful droid artificial intelligence technology that was lost over the years. In the meantime, the droid modules were also wanted by the agents of Imperial Lieutenant Maximilian Vox. The spacer found the positional awareness triangulator chip in a mouse droid used by the Skaak Tippers in their hideout. The decentralized autonomy chip was given by the Hutt crime lord Borvo after the spacer managed to compromise the security of Borvo's Vault. The spacer recovered the strategy/tactics simulation chip after destroying a droideka in the Stonewall Labs headquarters, thanks to the assistance of Professor Zanier Hudmasse. Finally, the spacer retrieved the stochastic decision chip with the help of Boss Nass by destroying a super battle droid in possession of the Ultragungan Militia. The operative was successful and was then awarded the Medal of Bothawui by Wilson Tchorshel. With the four modules reunited, Tchorshel quickly left Naboo in order to transfer the AI modules to a Rebel research center.\nWilson Tchorshel was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Wilson Tchorshel was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
