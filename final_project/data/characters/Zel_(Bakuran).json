 "content": "Zel was one of the leaders of the Freedom movement, serving Malinza Thanas during the height of the Yuuzhan Vong War. When Malinza escaped from jail, with the help of Jedi Jaina Solo, it was Zel's hot temper that led him to accuse Jaina of betraying them. It was only when a homing beacon was found sewn into the waistband of Malinza's pants did Zel relent. Zel was killed by Bakuran police when the location of the Stack was revealed. The police raided the Stack, and Zel was shot while trying to flee.",
