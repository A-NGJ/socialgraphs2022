 "content": "Pendo was a male Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order following the New Sith Wars and the Ruusan Reformation.\nIdentified as Force-sensitive and trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, Pendo was serving the Order and the Republic as a Knight by 980 BBY. An agent of the Council of First Knowledge, Pendo was active in the Council's hunt for dark side artifacts left over from the New Sith Wars. Under the leadership of Caretaker Restelly Quist, the agents of the Council were stationed out of the Temple's Tower of First Knowledge from which they went out across the galaxy in an attempt to purge all memory of the Sith from the collective memory of the galactic community.\nWhen Princess Serra of Doan arrived at the Temple to meet with Councilor Obba, Pendo and fellow Knights Ma'ya and Winnoa met the Doan delegation on the landing platform at the base of the tower. Escorting their guests to the greenhouse-like living quarters of the esteemed Ithorian Master, the three Knights waited in meditation outside of the chambers while the brief conference took place. When the meeting concluded, Master Obba emerged and dismissed the Jedi, allowing them to return to their duties higher in the tower.",
