 "content": "Droog'an was a Yuuzhan Vong warrior during the Yuuzhan Vong War, who fought at the Battle of Ebaq.\nDroog'an was the Commander of the Yuuzhan Vong Battle Group of Yun-Q'aah, during the Battle of Ebaq. When the fleet from the Smugglers' Alliance arrived, he asked Warmaster Tsavong Lah if they were being ambushed. Lah initially thought it was cowardice on the part of Droog'an, but after briefly considering that the commander might be right, he dismissed it. The Battle Group of Yun-Q'aah managed to avoid most of the mines set up by the New Republic Defense Fleet, though it is unknown if Commander Droog'an survived the battle.",
