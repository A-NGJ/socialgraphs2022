 "content": "Krugon was a Human male scout who was active during the reign of the New Republic. Krugon was a light-skinned individual who was bald, although he sported a red mustache and black eyebrows. He also had green colored eyes. Krugon had a silver-colored marking on his nose, and he wore a silver neck-guard. Krugon also made use of gray-colored body armor, along with bluish-gray clothing and dark-colored pants. As a scout, he wielded weapons such as a Bryar pistol and an E-11 blaster rifle.\nKrugon first appeared in the 1997 computer game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II as a character who only appeared in the game's multiplayer addition as a playable character model. He appeared again in Jedi Knight's expansion pack, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith. Mysteries of the Sith introduced \"multiplayer personalities,\" a form of character creation that put different character models under different professions, with each profession being assigned their own set of starting weapons for a match. In the game, Krugon was categorized as a scout. Due to his multiplayer only appearances, Krugon's place in canon is uncertain.",
