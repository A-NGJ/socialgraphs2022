 "content": "A Human male mercenary was a non-Force-sensitive member of the Brotherhood of Darkness. He fled from the Seventh Battle of Ruusan after the Army of Light managed to break through the Brotherhood's defenses, and returned to the Sith camp. While scavenging treasures and supplies, his group of mercenaries was attacked by Darth Bane.\nThe mercenary and his female companion were the only survivors of the attack; five other mercenaries having been slaughtered by Bane. The two mercenaries were later taken prisoner by the Jedi, who did not believe their words regarding the survival of the Sith, taking into account the two's unflattering reputation.",
