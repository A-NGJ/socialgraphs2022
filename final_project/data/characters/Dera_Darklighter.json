 "content": "Dera Darklighter was a Human female who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. She was the daughter of Huff Darklighter and his second wife and the younger half-sister of Biggs Darklighter.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Dera Darklighter secretly joined the Rebel Alliance after the death of Biggs Darklighter at the Battle of Yavin. She was not enough skilled to become a pilot but her charisma and enthusiasm made her a very good speaker. She thus encouraged people from Tatooine to join the Rebellion. Dera also tried, unsuccessfully, to convince her father to stop working with Jabba the Hutt, in order to limit criminality and corruption on Tatooine. Therefore, she decided to use her father's connections with Jabba's henchmen to learn how to fight the Hutt, and possibly help the Rebellion. She managed to provide smuggled items and information about Imperial forces for the Alliance.\nIn 1 ABY, she had an obsession with Tusken Raiders. She employed a spacer to eradicate a tribe of dangerous Sand Peoples dwelling within a cave near their home.\nDera Darklighter appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. With the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005, Dera Darklighter was incorporated into the revamped Darklighter's Estate questline.",
