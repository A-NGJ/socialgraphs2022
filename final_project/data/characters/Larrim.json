 "content": "Larrim Twi'lek male who lived on the planet Taris during the Jedi Civil War. He owned and ran a kiosk in the South Apartments of the Upper City, where he sold various goods to residents and passers-by. In 3956 BBY, he met Galactic Republic soldiers Revan and Carth Onasi, telling them about himself and advertising the items he had for sale.\nLarrim lived on the Outer Rim world of Taris. The Human residents of the ecumenopolis were speciesist, and it was illegal for non-Humans to live in the Upper City. Despite this, Larrim, along with several other illegal aliens, lived in the Upper City's South Apartments, as they were the only ones who would rent in such a run down location. The authorities found it to be too much trouble, and did not persecute the aliens living there. He operated a small kiosk where he sold medpacs, armor suits, swords, blasters, grenades, mines, and a rare, expensive, and hi-tech personal energy shield.\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, Taris was occupied by the Sith Empire. In 3956 BBY, following a battle overhead, several escape pods belonging to the Galactic Republic crashed down on the planet. One of these pods contained Bastila Shan, a Jedi Padawan who's battle meditation was a key part to the Republic war effort. Attempting to trap her on the planet, the Sith declared martial law and placed Taris under quarantine. The new rulers vowed to uphold the Tarisians' traditions, but ended up relaxing the laws regarding aliens. Several days after the battle, former Sith Lord Revan, with the personality of a Republic soldier, and soldier Carth Onasi were taking refuge in the South Apartments.\nLarrim, at his kiosk, approached the pair when they walked by. He introduced himself to Revan, who reciprocated the gesture. Revan asked about his kiosk and the illegal aliens. Larrim gladly assisted Revan with these matters, and was willing to barter with him. He was, however, reluctant to answer too many questions unrelated to business for fear of losing the trust of potential buyers.\nLarrim was a green-skinned and gray-eyed male Twi'lek. He wore his lekku wrapped around his neck.\nLarrim tried to avoid answering questions not related to himself or his stock, as he feared losing the trust of his customers. Instead, he redirected these questions to Kadir the janitor, who he described as \"bordering on senile.\" Larrim was unafraid of being caught by Tarisian authorities, knowing they had long ago turned a blind eye to the South Apartments. In addition to speaking his native Huttese language, Larrim was able to understand Galactic Basic Standard.\nLarrim first appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. If the player walks by his kiosk, he will speak to Revan in an unavoidable encounter. The player may select several dialogue choices, but the conversation does not progress any plot or quest, nor does it change the player's alignment.",
