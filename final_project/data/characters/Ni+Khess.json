 "content": "Ni Khess was a Yuuzhan Vong, probably of the warrior caste. He wore vonduun crab armor and had earned the insignia of significant escalation, and he was almost certainly involved in his people's invasion of the galaxy in 25â€“30 ABY.\nNi Khess is one of the \"Rogue's Gallery\" of Yuuzhan Vong featured Star Wars Gamer 8. His name was supplied in the title of the image NiKhess.jpg on the old version of Jeffery Carlisle's website, now apparently only available in the caches at archive.org.\n\"Ni Khess\" is, possibly, named after Nick Hess, creator of the Yuuzhan Vong Database.",
