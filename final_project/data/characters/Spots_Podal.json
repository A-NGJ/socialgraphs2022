 "content": "Spots Podal was a Gotal male who resided on the galactic capital of Coruscant during the Clone Wars. During the war, Podal encountered Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was on the run from the Coruscant Security Force, in the Coruscant Underworld. He exchanged his cloak for some food from Tano.\nSpots Podal first appeared in the episode \"To Catch a Jedi\" of the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, in the program's fifth season. The episode aired on February 23, 2013. Although he was not identified in the actual episode, Podal's name was revealed in the episode's accompanying guide on StarWars.com. He was voiced by Supervising Director Dave Filoni. Filoni—who had previously voiced the mercenaries Embo and Jakoli in the episodes \"Bounty Hunters\" and \"The Box\"—has noted that he is reluctant to provide voicework for various characters in the series.",
