 "content": "Quasar was a Human male who captained a commercial pleasure cruiser during the time of the Galactic Republic, which transported important dignitaries and lowlifes alike. Quasar's ship once carried Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on a trip to Alderaan. On that voyage, Quasar's ship was threatened by pirates in the Merson asteroid belt, leading the captain to cede control of his ship to Kenobi, who fought off the raiders.\nA Human male, the man known as Quasar went into business as the captain of a pleasure cruiser during the era of the Galactic Republic. Quasar operated during an era where the hyperlanes were relatively safe, and large pleasure cruisers that transported beings from all walks of life between planets were common. Quasar's cruiser hosted politicians, criminals, and one on occasion, a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on his way to Alderaan. On that eventful trip, Quasar asked Kenobi to escort a protocol droid called 68-RKO, which was en route to enter the service of King Bail Organa, as a form of recompense for the fact that Kenobi was traveling at a very cheap rate. Kenobi consented, although the droid's presence caused a fight between the Jedi and a droid-hating fellow passenger that ended when Kenobi ran the man through with his lightsaber.\nSoon afterward, Quasar sent for Kenobi directly, asking for the Jedi's help during a perilous stage of their journey. The cruiser's path to Alderaan took it through the Merson asteroid belt, which was inhabited by notorious pirates that preyed on passing ships. It was common practice for ships coming through the belt to shut down their non-essential systems and silently drift along with the asteroids, disguising their presence. However, on this occasion, Quasar noticed a group of four pirate ships seemingly following them, an extremely unusual occurrence. Unsure of what to do, Quasar asked for Kenobi's counsel, and soon ceded command of the bridge to the Jedi when the pirates suddenly turned to attack. Quasar was amazed when Kenobi deftly fought off the pirates with just a pair of energy cannons, before the Jedi left the bridge to investigate his suspicion that the bandits were following a signal originating from within Quasar's ship. Kenobi soon found the culprit: a microwave emitter originating from a fermentation device at the ship's bar.\nAlthough Quasar served as the captain of his pleasure cruiser, he was not above turning to others for advice when faced with a situation he did not know how to handle, and especially respected the counsel of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. And when the the situation threatened violence, as it did in the Merson asteroid belt, Quasar was willing to turn over command of his ship entirely, as he had absolutely no schooling or experience in warfare.\nQuasar made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Star Wars  24, written by Mary Jo Duffy and released in 1979. Quasar was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
