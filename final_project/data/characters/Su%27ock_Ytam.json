 "content": "Su'ock Ytam was a male Sullustan, who lived on the moon Tilnes during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nYtam lived in TX-38, an underground town, where he worked in a MephitaPharma, Inc. chemical factory, as a chemist. However, when the factory closed and the town was abandoned, Ytam stayed behind and lived there by himself. When the Heroes of Cularin came to TX-38 during the Clone Wars, while trying to find the Jedi Nek Lawsirk, they spoke to Ytam and he directed them to the factory.\nAs a result of spending too much time around chemicals, Ytam became slightly mad. He was paranoid and had a short attention span.",
