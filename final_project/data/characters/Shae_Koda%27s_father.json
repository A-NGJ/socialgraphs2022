 "content": "The father of Shae Koda was a Human male who was a member of the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython. Lightly-skinned with orange hair and a green triangle tattoo on his forehead, he and his wife were of Dathomiri descent, and had a daughter named Shae Koda sometime before the year 25,805 BBY, when the Twi'lek Despot Queen Hadiya attempted to conquer the Tython system in the Despot War. Koda's father and mother fought the Despot Army on Tython, but both were killed by Hadiya personally at the gates of Kaleth, the Temple of Knowledge.\nThough the Despot War ended with a Je'daii victory, Koda grew up an orphan and resented her parents for abandoning her. In 25,793 BBY, while in the Rift—a ravine on Tython saturated with the dark side—Koda encountered visions of her parents and attacked them in rage. In 25,792 BBY, Koda's parents appeared in a vision to her in the depths of the Chasm on Tython.\nShae Koda's father was first mentioned in Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0, a prequel issue for the comic book series Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi, and he first appeared in a vision in the 2012 comic book Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4; her parents were also mentioned in the sixth issue of the series.",
