 "content": "Veris was a tattooed, female Human who underwent surgery to make her look like a Devaronian, and she acted as a double for Ushka Et, the Devaronian leader singer of the band Distraction. After Distraction became scheduled to hold a concert aboard the Hutt yacht Sleemo Poya Jeedai, Veris and doubles of the other band members traveled to the yacht, as part of a security ploy. However, the assassin Niklas Cories planned to attack the Sleemo Poya Jeedai during the concert, so he killed Veris and captured Et, allowing him to disguise himself as Et and infiltrate the concert.",
