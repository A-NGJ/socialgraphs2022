 "content": "A Hynestian male worked as a guard in the Hynestian royal dungeon. He was accompanied by Twyla as he delivered soup to Landonis Balthazar Calrissian and Zel Gris when they were being held as prisoners. Later, he discovered Calrissian escaping, but was knocked into a wall by L3-37 after being fooled by Rinetta Gan into thinking she was being kidnapped by Calrissian. Rendered unconscious, he was bound and locked in a cell by the fugitives.",
