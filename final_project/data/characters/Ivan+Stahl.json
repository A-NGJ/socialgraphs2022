 "content": "Ivan Stahl was a Human male who was among those attempting to settle in the Tularan Marsh region of the planet Taris during the Taris Resettlement Initiative. Stahl's settlement was attacked by pirates who fed his family to the native rakghouls, weakening Stahl's hold on sanity; he and the survivors, such as Dana Hunt, were forced to flee to the Galactic Republic's Brejik's Run Outpost, where Hunt recruited help in recovering equipment from the pirates so that they could start a new settlement.",
