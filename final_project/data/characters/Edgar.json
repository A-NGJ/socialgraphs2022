 "content": "Edgar was an Imperial officer that lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nEdgar appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nOfficer Edgar was intended to be the Imperial quest giver for the fifth and final chapter of the story arc \"Secrets of the Syren\". This chapter was achieving its development in October 2005 but was delayed and planned to be introduced in April 2006 with the \"Publish 28\". Officer Edgar and Dak Ralter, the Rebel quest giver, were both added to the game with the Publish 28, released on April 26, 2006. Nevertheless, the final chapter of \"Secrets of the Syren\" was never released and these NPCs did not provide any quest.",
