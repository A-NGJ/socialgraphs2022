 "content": "Arven Wendik was a human male who served as a lieutenant and pilot in Bravo Squadron of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps. After the planet Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation in 32 BBY, Wendik flew in an N-1 starfighter as Bravo 3 during the Battle of Naboo. He and the rest of Bravo Flight were tasked with destroying Vuutun Palaa, a Lucrehulk-class Battleship controlling the Trade Federation Droid Army; however, they found themselves unable to damage it until the young boy Anakin Skywalker destroyed the battleship from within. Wendik survived the battle and celebrated the victory.\nLieutenant Arven Wendik was a Human male who served as a pilot in the Royal Space Fighter Corps of the Royal Naboo Security Forces on the planet Naboo during the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo in 32 BBY. Wendik flew as part of Bravo Squadron, assisting commander Ric Olié, alongside fellow lieutenants Dineé Ellberger and Lutin Hollis. Only a few of the pilots avoided capture during the Trade Federation's invasion, but after Olié and Queen Padmé Amidala returned from seeking aid on the planet Coruscant, some of the captive pilots were then freed and a plan was formed to retake Naboo with the aid of the native Gungans.\nWhile the Gungan Grand Army distracted the Trade Federation Droid Army, Amidala led a force including Wendik and the rest of Bravo Flight into Theed, the capital of Naboo. The group used hidden passages to reach the Theed Hangar, where they destroyed the battle droids standing guard so that Bravo Flight could launch the N-1 starfighters being kept in the hangar. Wendik piloted one of the starfighters as Bravo Flight then left Naboo's atmosphere in order to try and destroy the Vuutun Palaa, a Lucrehulk-class Battleship that was controlling all of the Federation's droid forces. Wendik flew as Bravo 3 during the ensuing battle, in which the Naboo pilots engaged the vulture droids deployed by the battleship, but found that their target's deflector shield was too strong for them to cause any damage.\nHowever, the pilots were surprised when the Trade Federation vessel began to detonate from within despite their lack of success in damaging it. The destruction had been instead caused by the young child Anakin Skywalker and the astromech droid R2-D2, who had been brought to the battle by a N-1 starfighter's autopilot and ended up flying inside the Vuutun Palaa and then destroying it from within. Wendik spotted Skywalker's fighter exiting the detonating battleship after which he, Skywalker, and the rest of Bravo Flight flew away from the Vuutun Palaa and celebrated as it exploded. The ship's destruction caused the deactivation of the Federation's droid forces below on Naboo and led to a victory over the Trade Federation and the liberation of the world.\nArven Wendik had dark skin and brown eyes. After destroying the Vuutun Palaa, he celebrated with a quieter exclamation as other pilots cheered and hollered.\nWhile flying an N-1 starfighter in the Battle of Naboo, Wendik wore a brown Fighter Corps Flying Helmet with the flying goggles down and the orange flying jacket of the corps's uniform.\nArven Wendik was portrayed by Clarence Smith in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. The character was credited only as \"Fighter Pilot Bravo 3\" in the film, and in the new Star Wars canon his full name was used in the thirty-thirst issue of the Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon magazine, which was published by De Agostini around August 5, 2015. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on a card in the 2001 Theed Palace Limited set of the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game. In the 2022 non-canon video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, Wendik appears during an adaptation of his scene from The Phantom Menace, but is depicted with light colored skin rather than dark.",
