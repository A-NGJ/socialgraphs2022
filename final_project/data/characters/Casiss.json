 "content": "Casiss was a male Felucian who was the leader of a Nysillin farming community on Felucia.\nIn 22 BBY, his village was troubled by pirates under the leadership of Hondo Ohnaka, demanding the farmers' crops, which led him to hire the services of Sugi and her band of bounty hunters. When Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano arrived in the village, Casiss convinced the Jedi to work with the bounty hunters to finally drive off the pirates. The Jedi trained the villagers to use spears and slingshots to defend themselves and they successfully fought back against the pirates, freeing themselves from the fear of future attacks.\nGregory Baldwin lent his voice to Casiss, and also voiced Seripas in the \"Bounty Hunters\" episode. In accordance to the role, as well as the episode's homage, he uses a voice similar to that of the late Mako Iwamatsu.",
