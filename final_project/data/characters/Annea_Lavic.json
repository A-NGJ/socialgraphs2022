 "content": "Annea Lavic was a former medical student at the Rhinnal State Medical Academy who fled to the Outer Rim Territories after she accidentally killed the son of a Imperial Governor's chief aide during a medical procedure.\nAnnea Lavic was a medical student at the Rhinnal State Medical Academy. She struggled through the school's rigorous program and barely passed most of her progress checks. To relieve the pressure of school, Lavic turned to Ryll spice and financed her drug use through gambling and minor theft. During an internship at a prominent Rhinnal hospital, Lavic's drug use cost her a promising medical career. The son of the resident Imperial Governor's chief aide was involved in a terrible speeder accident and was hospitalized. Lavic was part of the team trying to save the boy's life, but her drug addiction prevented her from concentrating. Due to her miscalculation and hurried medical procedures, she killed the aide's son. Rather than face the consequences, Lavic fled the Core Worlds.\nLavic spent a whole year hiding in backwater star systems in the Outer Rim Territories, before she tried establishing her own practice on a small colony. She fled the settlement after a bad deal with some spice smugglers. After that, she wandered between systems, rarely staying anywhere for long, taking on whatever patients sought her out in order to pay for room, food, gambling debts and drug use â€“ usually people in desperate need of discreet medical care. At some point, she caught the attention of smuggler Platt Okeefe, who included Lavic in her list of contacts in the Smuggler's Handbook.\nWallowing in guilt about the past had given Lavic a grim outlook on life. She gave her patients the best care she possibly could, at least for someone in her condition. However, she always warned them that the result probably wouldn't be good. She spent most of her time in cantinas looking for passage to another planet. Lavic was susceptible to depression and when it became too much for her to bear, she would spend days in an hallucinating stupor in an alley or abandoned warehouse.",
