 "content": "A humanoid female was the mother of the future Sith Lord Sadic. She and her husband were considered to be low-class within the Sith Empire, essentially one step above slaves. Despite this, their son demonstrated Force-sensitivity and was taken to the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban for training.\nSadic's mother was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Sadic in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. Her species, and that of her son, is never specified, nor is her name.",
