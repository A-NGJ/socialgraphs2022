 "content": "Horoth Gendi was a male Nikto who was the slave of a Hutt well before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Gendi saved the life of his Hutt master in an act of quick-thinking bloodshed, and in reward the Hutt formally bequeathed the Nikto Sector, a region of the city-moon Nar Shaddaa that had been known as a place for Nikto warriors to visit in order to gain employers, to Gendi. Gendi formed his own gang and used their aid to free himself from servitude, and a succession of Nikto gangs assumed control of the Nikto Sector in the years that followed.\nHoroth Gendi was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Nikto Sector in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011.",
