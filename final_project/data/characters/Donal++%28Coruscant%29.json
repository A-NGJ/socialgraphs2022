 "content": "Donal was a male Human native of Coruscant during the first years of the Galactic Empire. After the Great Jedi Purge began and the Jedi Temple was emptied, Donal met up with the woman named Solace. Solace, who in reality was former Jedi Master Fy-Tor-Ana, was forming a resistance group in the planet's crust.\nWhen Solace agreed to accompany former Jedi Ferus Olin to the Jedi Temple in an effort to prevent Inquisitor Malorum from discovering the underground settlement, Donal accepted Solace's request to stay as guardian and leader of the camp. When the two Jedi returned to the settlement and found it in ruins, Solace felt that Donal had been a double-agent planted by Malorum.",
