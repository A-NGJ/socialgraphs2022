 "content": "Cassa Hun was a male Twi'lek Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. During his time on the Republic Navy staging area of Carrick Station and the Republic capital planet of Coruscant, Hun trained young Jedi Knights to become either Jedi Sentinels or Jedi Guardians.\nA Twi'lek Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the Sith Empire, Cassa Hun traveled between the Republic Navy's Carrick Station and the Republic capital planet of Coruscant frequently. On Carrick Station, Hun's friend and fellow Jedi Master, Nimi, often directed newly-arrived Jedi Knights to speak with the Twi'lek Jedi about undergoing training to become either a Jedi Sentinel or Jedi Guardian. Hun would teach those Knights about the two training paths, and he frequently gave his students an additional lightsaber if they chose to become a Sentinel, or additional armor if they chose the path of a Guardian. One such student in 3643 BBY was the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din, and the newly-Knighted Jedi spoke with Hun on either Coruscant or Carrick Station not long after departing the Jedi Order's homeworld of Tython.\nA male Lethan Twi'lek, Cassa Hun had pinkish-red skin and green eyes, and the Jedi wore tan robes while carrying his single lightsaber. He spoke Twi'leki instead of Galactic Basic Standard, and he put his knowledge of Jedi training and philosophy to use while teaching young Knights of the Order.\nCassa Hun first appeared in the BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as the Advanced Class Trainer for the Jedi Knight. He appears on both Carrick Station and the planet Coruscant, though as the player receives the mission \"Advanced Training\" on the space station, this article assumes Hun met with the player on Carrick Station. Upon speaking with Hun, the player decides to pursue either the Guardian or Sentinel advanced class and then receives the chosen class's additional gear, and both of Hun's locations are marked in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide that was released alongside the game in 2011. Hun and the rest of the Advanced Class Trainers were removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, when advanced classes were made available on character creation rather than level 10.",
