 "content": "The gundark known as the Dark Beast was native to the Jedi homeworld of Tython.\nThe only known sighting of the Dark Beast was in the Cold War, in the caves near Vur Tepe on Tython, where it attacked a Jedi Padawan who was selecting a lightsaber crystal from the cave's crystal formations. It was killed by the Consular and its companion Qyzen Fess, who were traveling through the cave to the Forge to craft their lightsaber.",
