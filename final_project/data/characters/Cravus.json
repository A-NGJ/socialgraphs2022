Known as a cruel ruler, Cravus brutally took control of the planet with a collection of battle droids.\nRuling from Fort Cravus, the warlord led his forces to take complete control of the world. After his death, the fortress remained; his ancient droids lying beneath its surface in the lower chambers.",
