 "content": "CT-57/11-9048 was a clone trooper pilot who served in the Galactic Republic's 127th Gunship Wing during the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY, he fought on the planet Cato Neimoidia, flying an ARC-170 starfighter. When Order 66 was issued by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, CT-57/11-9048 and Captain CT-55/11-9009 killed their commanding officer, Jedi Master Plo Koon, while they were escorting him on a patrol of the planet's bridge cities.\nCT-57/11-9048 was a clone trooper pilot who served in the Grand Army of the Republic and the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars. One of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett who were bred on the planet Kamino for warfare, CT-57/11-9048 served as the wingman of Captain CT-55/11-9009—nicknamed \"Jag\"—in the 127th Gunship Wing. In 19 BBY, he fought in a battle on Cato Neimoidia, a Neimoidian purse world, serving under Jedi General Plo Koon. During the battle, CT-57/11-9048 and Jag accompanied Koon on an aerial patrol of Cato Neimoidia's bridge cities.\nThe two clones flew ARC-170 starfighters, while Koon piloted a Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor. As they proceeded with the patrol, the clones received a transmission from the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who ordered them to execute Order 66, which dictated all clones to kill their Jedi leaders. CT-57/11-9048 and Jag complied and shot down Koon's starfighter, and it crashed into a clone training center, killing both the Jedi Master and 141 clone troopers stationed there. Moff Marcellin Wessel later filed a report on CT-57/11-9048 and Jag's actions to Palpatine, who had become the Emperor of the newly proclaimed Galactic Empire.\nLike all of Jango Fett's clones, CT-57/11-9048 stood 1.83 meters tall.\nCT-57/11-9048 was first mentioned in the article Order 66: Destroy All Jedi, written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 87 in April of 2006. The clone trooper later received an entry in the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
