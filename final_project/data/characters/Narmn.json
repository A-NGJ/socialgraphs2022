 "content": "Narmn was a green-skinned male Twi'lek from Ryloth who resided in a remote village. He stood guard for the village and was present when Drua—a fellow villager—welcomed Darth Sidious, Darth Vader and Erstin Deez to their village. The Twi'leks, however, were unaware of the trio's actual identities as Imperials, and Sidious presented himself and Vader under pseudonyms in Sith tongue that meant \"death\" and \"fate,\" respectively. Unbeknown to Narmn or the rest of the villagers, the Sith Lords were on a mission to quell the Free Ryloth Movement, and soon they all witnessed a skirmish between the two factions. To leave no witnesses to the events that transpired, Sidious—the Galactic Emperor—commanded Vader to kill every last villager, which included Narmn.",
