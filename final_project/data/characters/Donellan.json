 "content": "Donellan was a male individual who lived on the planet Kesh during the Post-Manderon period. The son of Grand Lord Nida Korsin and her consort, he was the heir to the throne of the Lost Tribe of Sith. However, he died as an old man, before he could become the leader of the tribe, and following his passing, Nida Korsin replaced the tribe's dynastic succession system with one that was based on merit.\nThe Lost Tribe of Sith later established the celebration Donellan's Day, to commemorate the birth of Donellan, and to serve as a warning for Sith who chose to be too patient when trying to engineer their own ascensions.",
