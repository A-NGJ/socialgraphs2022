 "content": "Ved Foslo was a male human who was a native of the planet Coruscant, and son of the Imperial General Foslo. Ved attended the Royal Imperial Academy in the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War. His roommates were Thane Kyrell and Nash Windrider. During his time at the Academy, Foslo was ranked near top of his class, showing an excellence in mechanical expertise. However, he usually fell short of ranking higher in class exercises to Kyrell and another classmate, Ciena Ree, much to his chagrin.\nAfter graduating from the Academy in the weeks prior to the Battle of Yavin, Foslo became a top weapons expert for the Empire. Following the Battle of Jakku, he designed newer weapons systems that were refitted into the Imperial Navy's TIE fighters making them much more powerful than ever before.\nVed Foslo was the son of the Imperial General Foslo, who worked in central intelligence. When he was around sixteen years old, the younger Foslo became an Imperial cadet at the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, which was regarded as the most prestigious Imperial Academy in the Galactic Empire. When the Jelucani cadet Thane Kyrell rang the door chime outside their dormitory unit, Foslo chided him for ringing the chime to his own quarters. Foslo was cold towards the newcomer, in contrast to his Alderaanian roommate Nash Windrider, who was friendly towards Thane.\nDuring his time at the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved took notice of the close friendship between Thane and his fellow Jelucani Ciena Ree. Jealous of the two cadet's high marks, Foslo once taunted Thane for allowing Ciena to claim the top spot in the flying class. When Thane responded that there was room for more than one of them in the graduation class and reminded him that the Empire wanted to create the best officers, Ved responded that one day he would understand. Nash then pointed out that Foslo was jealous of Thane and Ciena's higher marks and mockingly asked Foslo about his father's rank.\nLater, Foslo attended a Small Craft Flight class which involved the cadets riding speeder bikes through Reitgen Hoops. When Ciena and Thane managed to win the race despite their speeder bikes being stuck together, Foslo threw his helmet down in disgust while the other cadets cheered.\nWhen the cadets were tasked with the laser cannon project, Foslo was determined to succeed. When Commander Harn began judging the projects, he described Foslo's efforts as \"innovative,\" which greatly pleased him. When it was revealed that Thane's project had been sabotaged, Thane and Ciena initially believed that he had been the one who sabotaged it due to his constant antagonism. In truth, the sabotage had been perpetrated by the Academy's Office of Student Outcomes, which wanted to discourage local loyalties among the student population.\nPrior to graduation, Foslo along with Thane, Ciena, and Jude Edivon were among a select group of Imperial cadets invited to attend a ball at the Imperial Palace, the residence of Emperor Palpatine and the former Jedi Temple. During the function, Foslo took the opportunity to wear the latest Coruscant fashion: a long cape, wide silky shirt, and other accessories. At the ball, Foslo mocked Thane and Ciena for letting their relationship be affected by the laser cannon incident. He revealed that the Academy's cadets had engineered the incident in order to weaken local ties and to strengthen their commitment to the Empire. Despite Foslo's harsh tone, Thane and Ciena realized that he was right and reconciled.\nAfter graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved Foslo became a weapons expert who developed new weapons for the Imperial Navy. Following the Battle of Jakku, he developed TIE fighters that were capable of punching through energy shields and starfighter hulls with a single blast. Following the Battle of Jakku, Foslo along with his former roommate Commander Nash Windrider joined the Imperial remnant that regrouped in the Queluhan Nebula for an assault on the New Republic, the successor to the Rebel Alliance. At some point in his service within the Empire, Foslo piloted a TIE Advanced x1.\nVed Foslo was a male human. In his youth, he had a slim physique, black hair, and a narrow face. Foslo liked to boast of his father General Foslo's high ranking position. As a Core Worlder, Foslo looked down on people from the Outer Rim Territories such as Thane Kyrell and Ciena. According to Thane, he never relaxed and even wore his pajamas to the neck. Foslo was known for his clean habits, his lack of a snoring problem, and his knowledge of the fine points of military culture on Coruscant. Foslo was also familiar with the night clubs on Coruscant.\nIn his youth, Foslo liked to keep up with fashion. While Nash believed that Foslo had risen through the ranks due to his father's interference, Foslo had a technical aptitude and became a weapons expert. While Nash chafed under Foslo's adolescent arrogance, he regarded Foslo's arrogance as completely insufferable in adulthood. Still, Nash regarded Foslo as preferable to his former friend Thane Kyrell, who had joined the Rebel Alliance and New Republic.\nVed Foslo first appeared in the canon novel Lost Stars, as part of Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was written by Claudia Gray and published in 2015.\nWhile writing the novel, Gray pictured Foslo as being portrayed by Harry Shum Jr..",
