 "content": "Murzz, a young Tatooinian boy, was one of the children enslaved by Gilramos Libkath. He was used as an example by Libkath of what would become of the other children if he did not receive absolute obedience from them. Libkath ordered Murzz to steal seventeen crates of missiles from Jabba the Hutt, but they were only able to steal sixteen. An enraged Libkath attempted to punish Murzz but he was stopped by the arrival of bounty hunters Boba Fett and Durge, sent by Jabba to kill him. Following Libkath's death and the destruction of his Tatooine stronghold, Murzz escaped with Boba and the rest of the children.",
