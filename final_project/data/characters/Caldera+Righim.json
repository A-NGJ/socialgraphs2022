 "content": "Caldera Righim was a Talz. He resided on Tatooine, and was often spotted enjoying a drink at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. He was often present during the night when Ackmena was the bartender. Like most Talz, Caldera was a pacifist. He was a good friend of Wuher.\nDecipher used Caldera's picture to replace Muftak. This is the Talz from the Holiday Special and another example of Decipher's 'background magic'.\nThe picture under Muftak's entry in The Essential Guide to Characters is actually a picture of Righim, as evidenced by the sash across his shoulder which Muftak does not wear.\nCullatran was a name used during production of The Star Wars Holiday Special, but it was never officially confirmed.\nFor a long time, Caldera Righim's canon name was not known. \"Caldera Righim\" is an anagram of Michael Girard, a Decipher employee. Muftak was originally going to be named Cullatran, and the name was instead used as an unofficial name for the character in the holiday special. Starwarsholidayspecial.com used the discarded name to identify this character.",
