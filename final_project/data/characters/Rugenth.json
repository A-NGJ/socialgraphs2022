 "content": "Rugenth was a male Human who held the rank of Moff in the Imperial Military of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. Serving on the planet Quesh during the Quesh war, Rugenth dispatched Bravo Team to destroy a Galactic Republic walker convoy. Athough they were killed before they finished the mission, other Imperials in the area completed the assignment and reported success to Rugenth.\nMoff Rugenth appears on Quesh in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, where he gives Imperial players the mission \"Walker Tripping.\" Rugenth's role in the mission was originally filled by Moff Dracen; Rugenth's NPC is still labeled as moff_dracen within the game's files.",
