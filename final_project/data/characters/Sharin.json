 "content": "Sharin was a human female who served as a major within the Imperial Security Bureau during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Sharin was sent by Emperor Palpatine to review the security procedures being undertaken at the various black facilities of the Empire after the defeat of Ellian Zahra. The first location Sharin traveled to was the second Death Star where the major spoke with the station's commander, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod. After being informed of the measures the Death Star had been undertaking, Sharin informed the moff that his security was tight and passed Sharin's inspection. Sharin then made her way to a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle where she was to travel to Al'doleem to investigate a recent incident at Mount Pasvaal. As Sharin made her way to the ships pilot, Sharin discovered the pilot was not her designated pilot. After this, Bevelyn, a worker aboard the Death Star who was attempting to leave the station with her partner Jon Melton, who was disguised as Sharin's pilot, grabbed hold of Sharin and snapped her neck, killing Sharin. Melton then piloted the shuttle away from the Death Star.",
