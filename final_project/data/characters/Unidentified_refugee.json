 "content": "This female refugee from Artorias was located on the planet Shramar during the Yuuzhan Vong War. After Kaye Galfridian and Arbeloa disembarked from the Heart of Artorias, she rushed through the line of Stormtroopers that were watching the landing and attempted to talk to the Princess. She was shot in the back by the Imperial forces.\nDespite the aggressive action, Galfridian decided to head back to her ship. Arbeloa went to retrieve the corpse of the girl and realized she was still alive. He cautioned her to remain still despite her pain so he could take her onboard the Heart.\nOnce on the ship, she was treated by medical personnel and explained that the refugees on the planet were forced into slavery.",
