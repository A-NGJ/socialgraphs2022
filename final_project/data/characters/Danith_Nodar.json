 "content": "Danith Nodar was a human female who served as a corporal and swamp trooper in the Galactic Empire's 224th Imperial Armored Division during the Mimban Campaign. She had previously graduated from Carida Academy and was deployed to Marca until she was rotated out to Mimban as punishment due to insubordination. She unloaded her frustrations at the Mimbanese Liberation Army, and her ferocity during combat made her squadmates uneasy, but impressed her higher-ups.",
