 "content": "Omacala was a Gotal male who resided on the planet Coruscant during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Omacala ran the Umbra Club, a cantina and nightclub situated within Sector 1459 of the Coruscant underworld, and he paid a lot of attention to the activities and conversations of the cantina's patrons. During the Galactic Civil War, Omacala encountered a band of Pyke Syndicate operatives who were seeking to track down the Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos, and in return for credits, he supplied them with some information. He was, however, reluctant to discuss the Black Sun in detail.\nThe player characters can ask Omacala the following questions: \"What do you know about Black Sun?\", \"What do you know about Kaa'to Leeachos?\", \"What do you know about Speng?\", and \"Who is Coruum Sa'dia?\" Depending on their success rate, he will provide them with various bits of information needed to track down Leeachos.",
