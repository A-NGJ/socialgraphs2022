 "content": "The Zaprin family was a Human family that lived on the planet Naboo at the time of the Galactic Civil War. Larence Zaprin, his wife, his daughter Mia and his son Jowres lived in the Zaprin Estate in the remote mountain wilderness of Naboo.\nIn 1 ABY, the family's home was surrounded by sick animals and the siblings Mia und Jowres were attacked and infected with an illness. When Larence sent an urgent request for a doctor, a medic was sent to help the family. The medic was able to create an anti-toxin and cure the infected siblings.\nThe Zaprin family appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Zaprin family was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
