 "content": "Rohak was a male Human and a member of the group that founded the village of Aurilia on the planet of Dathomir. He would later become the village elder as well as its spiritual guide. By the time of the Galactic Civil War he was a very old and wise man for a Human and was once known to direct a Force-sensitive individual to other members of the village so that they could receive training in the ways of the Force. He was also known to hold at least one Force crystal.\nAfter the reformation of Aurilia into a township, Rohak remained in the town to provide guidance to the villagers and to travelers who found their way into the town. However, despite leading the village before, Paemos, not Rohak, was given the position as mayor of Aurilia.\nRohak appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
