 "content": "Tolok was a Human male Alderaanian aristocrat who escaped its destruction in 0 BBY. He was suspected by Leia Organa to be an Imperial spy, but this later turned out to be false. He was married to a fellow Alderaanian, Darlen, but they kept their marriage secret as they believed it was not right for them to share their happiness in front of the other refugees.",
