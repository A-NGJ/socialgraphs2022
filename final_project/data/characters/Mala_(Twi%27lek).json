 "content": "Mala was a female Twi'lek who lived in a remote, technologically primitive village on the planet Ryloth. Around eight years after the start of the Clone Wars, Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious, his Sith apprentice Darth Vader and Sergeant Erstin Deez of the Emperor's Royal Guard arrived in the village after having become stranded in the nearby wilderness during a visit to Ryloth. As the trio arrived, Mala was singing the Dirge of Valaunt in a haunting voice, and the child Drua pointed out the singer to the Imperials. The Twi'lek villagers then hosted the Imperials for a short period of time before members of the Free Ryloth Movement attacked the settlement in an attempt to try and kill Palpatine. In the chaos of the attack, the villagers fled and hid in a nearby cave as Imperial reinforcements joined the battle to aid the Emperor. After the Imperials emerged victorious, Sidious sent Vader to execute the villagers as he believed they had witnessed too much.\nMala first appeared in Lords of the Sith, a novel released in 2015 and written by Paul S. Kemp.",
