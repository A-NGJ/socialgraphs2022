 "content": "Preigo was a male Dug circus master who operated Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder during the Clone Wars. Leading a nomadic lifestyle with his performers, Preigo would visit various worlds and perform shows for those weary from the war. At some point, his circus made it to the planet Florrum, where they performed for a band of Weequay pirates. It wasn't the first time Preigo had performed for them, but was wary of the Weequay after they had decapitated one of his performers. After another show went awry for the circus performers, Preigo launched his ship off of Florrum to avoid the wrath of the pirates. A perfectionist, Preigo often began his shows by riding into an arena atop a trained narglatch.\nThe character was voiced by Stephen Stanton in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.",
