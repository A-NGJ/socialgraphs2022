 "content": "Brandeh was a female Lanteeban doctor who was a citizen of the mining town of Torbel on the planet Lanteeb during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the Battle of Lanteeb, she was slain by mosquito droids when the Separatist Droid Army invaded the town in search of Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.\nAround 21 BBY, Brandeh assisted Doctor Sufi when the planet was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems under the command of General Lok Durd, who was developing the newly-constructed bioweapon for the Separatist Alliance. Believing that Durd would promise to offer aid and supplies for the wounded, Brandeh and the villagers agreed to his statement. After some time, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, posing as farmers, arrived to warn the inhabitants about the Separatist's plot until one of the shields of the village threatened to fail, causing the refinery to collapse. When the residents were suffering, Brandeh and Greti assisted Obi-Wan and Skywalker in healing several of the villagers from the illness. As Durd learned that the two Jedi were hiding in Torbel, he sent an army of Battle droids to eliminate them. As the Separatists attacked the village, Brandeh was killed by a swarm of Mosquito droids during the fight.",
