Like all Cereans, this woman raised Mundi in a secluded lifestyle and gave her son to Jedi Master An'ya Kuro in 88 BBY when the latter discovered her son to have Force potential. She is the paternal grandmother to Ki-Adi-Mundi's children.\nShe died in 21 BBY during the Battle of Cerea with her daughter, granddaughters, husband, grandsons, and many other civilians.",
