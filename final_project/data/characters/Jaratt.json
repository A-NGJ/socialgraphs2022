 "content": "Jarrat was a male Human and an Imperial officer serving with Black Sword Command. He was captured by the Yevetha in 4 ABY.\nAfter more than a decade of captivity, however, Jarrat had become one of the leaders of Major Sil Sorannan's plot to liberate the remaining Imperial personnel in the Koornacht Cluster and return the Duskhan League's fleet of captured Star Destroyers to Imperial control. As such, Jarrat was responsible for initiating the slave circuitry that had been installed aboard the Valorous, and seizing control of the squadron for which it had served as a command ship.",
