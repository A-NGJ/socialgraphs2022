 "content": "Lieutenant Phison was a Human male Imperial crewmember of Burst Fire-class Deep-Space Patrol Vessel Concussor. During one of Concussor's patrols in 44 ABY, they picked up an escape pod that contained Bhindi Drayson and her unit of Wraith Squadron, who were on a mission to prove Galactic Alliance General Stavin Thaal of his guilt in the Lecersen Conspiracy. Phison was enamored by Drayson's \"air-headed heiress,\" which she used to get Lieutenant Phison to give her a tour of the Concussor so that Wraith Squadron could take over. When they succeeded in that operation, Phison and his crew were dropped to the nearest habitable planet with substantial provisions to live off of before they would eventually be picked up later on.",
