 "content": "Rystáll Sant was a female human-Theelin hybrid singer and dancer who worked for the Max Rebo Band. During the Galactic Civil War, she performed with the band in the palace of Jabba the Hutt.\nA hybrid between human and Theelin, Rystáll Sant was adopted by Ortolan musicians on Coruscant. She had an artistic personality, like many Theelin, and had a graceful dancer's body. She attracted attention from a variety of beings and was gifted a cape by a passing admirer, Syrh Rhoams. However, she was tricked into slavery by a lieutenant of the Black Sun criminal organization. Sant was later freed by Lando Calrissian, and her Ortolan parents arranged for her to perform as a singer and dancer with the Max Rebo Band.\nRystáll accompanied the band on more elaborate jobs. She had a long career that included singing in the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt during the Galactic Civil War. Shortly before members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic rescued the captive Han Solo from Jabba's Palace, Sant and her fellow bandmates performed \"Jedi Rocks\" for Jabba's court. Her performance attracted the attention and affection of famed bounty hunter Boba Fett.\nSant was a half-human, half-Theelin female with crimson hair, yellow eyes, and white skin with pink markings. She had several horns emerging from her head, and had hooved feet.\nA veteran performer, Sant was an accomplished singer and dancer who performed in numerous venues across the galaxy.\nRystáll Sant wore a chunky dark pink cape with a convor feather collar over a dark red dress while at the opera, gifted to her by Syrh Rhoams.\nRystáll Sant first appeared in the 1997 Special Edition re-release of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, in which she was added into the dance number in Jabba's Palace. She was portrayed by dancer Mercedes Ngoh.",
