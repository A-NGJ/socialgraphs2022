 "content": "Ewwen Glayyd was a Human male who served as the Mor, or clan patriarch, of the powerful House Glayyd on the Corporate Sector world of Ammuud. Glayyd ascended to the position of Mor in 2 BBY, when his father Agmor was mysteriously poisoned. The circumstances surrounding the former Mor's death became apparent weeks later, when Corellian smuggler Han Solo arrived on Ammuud investigating the Glayyds' links to a slaving ring that owed him money. Solo helped Glayyd out of a death duel with famed gunslinger Gallandro, then revealed that the slaver Zlarb was responsible for his father's death—in turn, Glayyd aided Solo in his hunt for the secretive group.\nThe scion of the ancient House Glayyd on the Corporate Sector planet Ammuud, Ewwen Glayyd grew up with great expectations on his shoulders. The Glayyd were one of the most powerful families on a planet historically racked by inter-clan warfare, and while the institution of the Code of Ammuud around 100 BBY had brought an uneasy peace to the world, the leader of House Glayyd was still expected to be a strong warrior. However, Ewwen Glayyd was a sickly youth, and many around him questioned that he had what it took to be the powerful Mor the Glayyds needed to maintain its position on Ammuud. By 2 BBY, the Glayyds were the strongest of the six founding clans of Ammuud, meaning that the other great families of the planet's society were always eager to see the Mor Glayyd meet with misfortune.\nThat was a fact Ewwen Glayyd learned quickly. That year, Ewwen Glayyd was raised to Mor—much sooner than expected—upon the sudden death of his father, Agmor, who was mysteriously poisoned by an unknown perpetrator. Less than a month after his father's death, the new Mor suddenly faced himself staring down his own. At a reception, a mysterious offworlder named Gallandro gravely insulted his sister Ido at a reception, striking her in the process. The Code of Ammuud compelled Glayyd to challenge the stranger to a death duel, not knowing that Gallandro just so happened to be one of the most renowned gunslingers in the galaxy. Honor dictated that if Glayyd pulled out of the fight, he would violate his oath as clan protector, and in doing so lose most of his popular support. Just minutes before the time of the duel, however, a solution arrived rather suddenly. Another offworlder, Corellian smuggler Han Solo, arrived claiming to have business with the Mor Glayyd—as Solo was a noted gunfighter himself, Ido begged him to intercede on her brother's behalf, which led to Gallandro pulling out of the duel and allowing Ewwen to save face.\nIn the aftermath of the duel, Solo informed Glayyd of his reasons for coming to Ammuud: he was after a slaving ring that had cheated him out of 10,000 credits, and through his investigation he had learned that one of the group's leaders, a man named Zlarb, had cleared several of his starships cleared through House Glayyd's shipping firm—the Glayyds had kept themselves purposefully unaware of the group's activities, as Zlarb and his associates paid them extremely well. Solo and his partner, Fiolla, hoped Glayyd could point them towards the ring's connections. Glayyd initially refused, as the provision of the Code of Ammuud known as the Silence compelled him not to betray their trust, as Zlarb's people had never broken faith with the Glayyds. However, Solo revealed that Zlarb was in fact a trained Malkite Poisoner, which piqued Glayyd's interest, as the identity of his father's poisoner was still unknown. Glayyd quickly became convinced that Zlarb had killed his father, which meant that the Silence no longer applied. The Mor promptly turned over a data plaque with all the information he had on Zlarb and his conspirators, information that implicated a number of higher-ups in the Corporate Sector Authority.\nIn the coming years, the young Mor of House Glayyd worked to make his vision of Ammuud's future a reality, reaching out to other clans in an effort to lead his homeworld away from its violent history. He also began making overtures to the New Republic, a fact that Han Solo, who later went on to become a General in the New Republic military, took as a personal compliment.\nAn idealistic young man, Ewwen Glayyd had big dreams for the future of House Glayyd and all of Ammuud. Not a natural warrior, Glayyd instead envisioned a future of peace and prosperity on Ammuud, where his homeworld could leave behind its war-torn past with the Glayyds at the helm. But while he harbored hopes for a new direction for Ammuud society, he still remained strongly committed to its tenets and traditions, believing that the Code of Ammuud was all that stood between his people and a sudden return to barbarism. That included dutifully challenging Gallandro to a death duel even though he was hopelessly outmatched, and adhering to the Silence although in doing so he protected slavers. However, he put the safety of his sister and his kinsmen above all else, and was not too proud to allow outside aid. He gladly helped Han Solo and Fiolla once it became clear the Code of Ammuud would not restrict him from doing so—although he was unable to wreak his own revenge on the people who killed his father, he took solace in the fact that he could at least witness theirs.\nEwwen Glayyd first appeared in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979. Glayyd was later pictured by Mike Vilardi in 1993's Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook, and by Brandon McKinney in 1998's The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons.",
