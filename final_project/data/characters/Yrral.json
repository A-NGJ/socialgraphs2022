 "content": "Yrral was a Cerean Dark Jedi, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nYrral was one of three Cerean triplets who joined the Jedi Order and became Padawans. However Yrral's siblings, Lyrrad and Lerred, and Yrral, all fell to the dark side of the Force and became Dark Jedi.\nThe three Cereans were present in the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius during the SoroSuub Anniversary celebration that was held there in 31 BBY. After the heroes of Cularin were attacked by a group of thugs during the event, word spread to the Cereans that a group of people were wandering the streets of Tolea Biqua in search of a fight. The three Cereans decided to oblige and, along with a group of thugs, they moved to attack the heroes. While the thugs opened fire on the heroes with their blasters, Lerred, Lyrrad and Yrral looked on from a balcony. The three Dark Jedi then jumped down, ignited their lightsabers and joined the fight.",
