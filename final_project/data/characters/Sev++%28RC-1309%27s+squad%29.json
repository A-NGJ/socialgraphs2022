 "content": "Sev was the nickname of a male Human clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He was created by the Kaminoan cloners on the planet Kamino for use in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. Trained as a clone commando, he was made a member of RC-1309's squad, serving alongside fellow commandos DD and RC-1304 \"O-Four\" under Sergeant Niner. The squad was deployed to the planet Geonosis during the first battle of the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the fight Sev, O-Four and DD were all killed, leaving Niner as the only member of his original squad. The sergeant later wished he had held Sev and DD back during the battle. Sev was able to tell what others around him were doing without looking, and like all clone troopers, he was 1.83 meters tall.\nSev was first mentioned in Republic Commando: Hard Contact a 2004 novel written by Karen Traviss. He later received mention in Republic Commando: Triple Zero and Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, other books in the same series.",
