 "content": "Samara Mindak was a Human female and social high-flier within the upper class scene on Dromund Kaas. Mindak harbored a disdain for her father, Theovor Mindak, and was nonchalant when approached by Cipher Nine, an agent of Imperial Intelligence demanding information on his location and state of alliance with the rebel Sith Lord Grathan, providing information on his whereabouts and access codes to his lab.\nAlthough her father thought she was \"useless\", she possessed a keen social intelligence and was able to detect the sincerity of others, although was cold and often abrasive if people didn't interest her.\nSamara Mindak appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare and LucasArts on December 20, 2011. She appears in the Imperial Agent mission \"High Society\" on Dromund Kaas, where the player seeks her out in order to locate her father. Mindak can be threatened into cooperating, bribed with her father's inventions and fortune, or seduced by a male Agent of Humans, cyborgs, and Sith Purebloods background. She can also be killed by the Agent when she is no longer useful.",
