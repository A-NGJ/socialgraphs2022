 "content": "Seamus Kaldo was a Human male who lived during the Galactic War. His father's life's work, engine schematics, were once stolen from his family by Nico Okarr, leading Seamus to attempt to track down the infamous smuggler and seek revenge. While this was not initially successful, he eventually came upon his quarry by accident; unknowingly hiring him in the Sarlacc and Loaded cantina on Molavar while Nico was under the alias of \"Snare\". After trying to persuade \"Snare\" to help him on his quest, \"Snare\" revealed that he was in fact Nico Okarr. When Seamus and his bodyguard, Vhonu, attempted to apprehend the newly revealed smuggler, Nico shot them both with his blaster on stun.",
