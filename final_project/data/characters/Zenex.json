 "content": "Zenex was a male Falleen who worked as a crime lord on The Wheel space station, and was secretly in league with the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.\nWhen Khaleen Hentz stole a data chip containing the CIS plans to attack Kamino from him, he ordered the Quarren mercenary Grakko to find and kill her. Grakko was unsuccessful, and the remains of his body were later found by Zenex and his men. In order to ensure that the Galactic Republic would be able to successfully defend Kamino, Quinlan Vos set up a meeting between Zenex and Khaleen, where Khaleen would give Zenex back the data chip, under the watchful eye of Jedi Knights Vos and Aayla Secura. The plan appeared to be going well, until Zenex killed his own henchmen with a blaster and tried to use his species' powerful pheromones to make Khaleen kill herself. Quinlan Vos saved her, but almost died when Zenex attempted to push him off the bridge they were standing on. Aayla Secura saved the data chip, but before she could do anything else, Zenex began using his pheromones on her. Aayla, with the help of the Force, was able to resist, and killed Zenex with her lightsaber.",
