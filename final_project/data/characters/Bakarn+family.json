 "content": "The Bakarn family, formerly the Bakvalen family, was a noble family on the planet Corellia that made its home in Bakvalen Hall on Axial Park. Several generations before the Great Galactic War, the family's eldest daughter Jhaka became a Republic fighter pilot and took on the surname Bakarn when her father disowned her. After Jhaka died leading her squadron to victory against a warlord in the Outer Rim Territories, her father changed the family name to Bakarn to honor her. The Jedi Master and Child of the Sith Emperor Syo Bakarn was a descendant of the house.",
