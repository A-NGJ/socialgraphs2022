 "content": "Sizinnian was a male Snivvian, who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSizinnian was a scholar and researcher who began producing an analysis of Journey of the Minds, a 102-volume ancient Snivvian philosophical text. However, the intensity of his research led many of his acquaintances to question his sanity, so Sizinnian traveled the Southcentral Branch of the Eyar City Sewer, to study alone. Sizinnian learned how to fool maintenance sensors and bribed the sewers' maintenance workers to leave him alone, while he lived in a pair of unused chambers within the sewer.\nSizninnian was extremely paranoid and whenever he met anyone; he worried that they might steal his research.",
