 "content": "A Chistori male thug who lived on Cato Neimoidia during the early days of the recently formed Galactic Empire heard about a job offered by Ember Chankeli on a bar to which he wanted to sign on. He had a confrontation with Dass Jennir, another candidate, over the job. Jennir was easily able to defeat the thug and do a mind trick on him shortly after. Not admitting defeat the thug later found Jennir discussing the job with Ember and another candidate, this time he brought enough of his friend to take Jennir down, this proved wrong when Jennir was able to yet again beat the thug and his allies, taking the job shortly after.\nThe Chistori thug appeared in 2009 in Dark Times: Blue Harvest, Part 2 the second of two mini-issues of the Star Wars: Dark Times comic book series which was designed as an introduction to the Blue Harvest story arc. The issue was written by Randy Stradley under the name Mike Harrison and illustrated by Douglas Wheatley.",
