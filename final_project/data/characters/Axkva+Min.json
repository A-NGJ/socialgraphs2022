 "content": "Axkva Min was a Nightsister who was situated in the Nightsister Stronghold on the planet Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War, and used a specialized energy lance as her main weapon.\nShe was imprisoned in the Chamber of Banishment near the Stronghold because of her practice of draining the life from her pupils in order to increase her own power. She possessed a fragment of the Codex of Tython, an ancient Jedi Holocron. An Alliance to Restore the Republic agent seeking to reassemble the holocron came looking for Min, using the Key of Exile provided by Sarguillo, to access the Chamber. There, he found several Nightsisters guarding a large crystal which contained the essence of Axkva Min trapped within. The Codex, possessed by the Rebel, then launched a bolt of energy to the crystal, destroying it and freeing Axkva Min. She attacked the intruder, but was defeated and offered him to take her life, seeing it as a preferable fate to eternal imprisonment. The Rebel, however, was only looking for a crystal on a chain around the witch's neck. When this fragment installed back into the Code, another arc of energy jumped from the Codex to the banishment crystal. The figure of Axkva Min was transported inside again, and the scattered pieces of the crystal reformed themselves with her essence inside. Once again, the Queen of the Nightsisters was trapped within.\nLater she was killed by a group of spacers as she attempted to escape.\nA portrait of the former Nightsister Queen managed to survive her death.\nAxkva Min was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Axkva Min was added to the game with the \"Publish 5\" update, released on December 16, 2003. Upon the release of the \"Chapter 7\" on November 1, 2007, she was made the main boss of the eponymous \"Heroic Encounter.\"",
