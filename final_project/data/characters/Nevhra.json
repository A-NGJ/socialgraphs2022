 "content": "Nevhra was a friend of Bant'ena Fhernan during the Clone Wars. Around 21 BBY, Fhernan was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Separatists subsequently forced her to work for them by claiming that they would kill Fherman's friends and family, including Nevhra, if she refused to co-operate with them. The Separatists subsequently placed Nevhra under surveillance and Fhernan later showed a hologram of Nevhra to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. When the Republic as able to find the location of the hostages, Nevhra was brought to safety.",
