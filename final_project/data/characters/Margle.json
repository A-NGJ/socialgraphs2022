 "content": "Margle was a male Gran Special Forces soldier who served in the New Republic and participated in the Battle of Jakku.\nMargle was a male Gran who was part of a team of New Republic Special Forces team that was led by Dellalo Dayson. When the New Republic embarked on the Battle of Jakku, Dayson and her team loaded munitions onto their UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft. Margle and the team were joined by former commando and disgraced SpecForces fighter Jom Barell, who Dayson allowed to stow aboard their ship.\nDuring the battle, Dayson's U-wing dropped into Jakku's atmosphere, where it was targeted by a missile. Jom leaped from the transport and used his jetpack to intercept the projectile, killing himself but saving Margle and the rest of the crew.",
