 "content": "Relus Poh was an immigrant to Taris during the Cold War. Along with his sister, Jaymizu Poh, Relus attempted to reclaim his ancestors' estate on Taris, unaware that a group of aliens was living in the house.\nRelus Poh was created for the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. If the player is with the Republic faction, he or she can choose whether to help the Pohs take back their ancestors' home as a dark side option, or tell them that the aliens' deed is a better claim to the property than their ancestors' as a light side option.",
