 "content": "Riv Shiel was a male Shistavanen pilot who joined Rogue Squadron after the Battle of Endor.\nDuring Riv Shiel's early career as a spacer, he was mistaken by Imperial stormtroopers for the wanted Shistavanen rebel, Lak Sivrak. The soldiers attacked Shiel, who killed them. His act of self-defense earned Shiel a death mark that he would carry for the rest of his life.\nWhen Wedge Antilles reformed Rogue Squadron in 6 ABY, Shiel applied for membership in the elite unit. His simulator scores were good enough to earn him a place on the roster and he was paired with Gavin Darklighter.\nShiel was instrumental in the Rogues' fight against the former head of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard, who had taken the leadership of the Galactic Empire. He participated in the commando operation that resulted in the capture of Coruscant, and he resigned his commission, along with the rest of his squadron, to assist the Ashern Rebels in the fight against Isard on Thyferra.\nShiel was killed during a raid on three bacta tankers when the Victory II-class Star Destroyer Corrupter, commanded by Captain Ait Convarion, ambushed the squadron. Convarion opened fire three seconds after reversion to real space, destroying the tanker that Gavin Darklighter, Shiel and two Twi'lek Death Seed pilots were escorting, killing Riv and the Twi'leks and damaging Gavin's X-wing.",
