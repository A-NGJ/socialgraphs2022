 "content": "Tana was the proprietor of Tana's Resort on the planet of Rion. An acquaintance of Han Solo, Tana opened her resort as a refuge for the people of Rion when the world was devastated by the Imperial-commandeered Ionic Ring Ship, which rendered Rion a frozen wasteland. Solo, who was chasing the Ionic Ring, arrived shortly after and sought Tana out. Solo promised to use his connections with the Rebel Alliance to provide Rion with food, and gave Tana and her people a shipment of spice to help them in the interim. In exchange, Tana provided the Ionic Ring's next target: Little Kessel, allowing Solo and his friends Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca to thwart the Empire's plans.\nTana appeared in The Second Kessel Run, a comic strip story arc written by Russ Helm and released in 1980. In the comic, Tana was illustrated by Russ Manning.",
