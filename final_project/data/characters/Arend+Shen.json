 "content": "Arend Shen was a male Pantoran who lived on Cloud City during the Galactic Civil War. During the war, he hired a group of spacers to steal the Jewel of Yavin, a Corusca gem owned by Marus Grayson, an Imperial whom he had a grudge against. He sent his daughter Aris Shen to coordinate the group, and informed the thieves they would steal the gem twice. They would first drive up prices at an auction for the gem, the payment for which they would steal, and then steal the gem itself. Once the thieves succeeded however, Shen double-crossed them and attempted to kill them, although he was unsuccessful. Shen owned a Courier-class yacht named the Venture.",
