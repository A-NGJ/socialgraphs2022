 "content": "Igpek Droon was a male Human small time trader raised by Agro-Militants.\nDroon had a strong dislike of droids or other sentient beings which acted as subordinates when they worked for him. Due to this, he later spent a fortune having the programming of his droids changed so they would call him friend or comrade.\nC-3PO would later use Droon's name as an alias so he and R2-D2 could escape off of Nim Drovis.",
