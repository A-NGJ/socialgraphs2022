 "content": "Boss Banjeer was a Human male who served as the Governor of Baramorra during the Galactic Civil War.\nHis uncle was Admiral Llon Banjeer, and when the latter was placed on the Imperial Ruling Council in 11 ABY, he placed his nephew in control of Baramorra and all bounty hunters in its sector. When the elders of Baramorra objected, the Boss had them all executed. He also engaged in business with Grappa the Hutt. In 11 ABY, Kir Kanos under the guise of Kenix Kil came to Baramorra, answering Banjeer's call for bounty hunters. Assuring the governor knew where Kanos was, Kil led his bounty hunters into the planet's forests, killing them before returning to complete the job with Banjeer.",
