 "content": "Taanti was a Weequay male proprietor that worked as a bartender at a cantina in Freetown. After the Battle of Endor, the Mining Collective attacked the cantina, killing the townsfolk inside. Taanti escaped with the help of Cobb Vanth, who later liberated the town. Years later, he served spotchka to Vanth, the marshal of the town, and to the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, who had come searching for Vanth. Taanti, along with the people of Mos Pelgo, joined Vanth, Djarin and a local group of Tusken Raiders to kill a krayt dragon that attacked the town.\nSometime later, he served a drink to Vanth, while Djarin asked the marshal to lead a garrison in assistance of Boba Fett against the Pyke Syndicate. Taanti interfered, saying that the town wanted no part of it, and that it was a city folk fight. Shortly after, Vanth asked Taanti to gather men and women of fighting age to meet. Taanti replied that the conflict with the Pykes was not the town's problem. Before they could arrange the meeting, Vanth was shot down by Cad Bane, which convinced Taanti and the town's garrison to join the battle. Freetown's help saved Fett's forces, and eventually they won the battle, driving out the Syndicate out of the planet.\nTaanti, like his fellow inhabitants of Mos Pelgo, regarded Tuskens as brutal enemies. When Djarin proposed an alliance between the townsfolk and the Tuskens, Taanti shouted that they were monsters, although eventually they killed the dragon together.\nTaanti thought that the \"city folk fight\" on Mos Espa was not the town's problem, but later joined the fight, in revenge of Vanth, who was shot by Cad Bane.\nTaanti first appeared in Chapter 9 of The Mandalorian and was portrayed by W. Earl Brown.",
