 "content": "A male from the planet Polyneus was the former caretaker of Conna Dew. According to her, some time after the Battle of Jakku but before 11 ABY, this male had decided to become a Sun-Lama at the age of ninety-nine. Dew also expressed her annoyance at the fact that he insisted on sharing many details of the secret teachings of the Sun-Lamas with her.\nConna Dew's caretaker was mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed.",
