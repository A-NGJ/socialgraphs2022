 "content": "Tal was a male Human nurse who was working at a medical facility on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant shortly after the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY. The Twi'lek Eleena Daru, Sith Lord Darth Malgus's lover, was a patient at the medical facility at one point while Tal was on duty. When Malgus went to the facility to pick up Daru, Tal tried to stop him. A female nurse warned Tal that Malgus was a Sith, so he relented and let Malgus leave with Daru.\nTal appeared in the novel The Old Republic: Deceived, written by Paul S. Kemp and first published on March 22, 2011.",
