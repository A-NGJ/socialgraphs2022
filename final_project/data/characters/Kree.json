He served under the lieutenant Felix Iresso on Hoth but the difficult situation here and the enemy attacks pushed Kree and his compatriots to the verge of the munity; only the timely arrive of the Barsen'thor convinced most of the soldiers to come back to the line. Kree however tried to rebel but was quickly subdued and the Jedi convinced Iresso to pardon the private. However, during the mission, he first staged a mutiny against Iresso and then deserted to the pirates of the White Maw. He died fighting Iresso and the Third Barsen'thor.",
