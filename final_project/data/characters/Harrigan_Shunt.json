 "content": "Harrigan Shunt was a male Human who served as Head Engineer of the Separatist army's heavy artillery division. During the Clone Wars, Shunt was arrested by Jedi Master Mace Windu and then imprisoned within The Prism throughout the rest of the war. After the rise of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Gentis coup, Shunt was released and became part of a brutal test created by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, to see who among the prisoners was worthy of joining the New Order. Shunt was among a number of failed prisoners that were killed in the brutal battle.",
