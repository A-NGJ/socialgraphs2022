 "content": "Lliandri was a female green-skinned Twi'lek who worked as a bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War.\nLliandri was sold into slavery at an early age, but she escaped her owner and managed to eke out a living on Ord Mantell. Later, she accidentally killed a criminal on Ord Mantell in self-defense, and despite her sadness at the death, she relished the reward she got from the local authorities. It was then that she chose to become a bounty hunter.\nLliandri was tall with dark eyes. She favored using dual heavy blaster pistols and kept her head-tails constantly in motion in order to distract her prey.\nAs a hunter, Lliandri refused to take Imperial contracts because the Empire allowed slavery. She was also an associate of the bounty hunter Tern Ashandrik.",
