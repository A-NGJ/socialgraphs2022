 "content": "\"Aven\" was a Human male, and a clone of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Born on the planet of Kamino, Aven was one of one hundred Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos that made up part of the Grand Army of the Republic's special forces. When the Clone Wars broke out across the galaxy between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Aven would serve the Republic as a lieutenant in the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade. During the Battle of Coruscant in 19 BBY, Aven led Republic commando squads Omega and Yayax in defense of the headquarters of HoloNet News and Entertainment so that the HoloNet station would be able to continue transmitting to the citizens of Coruscant and the Republic.\nAven was a male Human, and a clone of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Grown in secret on the planet Kamino, Aven was one of the Grand Army of the Republic's one hundred elite Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos. Like all of the Alpha-class ARC troopers, Aven was trained on Kamino by Jango Fett himself. However, the Kaminoans felt that the ARC trooper's fierce independence made them unpredictable and had them put into stasis until the Battle of Kamino in the first year of the Clone Wars; with the planet under attack by the battle droids of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Master Shaak Ti had the ARC troopers taken out of stasis to assist in the battle. Once the battle was over and the Republic victorious, Aven and the other ARC troopers would enter Republic service as part of the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade.\nBy 19 BBY, the third and final year of the Clone Wars, Aven held the rank of lieutenant in the Grand Army. When the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous, attacked the Republic capital world of Coruscant, Aven was on the surface to aid in the planet's defense. He led the Republic commandos of both Omega and Yayax squads in protecting the headquarters of HoloNet News and Entertainment, ensuring that the HoloNet station would continue to broadcast to the citizens of Coruscant. Once the employees of HNE had assembled a mobile transmitter, both the transmitter and close to a dozen HNE staff members were loaded into a LAAT/i gunship and moved to a more secure location. Aven and the commandos then moved into the foyer of HNE headquarters, where they would hold the building throughout the nearly week-long battle.\nAven possessed a cynic's sharp humor, often quiet but cutting at times. He was critical of Republic Defense Procurement and what Aven viewed as their underwhelming track record, but also sympathetic to the needs of his fellow clone soldiers. In battle, Aven was not afraid of confronting a Separatist super battle droid at close quarters, and his position as an ARC lieutenant afforded him the ability to call in air support from nearby gunships.\nAs an Alpha-class ARC trooper, Aven wore the hardier ARC trooper armor rather than the more common Phase II armor worn by standard clone troopers. During the Battle of Coruscant, Aven also made use of twin DC-17 blaster pistols to combat the Separatist battle droids.\nThe ARC trooper nicknamed Aven first appeared in the fourth installment of the Republic Commando series entitled Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, by author Karen Traviss.",
