 "content": "Metron Besk was the founder of Dynamic Automata, a droid-manufacturing company. Besk built the company from a single firm that supplied logic-enhancement circuits to third-degree droids. Eventually, he began supplying the Empire with advanced droid circuitry aboard Sector Plexus droid vessels and Viper probe droids.\nBesk was a suspicious man and grew tired of the backstabbing and bickering among his company's partners. Before his death, Besk carefully divided the company's power among them so that they would all have to answer to his daughter, Elta Besk. Besk trained his daughter in corporate and armed warfare and handed control of Dynamic Automata over to her.",
