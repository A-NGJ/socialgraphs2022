 "content": "Boneshatter, who bore the epithet the Rampager, was a wraid owned by the Hutt crime lord Suudaa Nem'ro who kept it in the beast pit of his palace on the planet Nal Hutta. In 3643 BBY, Nem'ro sent a bounty hunter who was seeking the Hutt's sponsorship for the Great Hunt competition to kill the beast master that cared for Boneshatter, claiming that he was a traitor.\nNem'ro warned the beast master that the hunter was coming, so the beast master prepared Boneshatter and several other creatures to attack the hunter. Once the hunter arrived, the beast master began releasing the creatues while Nem'ro watched. After the hunter slew the k'lor'slug Clawbane, the beast master released Boneshatter and two Akk pups, but the hunter managed to slay them all, and ultimately the beast master himself. Nem'ro congratulated the hunter on killing Boneshatter and the other beasts. The wraid had yellow skin and white eyes.\nBoneshatter appeared as a non-optional enemy in \"House Cleaning,\" a quest in the bounty hunter class campaign in the 2011 massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
