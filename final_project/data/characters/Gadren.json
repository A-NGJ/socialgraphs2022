 "content": "Gadren was a male Besalisk from Corellia. After his family was sold into slavery by the Galactic Empire, he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic; serving in its 61st Mobile Infantry, better known as Twilight Company.\nShortly after joining the Company, Gadren was present for its devastating campaign on Ferrok Pax. He was a warrior poet, often singing in the trenches to boost morale.\nGadren recruited Hazram Namir to the Alliance during open recruitment on the planet Crucival. Gadren saw Namir rise up the ranks and later served under First Sergeant Namir through many battles of the Galactic Civil War. He fought in battles such as that on Haidoral Prime and Inyusu Tor, where he lost one of his four arms.\nGadren first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed.",
