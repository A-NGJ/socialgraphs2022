 "content": "Jeelg was a Human male officer who served the reconstituted Sith Empire as a captain on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas.\nAt some point prior to or during the Cold War, Jeelg was promoted to the rank of captain in the Sith military at which point several men serving under him planned him a surprise party to celebrate. Being an extremely paranoid individual, he believed they were instead secretly planning a mutiny and attacked the men. This led to his posting in a camp outside Kaas City where he soon became paranoid that he was being spied upon by Kubaz spies. His fears were confirmed when he hired a spacer to collect a holocommunicator from one of the Kubaz as proof they were present, which the spacer successfully did.",
