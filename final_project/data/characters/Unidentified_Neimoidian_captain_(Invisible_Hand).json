 "content": "A Neimoidian male served as the captain of the Providence-class Dreadnought Invisible Hand during the Battle of Coruscant. The captain and other members of the bridge crew originally served the Trade Federation when the dreadnought was owned by Viceroy Nute Gunray. After General Grievous demanded command of the Invisible Hand, the bridge crew, including the captain, were allowed to stay, though they were now assisted by droids. Under Grievous's command, the Invisible Hand served as the flagship of the Confederacy navy and fought in many battles during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Battle of Coruscant, Grievous boarded the bridge and requested a situation update from the captain, which the neimodian provided. The Neimoidian later gave orders to the bridge crew during and after the dreadnought's confrontation with the Guarlara. The battle ultimately proved to be a Separatist loss, with many members of the bridge crew trying to flee the Invisible Hand when the starship was crippled, including the Neimodian, however, Grievous deployed all Escape pods, preventing any escape. The Invisible Hand was ultimately driven to Coruscant by Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had boarded the ship.\nThe Neimoidian captain first appeared as an unnamed character in the opening scenes of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Within the Star Wars Legends continuity the character was identified in the StarWars.com Databank as \"Lushros Dofine.\"",
