 "content": "Dr. Vacca was a doctor who helped to develop the Dead Eye Prototype. During its production, he was in a dilemma concerning whether he should give the formula to the Rebellion or to the Empire, the latter of which killed his family in the Destruction of Alderaan.\nDr. Vacca was mentioned in SWG, and also appeared on the Cries of Alderaan badge icons. However, he never actually appeared in the game as a non-player character, despite being referenced in the Prima Official Game Guide as such.",
