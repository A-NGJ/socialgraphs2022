Portly yet agile, Vindako dressed in a thick leather coat adorned with animal teeth. During her career, she worked with her employee, Orl Miscord, to capture a dust-stalker in the Madlands. When rumor got out that Vindako was in possession of the legendary Grimoire of Syclos the Lame, Miscord released the dust-stalker in hopes that it would kill Vindako so that he might take possession of the ancient book.",
