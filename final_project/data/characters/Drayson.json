 "content": "Drayson was a female Nautolan who served as a commander in the Republic Military during the Galactic War with the Sith Empire. She was one of the commanders during the Korriban Incursion, and was slain by Imperial forces.\nCommander Drayson appears as one of the four Republic commanders that must be killed in the Imperial version of the Tactical Flashpoint \"Korriban Incursion,\" which was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel in Game Update 2.7: Invasion. For Republic players, Drayson is replaced by Commander Keikodi, and the two share many of their game mechanics.",
