 "content": "Karka Vriskar was a Bothan explorer and a member of Clan Askar. In the year 200 BBY, Vriskar was the first off-worlder to discover the planet Dressel, home of the sentient Dressellian species. Following the initial discovery, the Bothans maintained frequent diplomatic contact with the Dressellians but otherwise did not interfere with their primitive society.\nKarka Vri'skar was first mentioned in Stay on Target, a supplement released in 2015 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game.",
