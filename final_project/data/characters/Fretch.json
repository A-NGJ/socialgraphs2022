 "content": "Fretch was a short-snouted male Rodian student at the Orsis Academy who often expressed disdain towards a young Maul, thinking him a tattletale and dangerous individual in the academy. After making fun of Maul's \"friend\" Kilindi Matako for once being a slave, Maul brutally broke Fretch's fingers, after tricking him into participating in a handshake. Skilled in tracking and sharp-shooting, he teamed up with Meltch Krakko and fellow Rodian Hubnutz in a combat mission against Maul in the Vale of Pale Tears in 39 BBY. Sporting a mimetic suit, respirator mask and a blaster, Fetch and the other two were defeated after Maul had used the Force to gain the upper hand. When Maul was ordered to kill everyone at the Orsis Academy by Darth Sidious, he personally woke Fretch up before he killed him.",
