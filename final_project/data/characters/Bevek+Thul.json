 "content": "Bevek Thul was a Human male member of House Thul who served as Commander of House Thul's naval force during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Bevek was planning an operation against House Organa at the Outpost Eudor in the Kaamos Territory. However, his movements quickly became known to the enemy and he suspected that spies from House Organa were hiding in the nearby hills. Bevek Thul tasked an Imperial hero to kill these spies and retrieve any recordings they made. After the mission was completed, he suggested that he could name a future battleship in the Hero's name.",
