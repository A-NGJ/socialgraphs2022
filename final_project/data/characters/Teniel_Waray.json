 "content": "Teniel Waray was a Human female Corellian Security Force agent who lived on the planet Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Chirq Council following the increase of ryll traffic on Corellia. In 1 ABY, Captain Vitala Baize successfully infiltrated a CorSec agent in Jzoro Quanera's Chirq Council cell in Doaba Guerfel and managed to obtain the identity of the nine Chirq Council elite councilors and the locations of their two secret headquarters. The Corsec thus assaulted the First and Second Elite Council Bunkers near Doaba Guerfel. Agent Teniel Waray was assigned to the attack on the First Elite Council Bunker. Agent Solso was tasked to hinder the Chirq Council's research into biological weapons. Waray thus hired an independent spacer who previously worked for the CorSec to help her in her mission. The spacer entered the First Elite Council Bunker and managed to destroy all the Chirq Council bioweapons and collect data about the weapons developed there. Eventually, the Chirq Council splintered after the Chirq Council elite councilors were killed by the CorSec in the Elite Council Bunkers.\nTeniel Waray was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Teniel Waray was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
