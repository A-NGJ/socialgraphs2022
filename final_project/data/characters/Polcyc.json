 "content": "Polcyc was an Abyssin scavenger who was a member of the Wreckers, a loose affiliation of scavengers operating on the ice world Hoth. During the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, Polcyc and fellow scavenger Iavyn Ajik acted as army leaders among the Wreckers under the leadership of the Ugnaught Ozgurk, who had assumed the name of the Wreckers' former leader, Bohento Splinth.\nUnder Ozgurk, the Wreckers amassed in preparation to attack a series of camps set up by an anti-Imperial alliance seeking to salvage starship weaponry from Hoth. In order to cause chaos among the Wreckers, a young smuggler from the alliance fought through various scavengers to reach Polcyc and Ajik, who attacked the smuggler on sight. The pair were slain in the battle, which caused chaos among the scavengers as planned and brought the alliance some breathing room. Polcyc had white hair, a black eye, and green skin. The Abyssin wore white and gray armor and fought with a sword.\nPolcyc appeared as a boss in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the name Polcyc was given as an example of an Abyssin name in Ultimate Alien Anthology, a 2003 supplement for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game produced by Wizards of the Coast.",
