 "content": "Bab Esrus was a Human female who stayed in the city of Moenia on the Mid Rim world of Naboo during the Galactic Civil War.\nBab Esrus was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who spoke to Esrus in Moenia were able to complete three quests for her, the first of which was a delivery quest, the second an escort quest, and the third another delivery quest. However, the dialogue for Esrus was incomplete, which made it impossible to derive any context for the quest's storyline. She was eventually removed from the game by the developers.",
