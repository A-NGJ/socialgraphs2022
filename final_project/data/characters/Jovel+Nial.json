 "content": "Jovel Nial was a young female of the Bothan species who served as an aide to Senator Trellev Aquem during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. She was a scion of the Clan Nial, an expansive family of Bothan politicians with roots set down all over Coruscant, the capital of the government, and beyond. It was Jovel Nial's family who had arranged for her to work with Aquem. When the senator discovered her slicing talents, he chose to keep it a secret so he could make use of it. While working for Aquem, Nial also served the interests of the Pyke Syndicate, which pulled the strings of the politician.",
