 "content": "Gibberous Crumb was a male Kowakian monkey-lizard who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was raised by a Hutt, but was eventually abandoned by his master and entered the care of the crime lord Nirama. During the time of the Clone Wars, Crumb was present aboard a sail barge on the planet Genarius, when Nirama met with some freelance agents there.\nGibberous Crumb was a Kowakian monkey-lizard born during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was the cousin of Salacious B. Crumb, a monkey-lizard who would later become the jester of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Gibberous was raised by a Hutt, but was abandoned by his master and entered the care of the Oblee crime lord Nirama, whose Organization controlled crime in the Cularin system. Nirama disliked Crumb, as he considered the monkey-lizard to be an annoyance.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Crumb was present on the planet Genarius, when Nirama met with a group of freelance agents whom the Oblee wanted to investigate a research facility in the floating city Ipsus. The meeting took place in the city of Tolea Biqua, aboard Riboga's Barge, a sail barge that was used as a casino. During the meeting, Crumb stayed in the back room of the barge and climbed onto the side of a fish tank. He gazed at the amphibious creatures inside the tank and cackled every few minutes.\nCrumb had gangly arms and legs and a tuft of orange-colored hair on the top of his head. He was less intelligent than his cousin Salacious and was also loud and obnoxious. He was not a good fighter and was loyal to no one. Crumb also liked to eat rotting meat.\nGibberous Crumb was created by Morrie Mullins and made his only appearance in Star Wars canon in Open Aarms, a scenario in the Living Force campaign, a supplement to the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In the supplement, the players role-play as the Heroes of Cularin, and it is possible for them to ask Nirama about Crumb. If any of the player characters take time to be nice to Crumb, Nirama gives Crumb to the player as a gift. If a player receives Crumb, every time they play with other people in a Living Force event, every participating player in the group must make a charisma check, a means of gaining scores for the strengths of personality of all player characters. Crumb then falls in love with the player who has the highest score, and that person becomes his new owner. If another player in the group owns a Kowakian monkey-lizard, then at the start of an event, Crumb and the other monkey-lizard rush off to have fun together. At the end of the event, Crumb's owner would then roll a die to determine whether or not Crumb returns.\nOpen Aarms does not state the identity of the Hutt who raised Crumb, but it was likely to have been Riboga, a Hutt who controlled crime in the Cularin system and left after losing control of his operation to Nirama, leaving behind many of his former associates.",
