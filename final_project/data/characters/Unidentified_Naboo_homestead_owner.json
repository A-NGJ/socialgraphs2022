 "content": "A Human male owned a homestead on the planet Naboo's countryside at the time of the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Early during the invasion, the Trade Federation launched an attack on Naboo civilians to quell any potential uprisings. The Human's homestead was in the way of the advancing battle droids. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes, an officer of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, was in the area at the same time.\nLieutenant Sykes used his Flash speeder to destroy the first wave of droids, after which the man ran out from his house to his landspeeder. A second wave of droids pursued the man's speeder, but Sykes drove them off. In gratitude, the individual asked the pilot to follow him. Leading Sykes to his nearby farm, the homestead owner gave the pilot technology useful to the Naboo Resistance. The homestead owner subsequently hid in his armored barn.\nThe light-skinned owner was wearing a blue tunic with black boots during the encounter.\nThe homestead owner appears in a side-quest in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo. Saving him from attacking droids allows the player to find a vehicle upgrade and fulfill a bonus objective by picking up the upgrade. He uses the same sprite as the other Human characters in the game.",
