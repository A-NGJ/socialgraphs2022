 "content": "A male Human local official on the planet Sacorria was the father of Devidia Vennsiol. When Devidia was a child, he allowed her to do as she pleased with little consequence, spoiling and pampering her. She quickly learned to control boys with her looks and charisma, which drove her father to his wit's end, and resulted in him sending her to military school as a teenager. Devidia learned little at the school though, and her attitude did not improve. She eventually broke into a Safidine Industries laboratory with her boyfriend Dorbus Kyrullus and they stole several prototype blaster pistols, resulting in a bounty being placed on her head.\nThe official was first mentioned in the \"Bounties to Die For\" article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series. The magazines were supplements for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game and the official was included in an entry for Devidia Vennsiol, which was written by S. Mitch Ritchie.",
