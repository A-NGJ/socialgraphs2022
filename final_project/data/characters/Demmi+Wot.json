 "content": "Demmi Wot was a Human male who lived in Coronet City on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nDemmi Wot used to be a member of the Ragtags, a group of low-life thugs. However, he finally left the gang because he did not tolerate vandalism and violence. At some point, he worked with the Corellia Times journalist Finn Shallo and provided him information about the Corellian criminal groups. In 1 ABY, Demmi Wot and Finn Shallo accepted to help a spacer working for CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper. Thanks to Wot, the spacer was able to discover that the Ragtags were responsible for vandalism in the Coronet Starport.\nDemmi Wot was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nDemmi Wot was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. He was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
