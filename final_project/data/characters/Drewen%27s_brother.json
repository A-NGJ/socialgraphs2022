 "content": "A Segredo male was the brother of Drewen. When marauders attacked their village, Drewen and his brother were among those strong enough to work who captured and taken aboard the raiders' starship. During their time aboard the ship, Drewen's brother would tell him stories about the Jedi. When the Great Hyperspace Disaster caused starships to be thrown out of hyperspace, those captured aboard the vessel were able to fight back. Drewen's brother got him into an escape pod, saving his life, but did not make it out alive himself.",
