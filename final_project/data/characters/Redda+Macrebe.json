 "content": "Redda Macrebe was a male Human who served as a Rebel Alliance agent tasked with acquiring supplies. He was the center of a network of agents and had a vast network of contacts. He primarily operated within the Trax Tube space lane systems.\nMacrebe was very efficient at his job. When faced with a request that might normally be unattainable, Macrebe could improvise by acquiring various parts that could be used to construct the needed equipment. During a mission in the Trax sector, he supplied Airen Cracken with all the necessary equipment to complete the mission.",
