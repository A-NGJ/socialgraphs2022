In 1 BBY, she was one of the twenty-six Rebel resistance soldiers that were led by Morgan Katarn and participated in the missile team during Jerec's attack.\nHidden behind some boulders at the G-Tap cave, she was replacing her companion Trol's tube with SLM, until one bound was hit by a laser beam, and were both killed.",
