 "content": "Vaadu was a Phindian male senator who represented Phindar in the Galactic Republic during the High Republic Era. Aboard her flagship, Coruscant Dawn, on her way to the Republic Fair on Valo, Chancellor Lina Soh was in session with the Senate, speaking with a number of senators that included Vaadu. During the conversation, Vaadu raised concerns about the security detail present at the fair, afraid of interference by the Nihil marauders. Vaadu was concerned about the attendance of Senator Tia Toon, who Vaadu believed would use any incident that may occur, regardless of scale, as a reason to push his previously-rejected Defense Force Program.",
