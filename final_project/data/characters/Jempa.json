 "content": "Jempa was a Whiphid member of Bear Clan, a group of younglings within the Jedi Order. In 22 BBY, Jempa and the rest of the clan were given a lesson on lightsaber use by Grand Master Yoda in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi interrupted the lesson to ask Yoda about a planet he could not find in the Jedi Archives and was greeted by Jempa and the other younglings.\nJempa was a Force-sensitive Whiphid born at some point between 30 BBY and 26 BBY. The Whiphid was inducted into the Jedi Order and taken to the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant for training. In 22 BBY, Jempa was one of two Whiphid members of the Bear Clan, a class of Jedi younglings all aged between four and eight years old. During a class taught by Grand Master Yoda, Jempa and the rest of Bear Clan donned youngling helmets that blocked their vision. This helped them to see using the Force rather than with their bodily senses alone while learning to sense blaster bolts fired by remotes and block them with training lightsabers.\nThe lesson was interrupted by the arrival of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, which caused Yoda to pause and have Jempa and the other younglings greet the visitor in unison. Kenobi returned the greeting and then explained to Yoda that he was searching for a planet that he could not find in the Jedi Archives. Yoda joked that losing a planet must be embarrassing for Kenobi, eliciting a giggle from the younglings. He then had them all gather around the room's map reader, from which Kenobi projected a holographic star map and showed where the planet ought to be. After Jempa's classmate J. K. Burtola suggested someone had erased the planet from the archives, Yoda instructed Kenobi to seek the world out.\nJempa had gray skin and blue eyes.\nWhile in class, Jempa wore brown Jedi robes with a tan shirt and pants underneath. The Whiphid also wore a brown belt and boots and used a gray training helmet and a green training lightsaber.\nJempa appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The character was portrayed by a child actor with digital effects used to add the alien head and hands, as well as the helmet. Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard oversaw the casting call for actors to play the younglings on July 7, 2000, after which the scenes in the Jedi Temple were shot on July 20, 2000, in Fox Studios, Sydney. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was identified in an entry for the Bear Clan in the StarWars.com Databank. The name was first used in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it appeared on packaging for a figure of Jempa released in 2003 by Hasbro Inc. as part of the Star Wars Saga toy line.",
