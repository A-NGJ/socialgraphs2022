 "content": "Marsh Limoth was a Human male Imperial Governor of Goroth Prime installed in 17 BBY.\nHe turned against his father when he withdrew his support of Palpatine, and was rewarded for his loyalty by being assigned the \"Personal Assistant\" of the Moff of the Trans-Nebular Sector, Nebin Cray. Nebin, not wanting a Personal Assistant, proposed Marsh to be the Colonial Governor of Goroth when the old one expressed desire to resign, and Marsh was made so.",
