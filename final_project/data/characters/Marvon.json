 "content": "Marvon was a Twi'lek male xenospecialist who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War against the Galactic Republic. During the war he was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock, a space station within the Imperial fleet. While on board, Marvon wore a bronze and blue suit of armor and sold various equipment from a desk.\nMarvon first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online roleplaying video game. In the game he served as an Imperial ultimate gear vendor, accepting only commendations as payment. Marvon's armor conceals what species he is in the game. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
