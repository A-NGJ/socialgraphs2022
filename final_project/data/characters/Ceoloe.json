 "content": "Ceoloe was a male Human who, during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, worked at a cantina in the Blasted Asteroid commercial chain on the space station known as The Wheel. He was the cantina's best bouncer and bartender, being able to handle bar-fights due to his large and muscled physique. Ceoloe was often talkative and obsequious with his customers, but would purposefully make revealing comments loudly while talking to alert Waroon Dak, a Corellian infochant, to potential sources of information. Dak paid Ceoloe a finder's fee for these tips as well as for the use of a table near the bar where he plied his trade. The bartender also kept a close eye on the infochant, and would pull him to safety in any bar-fight or if his clients caused him trouble.\nCeoloe first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. He was included as someone that players could potentially interact with while searching for information on the Wheel.",
