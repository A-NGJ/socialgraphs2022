 "content": "Novane was a male Kadas'sa'Nikto criminal who was a henchman of a local crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Novane's lieutenants were known as \"Cold-Blooded Brothers.\"\nNovane appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Novane can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon G-77, which appears on the planets Dromund Kaas, Coruscant, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, and Alderaan. The player has the option to kill him or capture him alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord he worked for, where he was encountered, and him fate.",
