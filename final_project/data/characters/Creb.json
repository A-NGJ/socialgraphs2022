 "content": "Creb was a TIE fighter pilot and lieutenant in the Imperial Navy.\nCreb was one of the few TIE fighter pilots to survive more than ten combat missions; the Battle of Endor was his sixteenth mission in less than two years. He was placed in command of the TIE fighters of the Chimaera, forming Black Wing Squadron. The squadron was secretly based on Rogue Squadron, which he had much respect for and wished to fly against one day. Creb donated his DNA to become a template for clone stormtroopers.",
