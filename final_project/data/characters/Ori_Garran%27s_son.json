 "content": "A Keshiri male was the son of Ori Garran, a member of the same species. Garran sent their son, whose work at a mill they deemed disatisfactory, to learn from scholars including geologist Adari Vaal. The male learnt of several theories which contradicted the Keshiri beliefs from the academics. In 5000 BBY, Vaal reminded the Keshiri's parent of why they had sent their son to the scholars during her hearing before the Wild Space planet Kesh's ruling council, the Neshtovar.\nGarran's son was mentioned in John Jackson Miller's 2009 eBook Lost Tribe of the Sith: Skyborn, the second installment of Miller's Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith series.",
