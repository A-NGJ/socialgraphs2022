 "content": "Haemon Alde was a Human male member of the noble House Alde from the planet Alderaan. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Alde was kidnapped by pirates from his protectors, who were in the service of Alde's ally House Organa, and ransomed back for a large sum of credits.\nHaemon Alde was first mentioned in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, in the Underworld Training crew skill mission \"Ransom Demands.\" The initial text for the mission refers to him as \"Haemon Lear,\" but the completion text labels him as Haemon Alde and references the Organa family.",
