 "content": "Irol was a Human male clone native of an Outer Rim forest planet, where he learned how to fly a speeder bike. By 4 ABY, he had become a scout trooper sergeant in the Galactic Empire, and was part of the garrison stationed on the Forest Moon of Endor, whose assignment was to defend the shield generator bunker protecting the orbiting second Death Star. That year, Irol took part in the Battle of Endor, where he and the rest of the garrison unsuccessfully attempted to defend the shield generator from a Rebel Alliance strike team.\nThe Human male Irol was a clone who hailed from a forest planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. It was on that planet where he learned how to fly a speeder bike. By the year 4 ABY, Irol joined the Galactic Empire as a scout trooper, and attained the military rank of sergeant. He became a member of the Imperial garrison stationed on the Forest Moon of Endor, whose assignment was to protect the shield generator bunker for the orbiting Imperial second Death Star. In 4 ABY, Irol and the garrison took part in the Battle of Endor, during which a Rebel Alliance strike team infiltrated the forest moon with the intention to destroy the shield generator. The battle ended with the Alliance successfully destroying the shield generator, allowing the Alliance Fleet to destroy the unprotected Death Star in space.\nA confident biker scout and hunter, Irol relied on superior balance and strength to operate his 74-Z speeder bike. Irol's balance and flying skills made him a valuable, though cocky, member of the Imperial garrison on Endor.\nIrol wore a full suit of scout trooper armor and wielded a scout trooper blaster pistol.\nOriginally pictured in an onset photo for the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, Irol was first brought into the Star Wars Legends continuity that year by Topps Collectibles for their 1983 Topps Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Series 1 and 1983 Topps Return of the Jedi Album Stickers sets, as well as in the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Sticker Album. A picture of the scout trooper was used in May 1994's short story \"Whispers in the Dark,\" written by Charlene Newcomb for West End Games' Star Wars Adventure Journal 2, thus marking Irol's first in-universe appearance. In 1999, he was first identified by name on a card for the Endor Limited set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, with the name simultaneously being used in the gameplay statistic text for another character, Corporal Drelosyn.",
