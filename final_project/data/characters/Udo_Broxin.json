 "content": "Udo Broxin was a Herglic who was a regular at the entertainment and gambling establishment known as the Ace of Sabres on the planet Kluistar.\nUdo was a fixture at the Ace of Sabres for as long as anyone could remember. The manager, Gandin T'Noull, even allowed the Herglic's large bar tab to go largely unpaid since Udo's presence always had such a positive effect on the atmosphere of the Ace of Sabers.\nUdo was witty, sarcastic and outgoing. He enjoyed nothing more than a good drink, a game of sabacc and a brawl before bed. His good humor and sense of fun lifted the other patrons mood. He was loud and boisterous, and had the tendency to draw others to his mayhem and mischief.\nHe referred to himself as \"Uncle Udo\" and was always willing to dispense advice to those that were willing to listen. He also had a tendency to ramble on even when no-one was listening.\nUdo Broxin was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.",
