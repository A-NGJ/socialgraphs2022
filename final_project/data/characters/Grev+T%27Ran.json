 "content": "Grev T'Ran was a male Human who served as a commander in the Galactic Empire.\nIn 0 ABY, T'Ran was among the ten individuals summoned by Emperor Palpatine to his throne room where the Emperor delivered the news of the first Death Star's destruction. Using the Force, Palpatine was able to detect T'Ran's reaction to the news—almost making him smile—which confirmed his suspicions that T'ran was a Rebel sympathizer. Palpatine ordered one of his Royal Guards to kill T'Ran, who grabbed his blaster and tried to resist before being stabbed in the neck with a force pike.",
