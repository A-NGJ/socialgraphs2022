 "content": "Nikaede Celso was a female Wookiee who was the companion of Drake Paulsen. She was 2.4 meters tall, which was large for her species. She was also very clever and a talented technician. She was patient and diligent, but did have a tendency to whine during a crisis.\nNikaede was born of a noble family on Kashyyyk and smuggled from the planet through a selfless sacrifice by her parents. She had no idea what happened to her friends and family, and as a result usually bonded with down-on-their-luck people that she met.",
