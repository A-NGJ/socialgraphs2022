 "content": "CC-5576-39, known as \"Gregor,\" was a clone commando who served as a captain in the 212th Attack Battalion of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He suffered amnesia when the Galactic Republic's forces were defeated by the Separatists on the planet Sarrish. Gregor eventually ended up on the Outer Rim world Abafar, where the Sullustan Borkus took advantage of the clone's lack of memory and employed him as a dishwasher at his diner. However, Colonel Meebur Gascon and the D-Squad, who were searching for a way back to the Republic after recovering a Confederate encryption module, helped Gregor gain his memory back and convinced him to aid their mission. The clone commando distracted the forces at the local Rhydonium mining installation while Gascon and the D-Squad escaped Abafar.\nUnit CC-5576-39, known by the nickname \"Gregor,\" was a Human male born on the planet Kamino. He was cloned from the template of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, and received training as a clone commando, earning the rank of captain. He served in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic as part of the Special Operations Brigade during the Clone Wars, which launched in 22 BBY. Two years later, Gregor and his squad were part of the 212th Attack Battalion, and participated in the Republic's assault against the Separatists on the planet Sarrish, during the Outer Rim Sieges. The forces of the Republic suffered severe casualties during the battle, and Gregor, who tried to find help for his fellow clone troopers, suffered amnesia and ended up on a shuttle. The shuttle carrying him crashed on the planet Abafar, which was also in the Outer Rim, and the Sullustan Borkus, who owned the Power Sliders diner in the city of Pons Ora, rescued Gregor. The commando's lack of memory was taken advantage of by Borkus, who rented an apartment in the city and employed the clone as a dishwasher in the diner.\nEventually, the Zilkin Colonel, Meebur Gascon and the pit droid WAC-47—who along with the other members of the D-Squad, were searching for a way to escape Abafar and reach the galactic capital Coruscant—entered Power Sliders looking for nourishment. After Borkus refused to serve the duo, Gregor encountered Gascon and WAC-47 in the back of the diner searching through the garbage. After Gregor offered the Zilkin something to eat, Gascon recognized the amnesiac as a clone, confirming his suspicions with further inspection. Gregor was commanded by Gascon, who believed he was on an undercover mission, to aid them. However, Gregor returned to work when Borkus called for him, leaving Gascon and WAC-47 in the alley. After Borkus closed the diner for the day, Gregor questioned him about his own identity, and the Sullustan brushed the questions off and told Gregor not to ask about them again.\nAfter arriving at his apartment, Gregor encountered a hologram of the clone captain CT-7567, and was confronted by Gascon and the members of the D-Squad, who attempted to jog his memory. Gregor only remembered waking up on a transport ship and crashing on Abafar, and also recalled Borkus rescuing him. Gregor's left wrist, which was marked with an identifying code, was scanned by the astromech R2-D2 to reveal the amnesiac soldier's unit number, rank and status as a clone commando. Gregor began to vaguely recall the events of the Battle of Sarrish, and Gascon convinced Gregor to join them in completing their mission. After he trimmed his hair and shaved his beard, Gregor, Gascon, and the droids went to Power Sliders, where the commando believed his armor and equipment were being kept by Borkus. As Gregor and the D-Squad were searching for his equipment at the diner, Borkus confronted them and threatened Gregor with his DC-17 blaster rifle. The Sullustan informed them that the Separatists were mining rhydonium, a volatile fuel, in order to destroy the Republic cruiser in Abafar's orbit. When Gregor tried to grab the weapon from Borkus, the Sullustan hit the commando and taunted him; however; Borkus was disarmed and restrained by the D-Squad.\nGregor, Gascon, and the droids headed to the local Rhydonium mining installation. After verifying Borkus's claims, Gregor told the Colonel and the droids to head straight for the attack shuttle as he covered their escape. The commando began to dispatch the battle droids guarding the facility, targeting various barrels of rhydonium in order to destroy the facility's operations and to provide cover for the D-Squad. When Gascon and the astromech M5-BZ were separated from the group, Gregor retrieved them and provided more cover fire. As the D-Squad made their escape aboard the shuttle, Gregor targeted more of the rhydonium barrels as he was being overrun by the droid forces, resulting in the facility's destruction. The Colonel promised that Gregor's sacrifice would not be forgotten and he and D-Squad would watch for his return to the Republic.\nWhen Meebur Gascon discovered Gregor, he was confused and not very confident and spoke in a low voice. He thought Borkus was doing a good thing for him by letting him get an apartment and work as a dishwasher for money. When Gregor asked what a clone was, Borkus told them they were brave and skilled soldiers and that was something Gregor was not. As D-Squad began to reassemble, Gregor's personality changed. He became confident and spoke louder in a brave and proud voice. He then realize Borkus was treating him like a slave, and became a proud soldier for the Republic once again. He was brave and daring enough to go on the task to destroy entire mining facility and a whole battalion of droids and even promise his superiors that he would return. He also put other lives before his own and let D-Squad escape while he stayed to fight.\nAs a clone commando with advanced training, Gregor was extremely proficient with weapons, and managed to take on an entire base full of droids by himself, destroying super battle droids, droidekas and battle droids using his wit and skill, only becoming surrounded after breaking position to save the Colonel. Gregor possessed excellent accuracy compared to his clone brethren, being able to shoot droids in the head while jumping and running from cover to cover.\nGregor appears to be proud of his achievements in destroying droids prior to his amnesia, as he openly keeps a tally of his droid kill count on his helmet.\nGregor wore Katarn-class commando armor with digital camo and yellow/orange markings, representing his membership in the 212th Attack Battalion. He carried a DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System for a weapon. His helmet featured tally marks to represent the number of droids he had destroyed: they tallied up to 250, the most of any clone who was seen tallying their droid kill count.\nGregor made his first appearance in \"Missing in Action,\" an episode in the fifth season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. The preview clip that Gregor appears in was shown at Celebration VI. He is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. In a Season 5 trailer of the Clone Wars, the Aurebesh that displays on Gregor's profile notes that he went missing in action during the Battle of Sarrish.\nDuring the episode, a hologram showing Gregor's military records was displayed in Aurebesh after R2-D2 scanned his identifying code. As well as displaying Gregor's status as MIA during the Battle of Sarrish, it displayed 'Captain', '212 Attack Battalion'  and 'Foxtrot Group', as well as Gregor's height and weight. The designation of Captain contradicts Colonel Gascon stating that Gregor was Captain, despite the fact that Gascon was going off of the hologram.\nGregor's helmet markings are based on the hash-marks that Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers stenciled on his mask to denote the stitches he would have gotten had he not been wearing protective gear.",
