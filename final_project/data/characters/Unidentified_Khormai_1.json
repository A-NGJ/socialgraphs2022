 "content": "A Khormai accompanied another member of the Khormai species in the casino within Attuma Duum's headquarters on an asteroid near Cavamina Minor c. 21 BBY. The two Khormai were present at the destruction of Galactic Republic and Separatist flotillas that had been lured into the mined asteroid field by Duum. When a Human named Shon-Ju infiltrated Duum's base and disabled its shields, however, the station itself came under threat of the mined asteroids and was destroyed.",
