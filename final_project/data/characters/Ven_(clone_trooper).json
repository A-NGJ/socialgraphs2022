 "content": "Ven was a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Like his clone brethren, he was a Human male who stood 1.83 meters tall.\n476 days after the Battle of Geonosis, Ven fought on the planet Qiilura, along with Jedi General Etain Tur-Mukan, to remove colonists from the Gurlanins' home, as the colonists were destroying the natural food chain. Ven was operating an E-Web heavy repeating blaster, but was wounded when an artillery round hit him. Clone Commander Levet replaced him on the turret after he fell unconscious. His fellow clone troopers gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and other field medical procedures to keep him alive until the medical teams were able to arrive. Etain was able to determine that he was alive even though his brothers could not find a pulse. Ven was then taken to medical care.\nVen was a clone trooper introduced in the 2007 novel Republic Commando: True Colors, written by Karen Traviss.",
