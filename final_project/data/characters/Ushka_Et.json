 "content": "Ushka Et was the Devaronian lead singer of the band Distraction. She stood out from other people because of the design of her tattoo; half of her face was tattooed to look like she had been in a horrible disfiguring accident, although with a close-up view it became apparent that she had not been. Ushka had done this for the sake of attention and she was very self-conscious about her actions. Although she wasn't ashamed of her original body art, she preferred that people didn't stare at her tattoos unless she was performing. Therefore, when she talked to people, she tended to turn the tattooed half of her face away from the person.",
