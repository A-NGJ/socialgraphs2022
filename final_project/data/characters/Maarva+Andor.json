 "content": "Maarva Andor was a human female who lived during the final years of the Galactic Republic and into the Imperial age. She was the adoptive mother of Cassian Jeron Andor.\nPrior to the Clone Wars, Maarva and her husband, Clem, discovered a young Cassian, then known as Kassa, while smuggling on the planet Kenari. Fearing he would be in danger by those who would come by next, Maarva and Clem adopted Kassa, named him Cassian Andor, and brought him back to their homeworld of Ferrix. Maarva was revered by the community, even after she retired from hard labor. However, Clem was hung by the Galactic Empire at Rix Road, leaving Maarva a widow. By 5 BBY, her health had begun to fail. She also began to disapprove of Cassian's independent streak, believing that he was ruining his health and reputation.\nThat year, Maarva discovered that Cassian was being hunted by Preox-Morlana after he killed two Corpos on Morlana One. She confronted her adoptive son and scolded him for having revealed to the Pre-Mor authorities that his home planet was Kenari and not Fest, which the Andor family had reported was his official homeworld. In the ensuing hunt, Deputy Inspector Syril Karn and his team visited Maarva's house and confronted her in the hopes she would reveal where her adoptive son was. Before the Pre-Mor authorities could do anything, however, Cassian and Luthen Rael evaded capture and left Ferrix, leaving Maarva behind.\nMaarva was portrayed by Fiona Shaw. Her name was revealed in the subtitles for the first Andor trailer.",
