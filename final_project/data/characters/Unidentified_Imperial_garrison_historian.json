 "content": "A male Human individual served as an Imperial garrison historian during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, the Imperial garrison historian was an Imperial officer who maintained important records.\nIn 1 ABY, during the Empire Day festivities, he resided in the city of Narmle on Rori. It was there that he met Imperial spacers, sent to help him by an Imperial PR officer. The historian had an important mission for the spacers, which involved acquiring a historical disk which he needed for a report he was writing. The Imperials had the choice to either slay a number of Rebel foes for the disk, or meet up with a noble in the Bestine tavern. Finally, they successfully acquire the disk.\nIt was then that the Imperial spacers had to continue his mission, by meeting up with a commoner in Bela Vistal. The commoner instructed the Imperials to meet up with another individual in Dee'ja Peak. Upon doing so, Imperial promptly returned to the historian, to inform him that he had completed his mission. Yet the mission was not truly complete, for the historian had the Imperial visit an Imperial data officer at the Dathomir Science Outpost.\nAn Imperial garrison historian, who lacks an official name, appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Imperial garrison historian was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. During the 2005 Empire Day live event from June 29 to July 11, 2005, he could be found in Narmle and was part of a quest titled \"Happy Empire Day!,\" which sent players on an important mission throughout the galaxy. After the live event ended, the Imperial garrison historian never reappeared in the game since the Empire Day event was discontinued until its complete overhaul in 2008.",
