 "content": "Jhorval was a Human male who served the Sith Empire on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas. At some point either prior to or during the Cold War he joined the cult known as the Revanites, in which he worked his way up to the rank of Elder. He was tasked with directing new cult members in the Ritual of Rebirth, where members were to visit a cave which served as a shrine dedicated to Darth Revan. Inside the cave, the ritual incapacitated the new members and they were brought back to the camp. The purpose of the ritual was to make new members feel reborn, like Revan once was, to leave behind their current lives and dedicate themselves to the Order of Revan.",
