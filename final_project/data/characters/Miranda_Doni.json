 "content": "Miranda Doni was a female Human who served as a starfighter pilot with the New Republic Defense Fleet.\nAssigned to the Fifth Battle Group as a K-wing pilot, she relished their role as \"heavy hitters\" and was a competitor for the position of commander within her squadron. At some point, she and her K-Wing managed to enter combat with a TIE fighter over a forested planet, where she managed to destroy the TIE pursuing her via the K-Wing's turrets shooting behind. During the failed blockade of Doornik-319, Doni pulled out of her bombing run when she heard the pleas of Yevethan prisoners that had been broadcast on an open channel. In the subsequent counterattack, Doni and a number of other exposed K-wing pilots were killed when their craft were shot down.",
