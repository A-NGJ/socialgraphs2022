 "content": "In the aftermath of the Yuuzhan Vong War, a female Force-sensitive Yuuzhan Vong was seduced and trained in the dark side of the Force.\nMost of the activities of this Dark Jedi were unknown, but it was known that she corrupted the Jedi Knight Daye Azur-Jamin. Hiding in the Cloak of the Sith region, she then managed to capture Kyle Katarn who was investigating rumors of a reemergence of the Sith.\nKyle Katarn was rescued by a team put together by Jan Ors, Mara Jade Skywalker and Jaden Korr. The cyborg Daye was subsequently turned back to the light. He then revealed not only the presence of this Force-sensitive Yuuzhan Vong, but also that she had a master.\nThis Dark Jedi was mentioned in an adventure seed in The Dark Forces Saga. She has no official name but was dubbed Vongerella on the Jedi Council Forums. Abel G. Peña later used the name informally.\nAccording to Peña, the Vader's Legacy article was going to include a backstory and name for her; the article, however, was canceled by Lucasfilm Ltd.",
