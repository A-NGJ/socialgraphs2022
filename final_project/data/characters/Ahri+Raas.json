 "content": "Ahri Raas was a Force-sensitive Keshiri male from the planet of Kesh. A Tyro in the Lost Tribe of Sith, he trained with the Tribe around the time of the Second Galactic Civil War. After taking part in a competition to win an uvak, he befriended fellow Tyro Vestara Khai. Raas and Khai were present when the Tribe first encountered Ship, a Sith Meditation Sphere, in 41 ABY. In 43.5 ABY, shortly after Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker's presence was felt by the Tribe, Ship abruptly left Kesh. By this time, Raas had been apprenticed to Sith Master Yuvar Xal.\nRaas and Xal were chosen as members of the strike team sent to recover Ship and kill Skywalker. Aboard the Eternal Crusader, they tracked Ship to a planet in the Maw, where they met Abeloth, a mysterious woman who pretended to befriend and assist the Sith. Still, the strike team suffered heavy losses, and Xal planned to initiate a coup against the team's leader, Lady Rhea. Before the betrayal could be executed, however, Ship returned to the Sith and transported them to Sinkhole Station, a space station in the Maw. There, they ambushed Skywalker and his son, Ben. Xal, however, had ordered Raas to kill Khai as part of his coup against Rhea. When Khai threw her grenades at the Skywalkers, Raas pushed them back at her. Rhea, however, had anticipated his betrayal and had given Khai false grenades to throw first. As Raas attempted to apprehend a seemingly stunned Ben Skywalker, Khai killed Xal. Raas, distracted by his Master's cry of surprise and pain, was quickly killed by a lightsaber strike from Ben, unaffected by the stun grenade.\nAhri Raas was a male Force-sensitive Keshiri and Sith Tyro. He trained with the Lost Tribe of Sith—descendants of a group of Sith whose starship, the Omen, had crash-landed on the planet of Kesh around 5000 BBY, while attempting to transport Lignan crystals to Sith Lord Naga Sadow during the Great Hyperspace War. Raas, who was a member of the planet's native species rather than a direct descendant of the surviving Sith, was born on Kesh around 27 ABY.\nRaas began training with the Tribe in the ways of the Sith, and, in 37 ABY, he took place in a competition held among the youth of the Tribe to obtain a personal uvak—winged reptilian creatures native to Kesh—by imposing their will on unhatched creatures through the dark side of the Force so that it would \"imprint\" upon the competitor. Raas and the Human Tyro Vestara Khai picked the same uvak, and, after a battle of wills, Khai eventually won. Raas later became a close friend of Khai, whom he often trained with in lightsaber combat.\nIn 41 ABY, after one such training session, they saw a ship fly over them, toward the ruins of the Omen—which had become known as the Ship of Destiny—in the Sith Temple. Khai called her uvak, Tikk, and she and Raas took the creature to find the ship. They found the spherical vessel in the middle of the Temple courtyard, where many Sith had already gathered, and the ship began to speak to Khai through the Force. The Tribe, having finally acquired a way to leave the planet, began to use the ship to attack and capture starships to form an armada. In 43.5 ABY, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker touched an Aing-Tii relic, the Codex, sending out a call through the Force which alerted the Tribe to the threat he presented. Shortly afterward, Ship abruptly departed the planet of Kesh. By that time, Raas had been taken as an apprentice under the Sith Master Yuvar Xal.\nXal and Raas were chosen to be a part of the strike team whose task was to recover Ship and return it to Kesh, and hunt down and kill Skywalker. The team, aboard the warship Eternal Crusader, followed Ship, using Khai's unique connection to the Meditation Sphere to track it. This caused some unrest among the crew, and the Sith debated why it would allow Khai to track it, as well as what it was doing to begin with. Raas suggested that it was leading them into a trap, and, though Lady Olaris Rhea, the strike team's leader, agreed, she decided that they had to follow it anyway. They tracked it to a planet in the Maw, where Raas and Xal were chosen by Rhea to be a part of the search party sent down to the planet to find Ship. On the planet they met Abeloth, a powerful being who pretended to help the Tribe, while actually sabotaging their efforts to escape with Ship. Meanwhile, Raas was tasked by Xal with getting closer to Khai and gaining her trust in order to stage a coup against Rhea, so Xal could take over the strike team's leadership.\nAs the search continued without success, Rhea finally decided that they should just leave without Ship, and Xal decided that it was time to execute his coup. Before either of these could happen, however, the Meditation Sphere suddenly reappeared. As the search party took up pursuit, Rhea was attacked by a siphon reed and pulled into a whirlpool. Khai jumped in to save her master, and as they resurfaced, Raas grasped them in the Force to bring them safely to shore. The search went on fruitlessly, and several more Sith arrived on shuttles from the Eternal Crusader to join the search party until there were no crew members left aboard the ship. Eventually, however, Abeloth discovered Skywalkers location, and allowed Ship to return to the Sith. The strike team left to kill Luke Skywalker and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, in Sinkhole Station, a space station in the Maw.\nThere, Raas, Xal, Khai, and Sith Saber Baad Walusari were set up at a juntion in the station which the Skywalkers would have to pass in order to get to their ship in the station's hangar. They were commanded to ambush the Skywalkers with grenades, but Raas was ordered by Xal to betray his friend and Force push her grenades back at her when she threw them at the Skywalkers. When the Jedi arrived on the scene after escaping from their first confrontation with members of the strike team, Khai and Walusari threw their grenades at them, and Raas and Xal quickly pushed the explosives back at the two Sith as they threw their own stun grenades. Rhea, however, had expected treachery, and had provided Khai with fake grenades. Meanwhile, the Skywalkers pretended to have been knocked unconscious, and Raas prepared to restrain the younger Jedi. Upset by Raas' betrayal, Khai threw her shikkar at Xal, killing him. Raas was distracted by his master's cry of shock and anguish, and was quickly killed, sliced down the spine by the lightsaber of Ben Skywalker, when Ahri had been attempting to subdue him.\nAhri Raas had a somewhat relaxed outlook on life, and was not as competitive or ambitious as his friend, Vestara Khai. He was also rather compassionate, and cared deeply about Khai; however, Khai shared no romantic feelings for him. He wasn't afraid to speak out among higher-ranking Sith, as he offered his theory to Rhea as to why Ship was allowing only Khai to track it. Later, Raas was troubled by Xal's orders to gain Khai's trust in order to betray her. However, he was loyal to his master, and carried out his commands, betraying Khai and attempting to kill her when the time came.\nRaas often trained in lightsaber combat and frequently and effectively used telekinesis techniques. He was not as accomplished in these areas as Khai, however, and he lacked the necessary focus, causing him to fall prey to Khai's use of Dun Möch. During the battle with the Skywalkers, he and his master underestimated the Jedi, believing incorrectly that stun grenades could incapacitate them. Raas was distracted by Xal's cry of pain as the Sith Master was killed, resulting in his own death. Raas had white hair, red eyes, and pale purple skin.\nAhri Raas was created as a minor character by author Christie Golden for Fate of the Jedi: Omen, her debut Star Wars novel and the second volume in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series.",
