 "content": "Hobbrock was a giant walking fish that lived in the Coruscant underworld. It was the pet fish of Phelon, a criminal mastermind hiding in an ancient castle on the shore of what locals referred to as the burning water. The fish swam in the boiling, sulfurous water, defending against intruders. Hobbrock readily responded to the commands of its master, and it loved to eat glowworms.",
