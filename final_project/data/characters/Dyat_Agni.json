 "content": "Dyat Agni was a female Devaronian songstress who resided on the planet Coruscant during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Agni was a member of the Whiplash, an anti-Imperial resistance group, and following the capture of the group's leader Thi Xon Yimmon by the Empire in about 18 BBY, Agni and several other members of the group met aboard a hovertrain on the lower levels of Coruscant, to discuss how the Whiplash would respond to Yimmon's loss. At the proposal of the Sakiyan Tuden Sal, a Whiplash Council was formed to take over the leadership of the group in Yimmon's absence, and Agni served as a member of the council. Shortly thereafter, Agni and most of her fellow Whiplash Council members perished during a botched attempt to assassinate the Imperial ruler Emperor Palpatine.",
