 "content": "Karssk, also known as Karssk the Mighty, was a notorious Trandoshan slaver and hunter who specialized in targeting the Wookiee species at some point before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Karssk attempted to kill the famous Wookiee gladiator Bowdaar on the planet Ord Mantell, but Bowdaar defeated the hunter in combat, solidifying his title as the galaxy's greatest gladiator. However, Karssk's death and \"dishonor\" at Bowdaar's hand led to a bounty being issued on the Wookiee by the Trandoshani Hunters Alliance.\nKarssk was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Bowdaar in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia later confirmed Karssk's species and death. At some point during the development of The Old Republic, Karssk was intended to appear either in person or in a conversation, as he is listed in the game's NPC files.",
