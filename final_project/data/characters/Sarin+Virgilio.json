 "content": "Sarin Virgilio was a Masterran Human starship officer of the Rebel Alliance and New Republic.\nVirgilio was a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Prior to the Battle of Endor he served as third officer on a Corellian Gunship. His ship rescued the six remaining members of a Bothan Spynet team that had been working in the Outer Rim Territories. Impressed by their bravery he became a strong supporter of the Bothans, and of Councilor Borsk Fey'lya.\nDuring the Thrawn crisis, Virgilio, now promoted to Captain, commanded the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Quenfis, part of the Home Guard Fleet. Borsk Fey'lya sent him to arrest Han Solo and his companions during the Katana fleet incident. During the conflict Fey'lya was tricked into revealing his true intentions, and Virgilio proved himself loyal to the New Republic by supporting Solo and Rogue Squadron in the ensuing battle.\nAccording to his entry in the Dark Force Rising Sourcebook , it was his ship that recovered the Bothans carrying the Death Star II plans, conflicting with Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire.",
