 "content": "Pelleo Thog was a rich, successful male Human businessman who owned an estate on the planet Torina in the Elrood sector during the reign of the Galactic Empire. During the Galactic Civil War, he possessed a large collection of exotic animals. As Thog's wealth increased, he bought more and more animals, until his wife eventually complained about the size of his menagerie and he rehoused them inside a zoo, in the grounds of his estate. During the Galactic Civil War, Thog held a party on his estate, which was attended by some of his friends and business colleagues, as well as the Imperial Star Destroyer captains Alistar Dadefra and Tanda Pryl. Around the same time, Thog purchased a rare, albino Farlek from the Ithorian pet shop owner Eeksa.\nThog was a bald, obese man, who was jovial and held a fascination for rare creatures. He was also a keen sportsman and he was skilled in the use of weapons such as sporting firearms and bow weapons.",
