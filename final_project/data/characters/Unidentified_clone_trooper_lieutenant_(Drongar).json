 "content": "A clone trooper served in the Grand Army of the Republic as a lieutenant on the planet Drongar in 20 BBY. During his stay on the planet, the lieutenant witnessed the explosion of a carrier transporting bota, a plant with substantial medicinal qualities. Together with two other beings, the lieutenant speculated on what had caused the explosion.\nLike all clone troopers, the clone trooper lieutenant was a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett and was bred on the planet Kamino to fight for the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars. In 20 BBY, the lieutenant served on the Outer Rim planet Drongar, where the Republic clashed with the Confederacy of Independent Systems over the planet's fields of botaâ€”a highly valuable plant that had extensive medicinal assets. During his stay on Drongar, the lieutenant witnessed the explosion of a bota carrier at the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7. While the lieutenant suspected that the ship had exploded due to a shield failure, a nearby Ishi Tib technician stated that such an event was impossible. The lieutenant then asked how many beings had been aboard the vessel, and a Human informed him that there had been two loaders and a pilot aboard the carrier. Unbeknownst to the Republic, the traitor Klo Merit had sabotaged the vessel.\nAfter seeing the explosion of the carrier, the lieutenant whistled in awe and was quick to assume the event had been caused by shield failure. After being told otherwise, the trooper asked how many lives the tragedy had claimed and considered the loss of three people a shame. Like all clone troopers, he stood 1.83 meters tall.\nAs a lieutenant, the clone trooper wore blue clone trooper armor.\nThe clone lieutenant had a brief appearance in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, the first novel of the MedStar Duology. Battle Surgeons was written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry, and was published in 2004.",
