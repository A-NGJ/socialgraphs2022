 "content": "Dooni's mother was a quadruped who lived on the forest moon of Endor. The protective mother of Dooni, she was the leader of her Foonar herd. She was once enslaved by a species of green-skinned harvesters from another world. She was later freed from her shackles by Wicket Wystri Warrick, Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, and her own Dooni. She then helped the Ewoks turn the slavers' own harvester machine against them, driving them away from the forest moon.",
