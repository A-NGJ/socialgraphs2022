 "content": "Xuvi Ruun was a female Zabrak who lived in the Anoat sector at the time of the Iron Blockade. She had a background in diplomacy, allowing her to exude compassion and trustworthiness when speaking to people. Ruun's goal was to convince civilians to stand up to oppression, and she joined the crew of a young smuggler to spread her message.\nXuvi Ruun was created for Star Wars: Uprising, a mobile game released in 2015. Ruun is one of the many crew members that can be used on Crew Runs to collect helpful items.",
