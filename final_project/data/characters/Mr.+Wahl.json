 "content": "Mr. Wahl was a slacker who lived off the fortunes of his surgeon wife, Dr. Wahl. He shared a number of bad habits with his wife, such as gambling, which his son Kris also picked up. When it came to Kris's efforts at philanthropy, Mr. Wahl seemed to share his wife's opinions, disapproving of them as a waste of money. The Wahls were more concerned about Kris's association with Gerta Haman than they were about his gambling debts.\nWhen Kris went missing in 31 BBY, Mr. Wahl and his wife assumed he had gone off with Gerta Haman on some sort of \"foolish mission.\" This was not far from the truth, as he had joined her Cularin resistance.",
