 "content": "Elio Bonton was a high-class gambler who made a living separating young Tapani nobles from their money. The young nobles found him very entertaining and he always had an interesting tale or amusing story to tell. Older nobles didn't like Elio although they could not dissuade their children from interacting with him.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War Bonton was a handsome man in his early thirties who dressed well and was said to carry himself like a warrior. Several House intelligence agencies tried to recruit him but he was not interested.",
