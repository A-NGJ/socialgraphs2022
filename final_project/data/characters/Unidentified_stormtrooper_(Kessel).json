 "content": "This stormtrooper was a human male member of the Stormtrooper Corps five years before the Battle of Yavin. During the mission to free Wookiee prisoners undertaken by the rebel crew of the Ghost, this stormtrooper was stationed in the spice mines of the planet Kessel. He attempted to capture Kitwarr, a young Wookiee slave, but was stopped by Ezra Bridger, who fired an energy slingshot at him and sent him over a railing. While hanging on to a support pillar, he asked Agent Kallus, who had also been knocked over the railing by one of his own blaster bolts, which Kanan Jarrus had deflected into his cuirass, if Jarrus was the first Jedi the agent had encountered. Kallus responded by kicking the trooper off the pole into the mines below.\nThis stormtrooper is voiced by Steve Blum, who voices Garazeb Orrelios in Star Wars Rebels.",
