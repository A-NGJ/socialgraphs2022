 "content": "Palter was a human who worked for the Confederacy of Independent Systems in a droid factory on the planet Mokivj under the Serennian Duke Solha in 19 BBY during the Clone Wars. They were escorted by a squad of B1-series battle droids in the factory's courtyard while Duke Solha talked with the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.\nAfter Solha commanded all the battle droids present to lower their weapons, he ordered the droids escorting Palter to help the human with a shipment and to wait until another battle droid squad, Team Three, arrived with several workers to assure that the shipment was completely unloaded and properly stacked.\nPalter was mentioned in the second storyline of the 2018 novel Thrawn: Alliances, the second installment in the Star Wars: Thrawn novel series by Timothy Zahn.",
