 "content": "Vranki, known as Vranki the Blue, was a male Hutt who ran a hotel and casino.\nAs proprietor, host, and promoter of Vranki's Hotel and Casino, Vranki the Blue's corpulent form glided around his resort, overseeing his massive empire of gambling and racing. Although he prided himself in being different than other Hutts, Vranki wasn't above cheating to ensure the odds are in his favor, especially when a substantial prize was on the line.\nVranki first appeared Star Wars Resistance episode \"The Voxx Vortex 5000\", voiced by John DiMaggio. Vranki's original name in the outline of the episode was \"Janki\", but was later changed. According to art director Amy Beth Christenson, Vranki was originally supposed to wear a hat, but it was changed during the design phase to a Lando Calrissian-like cape. To differentiate him from the other Hutts, Vranki was given a more friendly face and an up-turned nose.",
