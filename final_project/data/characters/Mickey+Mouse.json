 "content": "Mickey Mouse, also known as Jedi Mickey, was a pint-sized male Jedi Master who belonged to a species of sapient mice. On occasion, he fought alongside the equally diminutive Yoda, the Grand Master of the Order. During the Clone Wars, he assisted the Galactic Republic in its fight against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with the help of his customized Jedi interceptor and his droid partner R2-MK.\nFollowing the end of the war, Mickey Mouse escaped the Great Jedi Purge and became an adversary of the newly-formed Galactic Empire. During his career, Mouse would never part with his signature white gloves, and he would customize most of his possessions with his personal crest, a stylized version of his head.\nMickey Mouse, a male mouse, was born on the planet of Hyperion during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic. He was Force-sensitive, and ended up joining the Jedi Order. With the Order, he was taught to wield the Force, and to fight with a lightsaber. Mouse rose in the ranks until becoming a Jedi Master.\nDuring his career, he often joined forces with other Jedi Knights including Yoda, the Grand Master of the Jedi Order himself. Mouse greatly benefited from his superior's erudition and understanding nature. Together, the diminutive masters proved that no warrior should be judged by their size, and that defeatism could be conquered. In 22 BBY, an alliance of seceding star systems known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems declared war against the Republic. During the resulting conflict, known as the Clone Wars, the Jedi were called on to lead the Republic's newly formed Grand Army. Mouse was granted his own Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, in which he flew with his astromech droid partner, R2-MK.\nAfter the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic Palpatine established a new regime called the Galactic Empire and sought to eliminate all surviving Jedi Mickey Mouse survived the Galactic Emperor's purge and decided to resist the oppression of the Empire, using his interceptor to battle squadrons of Imperial TIE fighters. During the Dark Times that followed, Mouse experienced many adventures throughout the galaxy with R2-MK. At some point during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, Mickey alongside R2-MK, joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic to resist the Empire. His various activities with the Alliance included a secret mission to Endor, and getting into a dogfight with various Imperials in an X-wing fighter with R2-MK, alongside a StarSpeeder 1000. He accompanied Bree Starlighter, along with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, at the unveiling of Star Tours' first hub in the Earth system.\nMickey Mouse was a diminutive individual, measuring only 0.66 meters. He was in fact the same height as Grand Master Yoda, who would later teach to his last pupil that \"size matters not.\" Mouse had black hair and large black eyes.\nHe wore traditional Jedi apparel, with at least two outfits: one featuring a yellow tunic with cream-colored outer robes, the other with a beige tunic and a brown cloak. He owned pairs of yellow and brown boots, and usually wore a pair of white gloves. The Jedi Master customized some of his possessions with his personal emblem, which consisted of two circles on top of a bigger one—reflecting the shape of his head viewed from the front. The wings of his Jedi interceptor bore that crest, and the droid R2-MK had been given a pair of round ears as a whimsical embellishment.\nLike the lightsaber carried by Yoda, Mickey's was shorter than normal to match his small stature, with its hilt measuring at only 14.00 centimeters and its blade around a half-meter. Its silver and black hilt bore markings that harkened back to Mouse's personality. The top of the hilt featured three lines pointing toward the blade, which were reminiscent of the markings on Mouse's gloves. The activation stud was shaped like his trefoil emblem. Below that ignite button was a frieze of such trefoils that went around the hilt, and the pommel featured Mouse's initial in High Galactic alphabet. When activated, the weapon emitted a blue blade.\nWhen flying an X-wing fighter with the Rebel Alliance, Mickey wore a typical Rebel flight suit and flight helmet.\nMouse, being a Jedi Master, showed exceptional skills and devotion to the Force, as well as great talent in lightsaber combat. In spite of his small stature, he was powerful. He was also a capable pilot, as he could fly an Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor and an X-wing fighter.\nThe non-canon character of Jedi Mickey was one of the life-size interactive costumed characters at Star Wars Weekends, an annual Star Wars festival that was hosted at Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort. He was inspired by Mickey Mouse, the seminal cartoon character and mascot of The Walt Disney Company, who made his screen debut on November 18, 1928 as star of the first synchronized sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie.\nSince December 21, 2012, The Walt Disney Company officially owns Lucasfilm Ltd., the company founded by George Lucas and best known for producing the Star Wars franchise.\nA series of Jedi Mickey-themed toys were designed by a team of Disney Parks product developers led by Brad Schoeneberg. The Hasbro toy company first released a double-character toy package featuring Jedi Mickey and Yoda as part of its Star Wars: Star Tours toy line in 2005. In 2007, Schoeneberg's team created Jedi Mickey's official lightsaber toy.\nThree years later, Disney Parks added R2-MK, Mickey's astromech droid sidekick, to its attraction, and subsequently released a double-character toy package that included the two characters together. The Jedi Mickey-R2-MK packaging provided specific details regarding Jedi Mickey's inclusion in the Star Wars galaxy. That same year, Star Wars creator George Lucas, posed alongside Jedi Mickey, R2-MK and other characters at Walt Disney World Resort to promote the \"Last Tour To Endor,\" a fan event that celebrated the last year of the original ride Star Tours before its upcoming replacement by Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.\nIn addition to the original character of Jedi Mickey, the mascot of the Walt Disney Company has also portrayed Luke Skywalker in various Star Wars/Disney crossover action figures. The series includes other Disney characters assuming Star Wars personæ, such as Minnie Mouse as Princess Leia Organa, Donald Duck as Han Solo, Goofy as C-3PO, and Black Pete as Boba Fett.\nIn 2008, a character key of Jedi Mickey was released by Acme Archives Direct, the official licensee for original and fine art for Disney, Star Wars and other franchises. That limited edition character key first mentioned Mouse's homeworld as \"Hyperion.\" In real-life, Hyperion is a small moon of the planet Saturn and the Burbank street where the Walt Disney Studios were located in the 20s and 30s when Mickey was first created. The character key also gave Jedi Mickey's size as 1.35 meters, but that information contradicts the appearance of the Hasbro toys. Additionally, he was explicitely described as small on the back of the \"Jedi Mickey \u0026 Yoda\" pack.\nOn April 1, 2012, the news website Live Geek or Die announced that Jedi Mickey would be a playable character in the upcoming action role-playing video game Diablo III published by Blizzard Entertainment. The article stated that Jedi Mickey would have upgradable force powers and the ability to summon his pet dog Pluto to assist him in a fight. However, this was later revealed to be a practical joke for April Fool's Day.\nWhile Hasbro's toy releases are generally included in canon, Holocron continuity database administrator Leland Chee, on May 24, 2012, confirmed via Twitter that Jedi Mickey and related toys were non-canon in the Holocron.",
