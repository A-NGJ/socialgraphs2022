She was a domineering social matriarch of an unknown noble house and she was said to run her manor like a stormtrooper. She was a great believer in finding something for the young noble of the house to do apart from party and enjoy themselves and was constantly trying to match up the young nobles in her charge with appropriate suitors.",
