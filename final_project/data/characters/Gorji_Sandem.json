 "content": "Gorji Sandem was a human male medic who served in the 224th Imperial Armored Division and was responsible for rescuing the wounded on the front. Courageous, he did not hesitate to get into the fray against the native Mimbanese to rescue the soldier Bokret Humphreys, who was badly wounded in the head. Like all the doctors of the 224th Division, Gorji Sandem was armed and did not hesitate to use his weapon against the enemies of the Empire, whose doctrine ordered military doctors to pay attention only to people of their own kind. Faced with the enemies of the Empire, the doctors behaved almost like classical soldiers.",
