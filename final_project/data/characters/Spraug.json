 "content": "Spraug was a Vratix low-scale criminal living on Nar Shaddaa during the Yuuzhan Vong War. He had in his possession a holocron with Yuuzhan Vong spies in the galaxy. Finn Galfridian tracked him down and confronted him with Leia Organa Solo, Jacen Solo, Jaina Solo, Anakin Solo, and Lowbacca. Spraug tried to flee the group but Lowbacca stopped him by kicking him. He then introduced himself and Leia made him sell his holocron for nowhere near what it was worth.\nSpraug was later seen in the company of Dahal and Dray. Dray sensed that Finn Galfridian was returning to Nar Shaddaa, and had Dahal and Spraug buy him new clothes.",
