 "content": "Kli-Klu Niib was a male Sullustan sabacc ringer working for the casino of the Sanads of Rorkee hotel.\nNiib had a datapad implanted on the back of his hand to perform arithmetical operations while gambling, and so take advantage of the probabilities. Although unusual, this was not illegal.\nNiib was known to be a serious person who disliked talking about himself.\nIn 31 BBY, Niib noticed a guest of the hotel, Dr. Shilaea Motacc, and decided she was a very nice person. Niib was both surprised and disappointed when Motacc apparently died in a supposed cave-in in the Dorumaa Excavation simulation â€” particularly as he believed accidents could not have happened there.",
