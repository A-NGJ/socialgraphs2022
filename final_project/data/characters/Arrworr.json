 "content": "Arrworr was a male Wookiee who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Arrworr was captured by a group of Trandoshan slavers of the Blackscale Clan led by the slavemaster Trussk. The Wookiee was shipped to a building owned by the Trandoshans in the city of Keren, on the planet Naboo. There, he was tortured for weeks. In 1 ABY, the building was attacked by a group of spacers. These adventurers were investigating the disappearance of a pilot known as Cal Handro who was wanted dead by the Blackscale Clan. The spacer killed most slavers, including the slavemaster Trussk, and eventually freed the Wookiee. After escaping the house, Arrworr revealed to the spacers that the missing pilot was tracked by the slavemaster for having smuggled slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan but had never been seen there.\nArrworr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Arrworr was added to the game with the third chapter of the \"Secrets of the Syren\" quest line, released with the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"Chapter 1\", published on June 8, 2006, due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the Battle of Restuss.",
