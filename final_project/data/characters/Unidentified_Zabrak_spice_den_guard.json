 "content": "A Zabrak worked as a guard at The Den, a spice production facility in Daiyu city. When Obi-Wan Kenobi infiltrated The Den in search of a kidnapped Leia Organa, he was confronted by the Zabrak and a human guard who queried about his presence. Kenobi fought the pair, who put up a fierce fight, but managed to subdue them. He then forced the human worker to reveal where the girl was being held.\nThe Zabrak appeared in the Obi-Wan Kenobi episode \"Part II,\" where he was played by Tom O'Connell, who also doubled as Darth Vader for the series' fight scenes. In the episode credits, the character is listed as \"Spice Den Guard #1.\"",
