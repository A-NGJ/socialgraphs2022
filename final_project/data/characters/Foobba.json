 "content": "Foobba was a male Mirialan who worked in the employ of the Hutt Cartel during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. He was stationed aboard Vaiken Spacedock.\nCorporal Foobba appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Nar Shaddaa Equipment Commendations Vendor on Carrick Station, though he was later relabeled as a Level 21 Equipment Vendor. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, he was removed from the game along with the rest of the Equipment Commendations Vendors. He was identical to Zanler, the Equipment Commendations Vendor that appeared on Nar Shaddaa.",
