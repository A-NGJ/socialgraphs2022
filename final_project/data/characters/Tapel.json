 "content": "Tapel was a Boosodian male who was an amateur archaeologist and a resident of Wyke Town on Loreth. After arriving on Loreth, Tapel discovered cave paintings within the mountain named Temple Peak of a creature known as a Gretalax, which the residents assumed were extinct. However, a Gretalax from Temple Peak later attacked Wyke Town, leading founder Layton Wyke to hire the monster hunter Ty Yorrick to deal with the creature. After Yorrick arrived, Wyke took her to meet Tapel and view the cave paintings.",
