 "content": "Ellor Koota was a male Duros who lived during the time of the Clone Wars.\nKoota lived in the city of Oluna Biqua on Genarius, where he was a vagrant. Along with the rest of the city's population, he was infected by the gas Trinex-M when it was released there. It drove him insane, making him have visions and giving him violent mood swings. He began wearing his clothes inside out and wore a plastic box on his head, which he hoped would block out the visions.",
