 "content": "Bree was the shortened nickname of a female Human who lived in Cloud City on the planet Bespin during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. She ran a cantina in the Port Town district of the city, known as the Four-and-a-Half, which was located illegally between levels in a utility space. None of her clientele knew Bree's full name, and she was considered slimy by many.\nBree first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire in 2014 by Fantasy Flight Games. She is listed as a character players might encounter, although no specific interaction is described.",
