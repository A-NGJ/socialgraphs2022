 "content": "Metrisse was a male Fondorian composer who was born before the year 38 BBY. At some point before that year, the composer temporarily resided in Poloda Place, an apartment complex on the Galactic Republic's capital planet of Coruscant. While Metrisse stayed at the complex, he composed the Ã‰tudes of Time and Space, a piece of music that was considered famous by 18 BBY. Around that year, while in Poloda Place, the Sullustan reporter Den Dhur thought about Metrisse and his composition when he recalled the number of artistic individuals who had stayed at the complex due to its low renting prices, large living areas, and perceived security.\nMetrisse was first mentioned in Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows, a 2008 novel written by Michael Reaves as the second installment in the Star Wars: Coruscant Nights trilogy.",
