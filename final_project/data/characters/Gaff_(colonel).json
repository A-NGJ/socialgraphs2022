 "content": "Gaff was a Human male colonel in the Republic Army who served as the local regimental commander of Republic forces on the planet Taris. He was ordered by General Garza to assist a Havoc Squad lieutenant with a mission, but was not told what the mission was. Because of that, Gaff was reluctant to help, though his subordinate Elara Dorne cited a Republic regulation that allowed her to assist Havoc Squad without his intervention.",
