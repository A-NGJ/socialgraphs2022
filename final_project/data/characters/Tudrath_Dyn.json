 "content": "Tudrath Dyn was a young Yuuzhan Vong warrior and student of Czulkang Lah's class on strategy. When members of the class could not answer one of Lah's questions on the Battle of Coruscant, he decided to give them all a Czulkang Lah pit. Tudrath Dyn correctly guessed the answer to Lah's question: They needed to know what the New Republic was willing to sacrifice, so that would know how they thought. Dyn was instructed to sit, and did not receive a pit from Lah's amphistaff.",
