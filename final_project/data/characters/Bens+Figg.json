 "content": "Bens Figg was an Imperial stormtrooper who, in 3 ABY, served in Lieutenant Mils Giel's expedition to investigate the formerly Rebel-held Golrath Station. Considered future officer material from his earliest days at the Imperial Academy, Figg graduated top of his class, while excelling athletically and also enjoying popularity with the female students. Figg was expected to become the youngest-ever member of the Emperor's Royal Guard after completing his rookie tour of duty on Golrath, where he and former Academy roommate Tabbins Vee were assigned to guard the station's reactor. However, none of that came to passâ€”Figg was surprised and incapacitated by Rebel saboteur Leia Organa while on duty, and was caught in the explosion when Organa destroyed the facility shortly afterward.",
