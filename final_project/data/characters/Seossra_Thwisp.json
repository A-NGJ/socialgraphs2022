 "content": "Seossra Thwisp was a Caphex female spy who served the Resistance. Keeping tabs on First Order activity along the borderlands, Thwisp was recalled into the Resistance after the Hosnian Cataclysm, and began serving as an intelligence analyst.\nShe returned to the field to fight in the Battle of Exegol with the rest of the Resistance. After they successfully defeated the forces of the First Order and Sith Eternal, Thwisp returned to the moon Ajan Kloss to celebrate the victory.\nSeossra Thwisp was a Caphex female from Caphexdis who served the Resistance as a spy during their Cold War with the First Order, keeping tabs on First Order activity along the borderlands. When full scale war broke out between the two factions following the Hosnian Cataclysm in 34 ABY, Thwisp was recalled from spy duty and began serving as an intelligence analyst, offering up her accumulated expertise on the First Order.\nIn 35 ABY, Thwisp was amongst the Resistance personnel stationed in the Resistance base on the jungle moon of Ajan Kloss. She attended a meeting at the base following the death of Resistance leader General Leia Organa, in which the new leader of the movement, General Poe Dameron, briefed those present on a plan to attack the First Order and Sith Eternal forces stationed on the Unknown Regions planet Exegol. Thwisp then returned to the field as part of the Resistance's forces that traveled to Exegol, where the Resistance ultimately triumphed in the battle after a large fleet of allies arrived to reinforce them. Following the battle, Thwisp returned with many others to Ajan Kloss to celebrate. During the celebration she stood talking with a human and then began cheering as the Wookiee Chewbacca and the pirate Maz Kanata reunited.\nSeossra Thwisp had pale skin, gray hair and black eyes.\nSeossra Thwisp wore a camouflage parka with a brown belt and used a vintage DH-17 blaster rifle.\nSeossra Thwisp first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. Concept art of Thwisp titled \"Wizard 71\" was drawn by creature concept artist and senior sculptor Luke Fisher. The art depicted several Caphex, all much squatter and more hunch-backed then Thwisp's final appearance in the film.",
