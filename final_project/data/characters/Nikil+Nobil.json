 "content": "Nikil Nobil was a male Thisspiasian Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order as a member of the Jedi High Council during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, Nobil spoke with Grand Master Satele Shan and her Padawan Shigar Konshi via holoprojector in order to convey the Council's decision that Konshi was unfit to undertake the Jedi Trials. When questioned as to why, Nobil lectured Konshi on his lack of self-control, citing his recent comments to Senator Vuub as an example.\nNikil Nobil was mentioned in the 2010 novel The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance, written by Sean Williams as a tie-in to the then-upcoming 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic by BioWare. Like many of the characters from the novel, which was written early in the game's development, Nobil has not been referenced in any other part of the game's multimedia project.",
