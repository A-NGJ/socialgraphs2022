 "content": "A Human male Jedi Master was murdered by his apprentice.\nAn individual began training in the Jedi Order during infancy as with all Jedi of the era. Studying at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, this Jedi eventually passed the Jedi Trials and was knighted by the Jedi High Council. Further pursuits of knowledge of the Force and lightsaber skill earned this individual the rank of Master. It was at this point in life that this individual spotted an initiate and took him as a Padawan.\nThe Jedi Master trained his Padawan to Knighthood, but eventually the Knight tried to learn about the dark side. He believed that he could learn its secrets while remaining true to the light side, yet he fell under the dark side's seductive power. After having an argument with his Master, he gave into his anger and killed his master. His story was later featured in a Sith holocron.\nIn 3997 BBY, during the Great Sith War, Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma decided to infiltrate a dark side cult known as the Krath and dismantle it from within. Jedi Master Odan-Urr decided to warn Qel-Droma about the dangers of the dark side by showing him the story of the Dark Jedi in the Sith holocron. Stunned by the images he saw, Qel-Droma lashed out at Bnar and Odan-Urr, and proclaimed that they would rather do nothing than try to defeat the dark side.",
