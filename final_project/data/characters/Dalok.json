 "content": "Dalok was a male Abyssin teenager who was one of the Orsis Academy's top students. When a young Maul first arrived on Orsis, he chose to fight Dalok as his orders per a disguised Darth Sidious were to challenge the biggest, most muscular student there. After getting battered around by the Abyssin's brute strength, Maul feigned deliriousness and took advantage of Dalok's confusion, brutally knocking him unconscious, and gained the respect and fear of all those present.",
