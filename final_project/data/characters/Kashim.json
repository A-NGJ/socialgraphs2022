 "content": "Kashim was a male Duros who served as general in the Republic Armed Forces and was in command of all Republic forces on the Core World of Alderaan during the Cold War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. Working with Duke Charle of House Organa, Kashim and his troops aided House Organa in the war for the throne. In 3643 BBY, Organa and Kashim were aided by a Republic-allied individual in their fight against the Imperial-allied House Thul.\nA male Duros, Kashim joined the Republic Military and rose to the rank of general during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, he was stationed on the Core World of Alderaan, which was in the middle of a brutal civil war over which house would take the throne. He worked closely with the head of the Republic-allied House Organa, Duke Charle Remmot Organa, in the fight against the Imperial-allied House Thul and the independent House Ulgo.\nIn 3643 BBY, Thul forces seized control of the Apalis Coast and the Organa Vinerium. They also pushed towards Castle Organa's generators, using baradium bombs in a scorched-earth tactic. Kashim learned of a Republic-allied individual's arrival on the planet, and employed Haley Organa to contact the individual at Pallista Spaceport. Via holotransmission, Kashim asked the individual to stop the attacks and defuse four baradium explosives.\nWhen the individual succeeded, they met with Kashim and Duke Organa in Organa Palace. Noting the individual's skills, Kashim and Organa asked the individual to drive back the Thul forces attacking the Spears of Organa—a trio of ancient defensive turrets built into the bedrock of the surrounding mountains. Pushing back the enemy, the operative succeeded in securing Spears Cresh, Osk, and Trill, ensuring that they could not be used by House Thul against House Organa or the Republic.\nUnfortunately, when the individual returned, Jharkus Thul—the so-called Wolf Baron and leader of the Thul army—contacted the Duke and revealed that the attack on the Spears had been a diversion. While the Organa forces had been occupied with defending the Spears, Thul's forces had captured three hundred and forty-eight Organa citizens. When Duke Organa demanded their release, the Wolf Baron asked that Organa meet him in the Organa Vinerium to negotiate. Suspecting a trap, the individual offered to clear out the meeting place before the Duke came while Kashim massed the Organa troops.\nThe individual ended up taking the hostages' place as the Wolf Baron's captive, as Thul believed that without the operative's assistance House Organa would easily fall. As soon as the captives were returned, Kashim organized a mssion to rescue the hero. The Duros sent Brant Sonn and several other former captives to free the individual, and then informed the freed prisoner that the Thul forces. The Organas were desperately in need of reinforcements, as the Empire had sent several Sith apprentices to aid House Thul. If the individual could not take out the apprentices, House Organa would be forced to flee and go into exile. The individual succeeded, however, killing the apprentices and driving back the Thul forces from the Vinerium. Thanks to the operative's efforts, the Republic and Organa forces were able to gain the upper hand and drive the Imperial and Thul armies completely from the Apalis Coast and secure the area around the Organa estate.\nKashim and the Duke would later have contact with the individual again when Science Commander Keikana Herot reported to them via holocomm. The individual had aided Herot in halting a recent string of Killik attacks in the Alsakan Lowlands by destroying House Ulgo's \"pain factory\" that had been torturing Killiks to provoke them.\nKashim was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears on the planet Alderaan, as part of the main series of bonus quests for Republic players. He and Duke Charle Organa enlist the player's help in battling the forces of House Thul and the Empire across the Apalis Coast.",
