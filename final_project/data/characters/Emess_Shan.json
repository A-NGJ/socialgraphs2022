 "content": "Emess Shan was a female Human who was the wife of Vaner Shan, the son of the renowned Jedi Knights Revan and Bastila Shan. Emess was younger than Vaner, who had been born in 3954 BBY, and Vaner's mother initially disapproved of their relationship on account of her age. By 3900 BBY, Emess had a son named Bress and a younger daughter named Reesa, both of whom were Force-sensitive, and her husband was running for Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. On the anniversary of Bastila's marriage to Revan, Emess and her children accompanied Vaner when he visited his mother, and Emess put her children to bed at the end of the day while Vaner spoke with Bastila.\nEmess Shan was first mentioned in the epilogue of Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan, which was released on November 15, 2011. The introduction of Emess and Vaner's marriage and children confirmed that the Shan family continued beyond Bastila's son.",
