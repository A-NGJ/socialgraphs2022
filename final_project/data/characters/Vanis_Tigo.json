 "content": "Vanis Tigo was a human male who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire. In 5 BBY, Tigo was put in charge of the new Imperial garrison on the planet Ferrix. Upon arriving on Ferrix to take his new assignment, he asked Imperial Security Bureau Supervisor Blevin whether he could bear the title of Prefect, to which Blevin answered dismissively despite Tigo ultimately getting the rank.\nSeveral weeks into the occupation of Ferrix, under the orders of Supervisor Dedra Meero who had begun a hunt for the criminal Cassian Andor, Tigo's troops arrested Salman Paak, a friend of Andor's. When a crowd gathered around the Repaak Salyard, Tigo recognized Bix Caleen in the crowd and ordered for her to be seized, leading to a chase as she attempted to flee to Zorby's Western Shiplot. However, the Imperial forces caught up to Caleen, and she was taken into the former hotel that served as the garrison headquarters to be tortured for information.\nDuring the reign of the Galactic Empire, the human male Vanis Tigo served as an Imperial officer with the rank of captain. In 5 BBY, the Empire took over jurisdiction of the Morlani system from the local Corporate Authority as a result of an incident where the corpos failed to serve a warrant on the orbiting planet Ferrix, which led to multiple deaths. Tigo was was placed in command of the new garrison as the Empire begun establishing its presence there. The operations were managed in part by Lieutenant Supervisor Blevin from the Imperial Security Bureau, who supervised Ferrix's sector, the Free Trade sector.\nThe Empire seized a hotel in Ferrix's local town. Tigo oversaw the clearing out of the hotel before he was hailed by the nearby Blevin, who asked him if he wanted the hotel. The captain confusingly thought the supervisor meant the assignment to Ferrix, which he already had, but the ISB officer clarified that he meant Tigo having the hotel as a headquarters. Tigo then asked if he could be given the title of Prefect. Blevin was unconcerned with such matters and simply wanted the captain to get Imperial operations up and running on Ferrix by the time of his next staff meeting.\nTigo ultimately received his promotion to Prefect. In the meantime, the supervision of the Free Trade sector was taken off of Blevin and given to Lieutenant Supervisor Dedra Meero, who wished to pursue her suspicions that the incident on Ferrix was related to rebel activity. One night, a radio transmission was tracked to a fractal radio unit used at the Repaak Salyard, owned by the proprietor Salman Paak. Paak was taken into the hotel and tortured overnight by Doctor Gorst, in which the subject admitted to keeping the radio as a point of contact between the mechanic Bix Caleen and an unidentified contact, in reality the rebel coordinator Luthen Rael.\nWith Caleen identified to him Tigo consulted the Repaak Salyard with Lieutenant Keysax. Wilmon Paak, Salman's son, demanded to know where his father was, only to be restrained as the captain exited the establishment with Keysax, ordering for the boy to be silenced. Tigo had the guarding stormtroopers form a perimeter to move back the many watching residents. That was when he noticed Caleen in the audience, taking a datapad from one of his lieutenants to confirm his suspicions. The captain called out to Caleen, leading to the suspect fleeting for Zorby's Western Shiplot. Tigo ordered for the mechanic to be captured, Keysax and his men making pursuit.\nCaleen was apprehended and taken back to the hotel, where Meero awaited with Gorst and the traumatised Salman. Tigo informed the supervisor of their suspect's imminent arrival and was advised to allow Caleen to see Salman in his frail state as she arrived. Keysax and his men then arrived with the mechanic, Meero pretending that the proprietor's presence was a mistake and ordering Tigo to have him taken away. Caleen was then tortured by Gorst and gave up information on \"the buyer,\" Rael, and Cassian Andor, a Ferrix resident and thief who had fled with Rael.\nFollowing the interrogation, Meero ordered Tigo to keep her alive as she was still an asset to them. The captain questioned what was to happen to Salman, the supervisor not caring what would happen to the proprietor. He resultantly revealed his intent in hanging the prisoner as a power assertion over the Ferrix residents.\nAt a later point, Tigo was in a briefing alongside Keysax, Meero, and her ISB Attendant Corv.\nTigo wore a black Imperial officer's uniform with a black Imperial kepi, two code cylinders in the right pocket and a rank insignia plaque with three blue tiles. However, he later wore a rank insignia plaque with four blue tiles while wearing a waterproof cover over his uniform.\nVanis Tigo first appeared in \"The Axe Forgets,\" the fifth episode of the Disney+ live-action series Andor, The character was portrayed by Wilf Scolding and footage of him was first shown in the first official trailer for the series on August 1 of that year. He was first identified in an image asset release on Getty Images by Walt Disney Studios.",
