 "content": "Maximilian Vox was a male Human officer of the Galactic Empire who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime after 0 BBY, Lieutenant Maximilian Vox was the immediate superior of Commander Arlan Barrezz and was based out of Kaadara on Naboo. In 1 ABY, he worked with a spacer who had previously worked with Commander Barrezz on Tatooine. Vox tasked the operative with retrieving several droid modules dating back to the time of the Old Republic. The objective of Vox was to recreate a powerful droid artificial intelligence technology that was lost over the years. In the meantime, the droid modules were also wanted by the operatives of the Rebel Agent Wilson Tchorshel. The spacer found the positional awareness triangulator chip in a mouse droid used by the Skaak Tippers in their hideout. The decentralized autonomy chip was given by the Hutt crime lord Borvo after the spacer managed to compromise the security of Borvo's Vault. The spacer recovered the strategy/tactics simulation chip after destroying a droideka in the Stonewall Labs headquarters, thanks to the assistance of Professor Zanier Hudmasse. Finally, the spacer retrieved the stochastic decision chip with the help of Boss Nass by destroying a super battle droid in possession of the Ultragungan Militia. The operative was successful and was then awarded the Medal of the Emperor's Fist by Maximilian Vox. With the four modules reunited, Vox quickly left Naboo in order to transfer the AI modules to Imperial scientists and droid engineers.\nMaximilian Vox appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Maximilian Vox was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
