 "content": "Qui-Ko was a male Human Je'daii Master and seer serving the Je'daii Order on Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire's reign.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Qui-Ko was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Ascending to the rank of Je'daii Master, Qui-Ko wrote many texts based on his study of the Ashla and his own visions of the future. Following the Force Wars and the death of the Je'daii Order, Qui-Ko's teachings and manuscripts were preserved by members of the fledgling Jedi Order, eventually making their way into the Archives of the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Safely housed in the Temple, these text were analyzed by generations of Jedi Knights reflecting on the origins of the Order, and the earliest teachings of the Force.\nQui-Ko was first mentioned in The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a 2010 reference book by Daniel Wallace. In the endnotes for The Jedi Path published at his blog, Wallace suggested that Qui-Gon Jinn could have been named after Qui-Ko.",
