 "content": "Sadelli was an enslaved female Twi'lek and the older sister of Soolami who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Sadelli was a slave under Trandoshan slavemaster Woff B'tar. Just before being shipped off to Nal Hutta, Sadelli escaped, but still remained in great danger. Fortunately for her, waitress JillJoo Jab dispatched a spacer to find her and bring her back to Mos Espa, so that she could be safely transported off Tatooine.\nWhile the spacer did succeed in escorting her, she would not leave the planet without her younger sister Soolami, who remained in captivity. JillJoo once again dispatched the spacer, this time to rescue Soolami, so that both siblings could leave the planet.\nSadelli is Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Players who perform a series of quests for JillJoo Jab in Mos Espa must find Sadelli and bring her back to the city safely.",
