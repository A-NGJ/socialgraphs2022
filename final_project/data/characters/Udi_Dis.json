 "content": "Udi Dis was a Talortai male who served the Nihil marauder organization. Having left his home of Talor, Dis had once been a soldier, carrying wingblades that were his only possession from his home. As a Talortai, Dis possessed an affinity to the Force that allowed him to navigate the galaxy with precision, utilizing his ability as a navigator for the Nihil.\nDis, a former reedug addict, had served the Cloud Scarspike for several years. After an attack that failed due to Scarspike's poor planning, Dis killed the Cloud. The Talortai was subsequently elevated by Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro into the Nihil leader's personal retinue, accompanying Ro on a mission to the planet Rystan. However, Ro had only wanted Dis's presence in order to test the effects of the Great Leveler, a creature frozen in ice that he wished to collect from Rystan, on a Force-sensitive. Arriving at the Leveler's location in the Shrine, Dis was overwhelmed by its power, losing his connection to the Force. After Dis was stabbed through the chest by one of the Shrine's droid guardians, Ro thanked him for serving his purpose well before bringing his foot down onto Dis's head, leaving the Talortai dead.",
