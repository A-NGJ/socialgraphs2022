 "content": "Garblaque was a Hutt businessman who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nAround 3650 BBY, Garblaque retired to a moon of the planet Hosko, and was considered to have rather laid-back tastes for a Hutt. He was terrified of conflict, and so when the Galactic War erupted, he bankrupted himself building a luxury dreadnaught named the Haven. In order to pay for the ship, he began auctioning off thousands of tickets to the ship, which would embark on a ten-year pleasure cruise in order to wait out the galactic conflict.\nAround the same time, an admiral hinted that he would like to possess the gold-plated astromech droid owned by Garblaque the Hutt and hired an individual to sort out an arrangement.",
