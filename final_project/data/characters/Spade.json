 "content": "Spade was an Advanced Recon Commando and one of a group of clone troopers left behind on Pengalan IV after their LAAT/i was shot down during a full scale Republic retreat.\nAbandoned with his fellow troopers and a Republic accountant named Joram Kithe, they were on their own to figure out how to get off the desert planet. When Kithe awoke and revealed that he had been commissioned as a Republic Intelligence lieutenant, Spade was the one of the first troopers to speak to him.\nKithe was disturbed by the troopers' reliance on proper procedure, and tried to foster individuality in them. To that end, he gave the troopers nicknames. Spade gained his nickname because he was digging graves for the gunship's dead and leaning on his shovel the first time Kithe spoke to him.\nAfter making their way to Tur Lorkin, the nearest village, and infiltrating a starship bay, Tooth and Kithe realized that the village was in fact the site of the diamond boron missile manufacturing facility, not the factory which had been the site of the earlier trap.\nDetermined to destroy it, Tooth faced Kithe and was willing to defy the man's orders to complete his mission. Impressed, Kithe relented. The troopers sabotaged the factory with Kithe's aid while Tooth stole a Corellian ship to draw the CIS fighters away from the starship bay, allowing Kithe and the remaining troopers to escape. Spade took point in the assault on the factory. He did not survive the fighting on the way out.",
