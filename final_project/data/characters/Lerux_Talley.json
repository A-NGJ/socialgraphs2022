 "content": "Lerux Talley was a diminutive male human who worked as a tinkerer at Unkar Plutt's washing tables at the Niima Bazaar, on the planet Jakku. Although he claimed to be from the Core Worlds, the scavenger Rey, who was fond of him, suspected it was not true. Around the time of the Escape from Jakku, Rey wrote about him in her survival guide book.\nAt one point on Jakku, Rey gained information from Talley about a job that the Junk boss Plutt was offeringâ€”rations in exchange for scavenging a quadjumper out in the western desert.\nLerux Talley was first mentioned in the book Rey's Survival Guide.",
