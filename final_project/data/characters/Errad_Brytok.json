 "content": "Errad Brytok was a Human male lieutenant in the Imperial Navy, and a Sergeant Major during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, he was second in command to Captain Gilad Pellaeon, aboard the Chimaera.\nErrad Brytok was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Brytok  revealed him to also be a Sergeant Major. As Errad Brytok was repeatedly identified as a lieutenant of the Imperial Navy, this additional rank of sergeant major displayed in the examination window was likely a result of game mechanics, and may or may not be canon. It may not have been impossible, however, for Errad Brytok to have held the additional rank of sergeant major in another branch of the Military, such as the Imperial Army.",
