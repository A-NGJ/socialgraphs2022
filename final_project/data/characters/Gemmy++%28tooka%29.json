 "content": "Gemmy was a tooka cat who lived in the Dalna Jedi temple on the planet Dalna as a pet.\nGemmy took a liking to Imri Cantaros after it jumped in his lap and the boy fed him some cheese. When Cantaros and his companions were meeting the vice-president of Dalna, Gemmy jumped onto Cantaros' shoulder. Yacek Sparkburn recommended they allow it to come along, so Cantaros scratched its head, it responding with a growly sound. Cantaros thought that he was grateful for the tooka. However, as they reached Saludad, Gemmy jumped off Cantaros' shoulder to chase a furry puffball creature.\nGemmy first appeared in the novel The High Republic: Mission to Disaster published on January 4, 2022, written by Justina Ireland.",
