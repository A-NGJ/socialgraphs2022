 "content": "This clone trooper pilot used the callsign \"Red Leader\" served in the Battle of Muunilinst. He was commander of Red Squadron.\nAs a massive space battle raged above Muunilinst, along with Commander Anakin Skywalker Red Leader lead a squad of V-19 Torrent starfighters during the huge space battle. As Anakin is pursued by yet more enemy fighters, he ordered Red Leader to have his squadron fire all their concussion missiles across the bow of Cruiser 8. Though the clone pilots were baffled by the order they were obliged to obey. He flew past the ship as the missiles started arriving; the missiles hit the swarm of fighters pursuing him, destroying a large number of them. Trailed by missiles, Skywalker flew through the hangar of one of the gun platforms. The missiles collided with various objects within the hangar and destroyed the gun platform from the inside.",
