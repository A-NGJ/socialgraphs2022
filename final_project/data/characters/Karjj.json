 "content": "Karjj was a Crocin male who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire, and could play the card game sabacc. He was present during Lando Calrissian and Han Solo's first sabacc game.\nKarjj was a Crocin male who in 10 BBY was in large amounts of debt and a troubled marriage. This put him in a foul-tempered and distracted state that made him a welcome addition to a sabacc game being played in one of the back rooms of the Lodge, a saloon located in Fort Ypso on the planet Vandor. He sat between the dealer, Saucer Head, and the Nephran Therm Scissorpunch, with other players including the humans Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. The table played the Corellian Spike variant of sabacc and at one point, Karjj became so infuriated that he placed his hand of cards between his jaws and gnawed them into confetti. He later left the table and his seat was taken by another human player.\nKarjj was mentioned and illustrated in an artist's journal, which was restored, expanded, and displayed by the Graf Archive at some point after 34 ABY.\nKarjj was an unlucky individual, which left him in a foul tempered and distracted state that meant he could be counted on to lose his money as quickly as he lost his temper. Despite his frequent losses, Karjj maintained his love of the game. He had brown skin and yellow eyes. He spoke Croci.\nWhile at the Lodge, Karjj wore a brown fur-lined coat with a brown belt, black shirt, black pants, a brown scarf, and a pair of goggles. He also wore an oiled brown headwrap that kept his scales from drying out. He owned a starship that was considered a clunker.\nKarjj was designed by Jake Lunt Davies and portrayed by Kiran Shah in the Star Wars Anthology Series film Solo: A Star Wars Story. The character was revealed in a Solo-themed Denny's commercial released on April 2, 2018.",
