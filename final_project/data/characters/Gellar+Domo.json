 "content": "Gellar Domo was a male Human, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDomo was a member of the Intarsa League, a criminal organization that operated in the Cularin system. He worked his way up through the organization by working as an enforcer and a \"hard man\" for it. When Dersa Welles became leader of the League, Domo followed her, as he believed that she was a strong leader. When the League captured the Blue Star Centre, on Cularin, in around 31 BBY, Domo took up a defensive position in one of the Centre's office buildings.",
