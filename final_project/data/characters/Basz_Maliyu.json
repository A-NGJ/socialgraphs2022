 "content": "Basz Maliyu was a Mon Calamari smuggler.\nBasz Maliyu was known for his ease around Imperial officers, which spawned a number of stories and suspicions. Some believed him to have once been an Imperial slave, while others believed he befriended Imperial officers to avoid undesirable customs difficulties on his smuggling runs. These suspicions caused many to believe that Maliyu informed the Empire of Syvris shadowport's location. Following its destruction, he was shunned by the smuggler and fringer community.\nBasz Maliyu was the first Mon Calamari character to be given two names, predating the introduction of Jesmin Ackbar by several months. Previously, Mon Calamari were generally assumed by fans to not have family names.",
