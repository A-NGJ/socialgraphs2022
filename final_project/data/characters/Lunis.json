 "content": "Lunis was a male Weequay Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Before the war erupted, Master Lunis selected Obs Kaj as his Padawan.\nA Force-sensitive Weequay raised outside of the traditions of his home Sriluur, Lunis was not obsessed with the deity known as the Quay like many of his people. Educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, Lunis eventually attained the rank of Jedi Master. Selecting the young Falleen Initiate Obs Kaj as his Padawan, the pair joined the Grand Army of the Republic when the Republic went to war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nServing as a General, Master Lunis was dispatched with his Padawan to investigate rumored illegal cloning on the planet Katanos VII. The horrors of the Clone Wars had affected the Master-Padawan pairing, causing Lunis to fear the growing distance developing between them. Before making planetfall, Lunis took Kaj aside and reminded her that he did care about her and hoped that they could reconnect through the Force. Meeting with Stiv Kram on the planet, Lunis inquired about the rumored cloning facility and was met with denial.\nHowever, after doing some investigatory work, Kaj discovered a massive cloning facility filled with failed experiments. Through further interrogation of Kram, Master Lunis learned that the citizens of the world built the facility as a means of providing something of value to the Republic but had only been met with failure. Seizing the opportunity, Kram decided to capture the Jedi and turn them over to the Confederacy in order to collect a bounty on all Jedi. As the miners of the world attacked Lunis, the Weequay attempted to form a mental link with his Padawan in order to bolster his reaction. However, Kaj was more disillusioned with the Order after their betrayal by the miners and resisted her master. Alone amidst countless adversaries, Master Lunis was quickly slain by the miners.",
