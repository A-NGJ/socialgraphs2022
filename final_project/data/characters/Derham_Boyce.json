 "content": "Derham Boyce was a human male who served as sergeant in the ground forces of the Resistance during their war against the First Order. During the attack on the Resistance fleet by the First Order following the evacuation from the planet D'Qar in the year 34 ABY, Boyce was redeployed as a bridge guard on board the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus in order to provide extra shipboard security. The sergeant wore a brown military uniform including a combat helmet, a weatherproof field jacket, pants, boots and an RM-45 ammunition and tool pouch. He carried a EL-16 blaster rifle rifle.\nDerham Boyce first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. The character was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
