 "content": "Meena Tills, a Mon Calamari female, was the Galactic Republic senator from Mon Cala. She served with Tundra Dowmeia as Mon Cala's delegate to the Galactic Senate. By the end of the Clone Wars, Tills was part of the Delegation of 2,000 and signed the Petition of 2,000.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tills represented Mon Cala in the Galactic Senate.\nWhen Mon Cala was engulfed into war with the Mon Calamari being supported by the Republic, but with the Quarren backed by the Separatists, the king of Mon Cala was murdered, leading it to be uncertain who would succeed him. When Lee-Char, the Prince of Mon Cala, stepped forward, he was met with a revolution as the Quarren and the Separatists launched a full siege. Tills traveled back from the Senate with Padm√© Amidala, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to inspect the situation. When Amidala informed the Senate that the situation had become a full scale civil war, the Republic sent aide and thousands of troops in the form of a company of clone SCUBA troopers and eventually, the Gungan Grand Army. However, the situation worsened and Tills, along with Char's few remaining loyal followers, were captured and imprisoned. However when the Separatist army was defeated and Lee-Char was seen as the true ruler, Tills attended his coronation and looked heavily pleased at Mon Cala's return to diplomacy.\nShe was later present in the Galactic Senate when Rush Clovis announced that interest rates on the Republic would be raised by the Banking Clan because the Separatists were refusing to pay their loans. She expressed her concerns along with Senators Mot-Not Rab and Kin Robb. When Senator Robb called for a counter-invasion in order to seize the banks, Tills supported her.\nWhen the war came to an end, Tills joined the Delegation of 2,000, a group of Senators concerned with the power of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and she attended one of the final meetings with Palpatine before the Galactic Empire was formed. As a member of the Delegation, she signed the Petition of 2,000 which formally requested Palpatine give up his emergency powers at the war's conclusion.\nMeena Tills first appeared in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Tills was named after Tina Mills, former Lucasfilm image archivist.\nIn Episode III, the performer under Tills' guise was a man, causing action figure packaging and Legends storytelling to claim that Tills was male. When it was decided that Tills would appear in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, it was agreed that Tills would be female to match her namesake.",
