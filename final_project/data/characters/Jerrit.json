 "content": "Jerrit was a male Mon Calamari from Dac and an officer of the Republic Navy. Following the surprise assaults against the Galactic Republic by Mandalorian forces in 3963 BBY, Jerrit was promoted to the rank of lieutenant for his heroic efforts.\nJerrit was a native of Mon Calamari, an ocean-covered planet located in the Calamari sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The Mon Calamari served the Galactic Republic as an officer in the Republic Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. This war between the Republic and the resurgent forces of the Mandalorians began in the Outer Rim, where the Mandalorians made a three-pronged assault against the Republic in 3963 BBY. In the aftermath of this assault, known by the Republic media as the \"Onslaught,\" Jerrit received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant for his heroic efforts during the fighting. His promotion, reported in the Jimas Veltraa Memorial Edition of The Admiral's List, an official publication of the Republic Navy, occurred alongside that of notable officer Saul Karath to Rear Admiral.\nJerrit was a courageous soldier, and consequently recognized by the Republic Navy for his heroic efforts during the Onslaught.\nJerrit was created by John Jackson Miller, the author of the Knights of the Old Republic comics, and was mentioned in The Admiral's List: Jimas Veltraa Memorial Edition, appended to Knights of the Old Republic 13. This in-universe news source is designed as \"an official communique for the Republic providing news from the 'regular navy' point of view,\" inspired by the \"Napoleonic-era Britain's Naval Chronicle.\" Some of the promotions presented here are said to be confirmations of ones received on the battlefield, but it is not specified which these are or which are regular promotions.\nIn the original source, Jerrit was not given either a species or gender; however, a subsequent entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia specified both.",
