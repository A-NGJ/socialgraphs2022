 "content": "A Belugan guard lived on the planet Quarzite and worked for the Belugan leader, Lord Otua Blank, during the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, this Belugan, along with five other guards accompanied Lord Otua Blank at a meeting with a team of bounty hunters who were supposed to bring him his future wife, kidnapped Kage female, Pluma Sodi. When the subtram which carried her arrived, only one bounty hunter was apparently left guarding her, former Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress. Ventress then told Blank that she would give him the cargo containing Pluma only after he had paid up. Moments later, this guard approached Ventress, giving her the credits and receiving the chest from her. After this guard partially opened the chest, the bounty hunter Boba Fett kicked the lid up as far as it would go, revealing himself to have been locked in the chest, much to the surprise of the guards as well as the disgust of Otua Blank.",
