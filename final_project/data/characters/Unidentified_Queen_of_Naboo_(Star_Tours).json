 "content": "A Human female was appointed the new Queen of Naboo in the year 1 BBY. Her recent election was mentioned in a commercial released by the Star Tours travel agency to advertise its trips to the planet Naboo. The holographic advertisement contained footage of Gungan officials parading toward the steps of the Theed Royal Palace, where the Queen stood with other dignitaries. That ceremonial march in honor of the new Queen was very reminiscent of the one that followed the victory of the united Nabooian Humans and Gungans against the Trade Federation in 32 BBY.\nThe election of a Nabooian monarch is qualified as \"recent\" in a fake advertisement shown in the queue of the ride simulator attraction Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. The commercial reuses footage of the triumph parade featured at the end of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. However, the selected images either show the characters from a distance or with their back turned so they cannot be identified as the protagonists of The Phantom Menace.\nAccording to the StarWars.com article \"Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours,\" the events of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue occurred in 1 BBY. However, the defunct Star Wars-themed massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies had already established Queen Kylantha as the reigning monarch in that time period.",
