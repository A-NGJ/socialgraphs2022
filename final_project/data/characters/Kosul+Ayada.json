 "content": "Kosul Ayada was a male Herglic Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic faithfully for many years, dying several decades before the outbreak of the Clone Wars and the eventual rise of the Galactic Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Herglic, Kosul Ayada was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. A noted Jedi, Ayada took many Padawans during his career and successfully trained them to knighthood. His last student was a Zabrak boy named Eeth Koth, who went on to train as a Guardian of the Order and earn a seat on the Jedi High Council. When Ayada became one with the Force, Koth constructed a lightsaber hilt that resembled the Herglic's own as a way of memorializing his master.",
