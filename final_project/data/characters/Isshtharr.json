 "content": "Isshthar was a short-tempered Wookiee who nearly ripped off the arm of Sarliss because they disagreed about something. When Isshtharr was not using violence to solve problems, he asked his peers to find out how things worked. Unfortunately for him, not many could understand what he was saying. Isshthar was enslaved before he joined the Rebellion, and was saved from the mines on Kirtania by Ran Niall. When suspicion arises on Resolute Base, Var Narek puts Isshtharr up as a suspect to drive attention away from him.",
