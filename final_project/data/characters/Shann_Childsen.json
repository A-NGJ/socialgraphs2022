 "content": "Shann Childsen was a male human who served as a lieutenant in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire's army during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Childsen was stationed onboard the Death Star battle station, where he worked in Detention Block AA-23. The Lieutenant was shot by the Jedi Luke Skywalker when he and the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca arrived in Block AA-23 to rescue Princess Leia Organa.\nThe male human Shann Childsen served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire's army during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the war, he held the rank of lieutenant and was stationed on board the Death Star, a battle station with the capability to destroy planets. Childsen worked on the station's fifth level in Detention Block AA-23, where prisoners including Princess Leia Organa were kept in cells.\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, a group arrived on the Death Star hoping to rescue Organa. Two of the group, the Jedi Luke Skywalker and the smuggler Han Solo disguised themselves as stormtroopers and made their way to Block AA-23 with the Wookiee Chewbacca. As the trio arrived in a turbolift, Childsen questioned the troopers on what they were doing with the Wookiee. The two disguised rescuers attempted to fool Childsen, claiming that they were transferring Chewbacca from Cell Block 1138. Not having been informed of any transfers, Childsen signaled for two Imperial troopers with him to drawn their weapons and then attempted to check the Stormtroopers' claim. Solo and Skywalker, realizing their bluff had failed, opened fire on the Imperials. In the ensuing fight the aspiring Jedi shot and killed Childsen. The rescuers then managed to successfully free Organa and escape the Death Star.\nChildsen was a fair-skinned human with brown hair and blue eyes. He referred to the Wookiee Chewbacca as a \"thing\" upon seeing the non-human.\nChildsen wore a black Imperial uniform including a cap and carried a DH-17 blaster pistol.\nChildsen was portrayed uncredited by Malcolm Tierney in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The character was first named as Shann Childsen in Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game on a card in the A New Hope Limited set released in 1996. The set was established to be part of the Star Wars Legends continuity however, and so not a part of official Star Wars canon. His given name Shann was canonized in 2016, in Star Wars Insider 170.",
