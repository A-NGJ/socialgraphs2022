 "content": "Balawan was a male Imperial officer stationed on Victory Base on the planet Halmad during the First Galactic Civil War. As the Imperial pilots pushed into the base, Garik Loran used Balawan as an excuse to explain the presence of a bag. He did this by asserting that Balawan had allowed him to carry the bag, which the superior accepted, as he also had no high opinion of Balawan.",
