 "content": "Cohbo'rik'ardok, known by the core name Borika, formerly known as Irizi'rik'ardok, and born Kivu'rik'ardok, was a Chiss female who was the sister of Kivu'raw'nuru, later known as Mitth'raw'nuruodo, and a member of the Cohbo family.\nBorika was born no earlier than 61 BBY.At the age of five, the Chiss was determined to be suitable to become a sky-walker, a navigator for the Chiss Ascendancy. She was taken from her parents, with her brother assuming that she had died.\nAfter loosing her Third Sight, she was adopted by the Irizi family. She later married Bomarmo and joined the Cohbo family. Around the end of the Clone Wars, she was living with her husband on Ool and co-owned the Ardok Ranch with him.\nAfter his adoption into the Mitth family and reaching bridge officer rank in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, Thrawn was informed of the sky-walkers and their nature for the first time, realizing what had happened to his sister. He wished that he could see his sister again, but believed that, similar to most sky-walkers, she had sought to disappear into obscurity after her service. Thrawn later told the story of his sister to the former sky-walker Mitth'ali'astov, who suggested that he consult official recordsâ€”an idea that Thrawn denied, following the Ascendancy's practice of honoring former sky-walkers' wishes.\nCohbo'riki'ardok was first mentioned, albeit not by name, in the 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, written by Timothy Zahn. She made her first full appearance in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, also written by Zahn.",
