 "content": "Technical Lieutenant Makkor von Urron was a Human male technician and pilot of the Imperial Navy's 181st Imperial Fighter Group. Makkor von Urron was a TIE ace, racking up eleven kills against Rebel BTL Y-wing starfighters around Oovri II. However, an injury to his knee in the engagement took him out of service. Makkor reinvented himself as a technician working under Technical Services Officer Brandei of the Executor, who had handpicked him to lead the fifty-four repair techs serving Baron Soontir Fel's unit, the 181st. However, Fel convinced him to fly again in his unit.",
