 "content": "Lanos was a male Human citizen of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. By 3630 BBY, he was considered the Eternal Empire's most decorated war veteran and was also known as the gladiator in the Arena Grand of Zakuul under the title \"Supreme Vindicator\". That year, Lanos was put up against a newcomer known as \"the Mysterious Stranger\". During the fight in the Arena, he was assisted by his reprogrammed Skytroopers, but was defeated in the fifth round of the Arena fights.\nLanos appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as the fifth boss of \"Eternal Championship.\"",
