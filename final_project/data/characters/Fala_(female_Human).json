 "content": "Fala was a Force-sensitive Human female who lived on Meliflar Station in the Mendenbatt system. She was the daughter of Hallaf, a smuggler who owned the station. After Abeloth visited the station, she infected Fala with her dark side energy. This caused the crew of the station, led by Cardya, to mutiny against her father. She was put into the brig along with Hallaf and there, Jedi Luke and Ben Skywalker along with Vestara Khai found them. Master Skywalker healed Fala, and in her mind, Luke found the clues that Abeloth was directed to Nam Chorios. The Jedi departed with the gratitude of Fala and her father.",
