 "content": "CT-1284, nicknamed \"Spark,\" was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. During the Battle of Christophsis, Spark formed part of the clone crew aboard the Republic stealth ship, where he served under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Commander Blackout.\nSpark was drafted in as a crew member of the stealth ship after one of its original members was killed. Despite originally being told that they were to deliver vital supplies to Senator Bail Organa on the surface of Christophsis, the plan soon changed when General Anakin Skywalker chose to attack Admiral Trench's command ship directly. The crew of the stealth ship were able to then destroy Trench's cruiser, allowing the delivery of supplies to the planet's surface. After they arrived, Spark was told by Commander Blackout that he was now officially part of the stealth ship crew.",
