 "content": "The mother of Neesha Tor was a female Twi'lek.\nThis Twi'lek was born in Ryloth prior to the Clone Wars. She lived near a female Twi'lek that watched her grow up. At some point, she deserted her daughter, Neesha Tor.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tor was a beggar and the Twi'lek bragged to Tor about her mother and said that if she had deserted Tor, then it meant she must've deserved it.\nNeesha Tor's mother was described by the female Twi'lek as smart and sweet and that everyone expected greatness from her.",
