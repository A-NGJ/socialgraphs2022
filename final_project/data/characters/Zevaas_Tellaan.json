 "content": "Zevaas Tellaan was a Chagrian male who served as a foreman in the Balmorran Arms Factory on the planet Balmorra while the planet was occupied by the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic. Sometime between 3653 BBY and 3642 BBY, Tellaan, who was known as a hard-nosed supervisor, convinced the Imperial occupiers that he could lead them to refugees in a nearby cave, but what they found instead was a stockpile of munitions. Tellaan promptly detonated the weapons, killing himself and the Imperials he had tricked; his sacrifice served as a distraction, allowing his former employees and their families to escape off-world.\nZevaas Tellaan was mentioned in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, published as a tie-in to the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
