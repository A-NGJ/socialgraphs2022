 "content": "Vyn Holpur was a male Human Sith Saber in the Lost Tribe of Sith and the Captain of a ChaseMaster frigate in the Lost Tribe's fleet, the Starstalker. He served under High Lord Sarasu Taalon as a part of the strike force sent to Dathomir to force Luke Skywalker to ally with them to eliminate Abeloth, in the Maw. Skywalker proposed that they utilize Lando Calrissian's asteroid tug for assistance in navigating the Maw, and so the Jedi and Sith decided to wait for Calrissian at Klatooine. Eventually, the allies left to wait for Calrissian just outside the Maw, leaving Captain Holpur and the Starstalker behind with Leeha Faal and the Winged Dagger. Taalon gave an order for Faal which she relayed to Holpur, to acquire wintrium samples from the sacred Fountain of the Ancients on Klatooine. Holpur led his crew in their mission, although they were met with resistance by Klatooinian guards. They obtained the samples, but the Starstalker was attacked by Hutts who were called to protect the Fountain. The Sith were captured and brought to trial by Calrissian and Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, who had just arrived in-system. Faal claimed that Holpur and his crew had acted of his own accord, and Holpur upheld her lie. Solo and Calrissian weren't fooled, but they had no proof that Faal was guilty, and so only were able to convict Holpur and the crew of the Starstalker. Holpur and his crew were then sentenced to death.",
