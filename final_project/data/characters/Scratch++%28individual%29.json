 "content": "Scratch was a Human male member of the Exchange during the Galactic War. Around 3640 BBY he set up a shop in the Minev-Ra Caves on Voss, dealing with trade that was illegal by the Galactic Republic's standard but overlooked by the Voss. Ambassador Lokir-Ka sent the Voidhound to meet with Scratch and learn how Rogun the Butcher was able to smuggle Gormak technobeasts offworld. Scratch put the smuggler in contact with Jela Reneke and later helped them cover their tracks when Reneke framed the captain for the of technobeast smuggling she'd been doing herself. As the smuggler eventually disposed of Reneke, Scratch and Gormak Zak shifted their trade from Rogun to the captain, furthering his influence in the galactic underworld.",
