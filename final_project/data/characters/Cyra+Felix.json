 "content": "Cyra Feliz was the wife of the free-trader Vazan Felix.\nThe two had produced a daughter which they named Tine Felix, and whenever he had the two near Vazan was always cheerful. Unfortunately, Zhen Mirat needed Vazan's help for his criminal organization, The Fatal Visionaries. Knowing that he would not help willingly, Merit captured Cyra and her daughter Tine to use as leverage to gain Vazans help. While Vezan immediately handed over his ship, the The Fatal Vision, Merit in fact had no intention of giving him back his family. Cyra and Tine were held for over six months until eventually a group of rebels located and freed the two, returning them to Vazan.",
