 "content": "Xodlak'brov'omtivti was a Chiss female also known by her core name \"Lakbrovom.\" Lakbrovom was a member of the Chiss Xodlak family, a family within the government of the Chiss Ascendancy, and served as an speaker within the family. Around 18 BBY, she met Senior Captain Irizi'in'daro \"Ziinda\", who had left the Xodlak and joined the Irizi family. During their meeting, the Xodlak introduced herself and attempted to get her back while offering her a higher position or benefit than the Irizi had. However, Ziinda confessed that she did not care about positions or money, rather, she wished to leave as a Xodlak officer who held the rank of Blood had relived her of command during a battle and had got away with that by being Blood. Although Lakbrovom informed her that the officer would be reprimanded, Ziinda stated that she did not care about the Xodlak anymore, and left.\nXodlak'brov'omti appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final installment in the Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy by Timothy Zahn.",
