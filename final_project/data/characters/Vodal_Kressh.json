 "content": "Vodal Kressh was a Dark Lord of the Sith who lived hundreds of years before the Cold War.\nA descendant of Ludo Kressh, Vodal was an Alchemist who was considered to be the greatest in the Empire. However, as his madness and power grew, he rebelled against the Sith Emperor and fled to the planet Athiss which would become his final resting place. Even after his death and burial, many of his rebellious servants remained on the planet and their descendants occupied Vodal Kressh's tomb until they were wiped out by a strike team during the Cold War.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin thousands of years later, it was rumored that the Republic had destroyed Kressh and his followers, but that a dark cult still protected his tomb.",
