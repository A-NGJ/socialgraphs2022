 "content": "An Alderaanian philosopher once said that \"joy drives out fear\". The saying was known to Princess Leia Organa, who quoted it once to Kier Domadi in 3 BBY.\nIn the original edition of Leia, Princess of Alderaan, the philosopher's quote was \"strength through joy\". It was pointed out that the phrase had also coincidentally been used as a slogan by Nazi Germany. The novel's author, Claudia Gray, apologized when this was pointed out, claiming she had not known the real-life history of the phrase when she used it in the novel. The phrase was changed to \"joy drives out fear\" in later editions.",
