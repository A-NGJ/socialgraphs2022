 "content": "Osh Scal was a Kallidahin who worked for the Archaeological Research Council as a technician on a dig site in the Polis Massa asteroid belt. When the pregnant Senator Padmé Amidala was brought to the site with heavy injuries at the end of the Clone Wars, Scal was part of the team that aided her in giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia before she perished.\nOsh Scal was a Kallidahin technician who worked for the Archaeological Research Council at an archaeological dig site on an asteroid in the Polis Massa asteroid field. The Kallidahins at the dig site were searching for answers as to why the planet of Polis Massa had been destroyed and for traces of the extinct Eellayin species, whom they believed to be their ancestors.\nIn 19 BBY, at the end of the Clone Wars, Senator Bail Organa and the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda brought the injured and heavily pregnant Senator Padmé Amidala to the dig site so that she could give birth to the twins she was carrying. Scal was part of a team consisting of two trained physicians and several xenobiologists who attended to Amidala, but as her condition was judged to be extremely critical, the group did not even have time to change out of their caving jumpsuits.\nAmidala was placed in a medical facility designed for treating investigators rather than childbirth, and while she lay in labor, Scal and fellow technician Dznori Xam stood at a nearby monitor studying and gesturing at the readout. During the actual birth, the room was emptied, apart from Kenobi, a GH-7 medical droid, and a midwife droid. The twins survived the birth, but Amidala did not, having lost the will to live following the betrayal of her husband, Anakin Skywalker. She survived only long enough to name the children Luke and Leia.\nOsh Scal and the other Kallidahin technicians at Polis Massa had had little contact with humans and so did not know much about their parturition. They showed discretion and asked few questions of those accompanying the pregnant Padmé Amidala, although they were baffled when they could not save her life. The Kallidahin had purple-and-white skin and black eyes.\nScal wore a blue-and-brown, form-fitting caving jumpsuit with warming lines on the legs. It also included leg warmers, a utility belt, a voice-activated comlink, and a shoulder-mounted droid summoner and shoulder lamp. The technician also wore a wrist-mounted tissue analyzer and a head-mounted signal light.\nOsh Scal first appeared in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, which was released on May 19, 2005. In the current Star Wars canon, the character's name was revealed in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. This name originated in the Star Wars Legends reference book Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by James Luceno and released on April 2, 2005.",
