 "content": "Tiarsis was a Twi'lek businesswoman who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, she resided aboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system, where she owned the local cantina. Hence, she was known as the best informed person on the station. In 1 ABY, a spacer working for Rydel Delan, Tansarii Point's brawling master, helped Tiarsis with a bully who was scaring away customers and making a mess in the cantina. While doing so, the spacer discovered that a group of renegades calling themselves the Genesis Red was planning to sabotage the station. The spacer later fought and defeated the criminals, saving the lives of many beings on the station.\nTiarsis appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tiarsis was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
