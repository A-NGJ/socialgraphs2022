 "content": "Yensi Kolyin was a male Gran pirate that lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was working with the pirate Dalla Solo on Corellia, but when Kolyin wanted to get out of the business, Solo sent a spacer to kill Kolyin.\nYensi Kolyin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He appeared during a quest given out by Dalla Solo, in which the player had to travel to a specified location and kill Kolyin.\nBecause Yensi Kolyin spawned under the generic \"smuggler\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of eight possible depictions. He could either appear as four different types of Human males, or as four different types of Human females. Because the quest dialogue identified Kolyin as a male Gran, this article assumes that the eight possible Human depictions are non-canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
