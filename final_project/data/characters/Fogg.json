 "content": "Fogg was a gray-skinned, blue-eyed, tame, rancor that lived during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war, the rancor was slightly smaller in height than was normal for an adult member of the species. It also had blue coloring across parts of its hide.\nAfter slaying a rancor on the planet Umbara, an individual loyal to the Galactic Republic obtained Fogg as a pet.\nFogg first appeared as a companion that players of Sony's MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures could obtain between its launch in 2010 and shut down in 2014. It was a reward for the completion of the \"Rancor Tracking\" collection on the planet Umbara, all of the items of which were obtained by defeating a similarly colored rancor enemy on the planet. This article assumes players completed the collection as a part of 100% game completion.",
