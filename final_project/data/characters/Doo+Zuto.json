 "content": "Doo Zuto was a male Quara Aqualish crew member of the starship Woebegone.\nAs Zuto Doo and his comrades set out on a journey to Ithor from Bal'demnic, they realized that a Muun was hiding as a stowaway on the Woebegone. Upon debate, the crew decided to drop out of hyperspace and contact Bal'demnic authorities to see if the Muun was on the wanted list. The Sith Lord Darth Plagueis, who was in actuality the Muun stowaway, attacked the crew as he wanted to preserve the privacy of his affairs on Bal'demnic. Zuto Doo was killed during the fight with Darth Plagueis.",
