 "content": "Murr Danod was an Ithorian male who lived during the final years of the Galactic Republic. His given name translated to the Murr species, and his surname to winemaker. A smuggler, he worked for a trade guild that operated out of an Ithorian Herdship. In 32 BBY, Danod attended the annual Boonta Eve Classic Podrace at the Mos Espa Grand Arena on the planet Tatooine. From his seat in the audience, the Ithorian watched as the Dug Podracer Sebulba completed the first of three scheduled laps.\nDanod had white eyes and possessed skin the same color as the morality of the items he smuggled: gray. He enjoyed such dealings but was nevertheless a peaceful being who was honest to his customers. Danod was Force-attuned and a fan of Podracing.\nThe head and neck of Murr Danod first appeared in the audience during the Podracing sequence of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Initially unnamed, the character received an identity and backstory on a card included in the 2001 Coruscant Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
