 "content": "Nym was a Feeorin male pirate who led the pirate band known as the Lok Revenants. Near the end of the time of the Galactic Republic, Nym and his band of pirates operated on the Rimward end of the Corellian Run and along the Llanic Spice Run hyperspace routes. While the gang often targeted Trade Federation targets, they also harassed other criminals such as spicers and slavers. Nym and his Lok Revenants occasionally worked alongside the Jedi Master Adi Gallia.\nNym was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Collapse of the Republic, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products. Nym first appeared in the Star Wars Legends in Star Wars: Starfighter, a flight simulation game developed and published by LucasArts in 2001.",
