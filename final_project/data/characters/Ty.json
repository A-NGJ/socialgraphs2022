 "content": "Ty was a Mon Calamari male member of Dagger Wing, imprisoned on Belsavis along with the rest of the squadron after the Sith Lord Ondorru tricked them into bombing civilian targets on the planet Fest. During the invasion of Belsavis, Dagger Wing volunteered to aid the Republic prison forces keep order, and Symo, along with Lin and Symo, volunteered to help Guard Lieutenant Brok prevent the prisoner Gouge from escaping one of the labor camps. The group found Gouge, but they were pinned down until Havoc Squad arrived to evacuate them. After all members of the squadron were accounted for, Guard Captain Zess arranged for their transit to Macula Station, from where the pilots were able to rejoin the war effort.\nTy appears in the Trooper class mission \"Overwhelming Force\" on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011.",
