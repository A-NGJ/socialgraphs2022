 "content": "Zale Barrows was a Human male smuggler captain and privateer who was active during the Great Galactic War, Cold War, and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nHe participated in the attack on the Blockade of the Hydian Way in 3660 BBY and later led the freelancer Free Spacers Fleet against the Sith Empire in battles at Dantooine and Coruscant. After the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, Barrows accepted a job from the Republic as ferryman to the hidden prison world of Belsavis.\nDuring the Cold War, he was hunted by a bounty hunter agent of Darth Tormen. While on the run from the Hunter and Skadge, a Houk inmate whom Zale personally imprisoned, Zale journeyed into The Tomb to prevent Operations Group One from freeing its prisoners. Cornered by the Hunter and Skadge, he attempted to bargain to be allowed to stop the Imperials but the Hunter refused, having to let Skadge take his revenge by killing him.\nAfter defeating Zale, the player can choose whether to allow Skadge to beat him to death  or void their agreement and freeze Zale in carbonite.",
