 "content": "This Lamproid was present on the planet Kabal in 0 ABY. He had gray-green skin and white fangs. He was hunted down and killed by the Krish big-game hunter Tyro Viveca, who then had the body taxidermied. Viveca displayed the Lamproid as a trophy in his estate on that world. He had the Lamproid's body mounted to a wooden base and posed as if in mid-strike. The wealthy Krish showed off the dead Lamproid to Cecil Noone.\nViveca captured the Lamproid's mate, whom he sedated and locked in a force cage. Viveca intended to hunt her down at a later date.",
