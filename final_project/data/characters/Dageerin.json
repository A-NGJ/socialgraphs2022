 "content": "Dageerin was a male Aqualish situated in the village of Aurilia on the planet Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War. He was part of the forces who were in constant battle with the Sith Shadows. A Force-sensitive individual sent to the village by the Old Man was once referred to him by Captain Sarguillo. He sent the individual out to strike at several Shadows' bases so as to stop an attack by them. Soon after this, he once again sent the individual to strike eight of the Shadows to delay them while the villages defenses were being rebuilt.\nDageerin appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
