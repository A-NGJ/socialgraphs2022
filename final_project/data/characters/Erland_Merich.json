 "content": "Erland Merich was a Socorran merchant who dealt in Trauger gas. Taken in by the Ibhaan'I tribe after he was orphaned, Merich was not much of a scout or a hunter. Looking for ways to support the tribe, Merich began dealing in dangerous Trauger gas. Harvesting the gas led to Merich developing deformities on his hands and face and led to him developing a respiratory disorder. Merich's clientele spanned the galaxy, and he charged between five thousand and one hundred thousand credits depending on the size of the order. Merich drank to calm his nerves, leading to him becoming a chronic alcoholic.",
