Their profile in the New Republic prison registry was one of several that Marshal Carasynthia Dune looked at from her office on the planet Nevarro in around 9 ABY while searching for the profile of prisoner Migs Mayfeld.\nYath Endidee's profile first appeared in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\", the sixth episode of the second season of The Mandalorian, which was released on December 4, 2020.",
