 "content": "Shynne was a Human female who was raised on the Deep Core planet Prakith during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Shynne studied the ways of the dark side of the Force as a member of the Inquisitorius, an order of Dark Jedi who served the Empire, and she resided in the Citadel Inquisitorius, the order's headquarters on Prakith. At some point, the Inquisitors captured a member of the New Jedi Order, and Shynne planned to help turn the Jedi to the dark side.\nShynne was a Force-sensitive Human female who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Raised by the Inquisitorius, an order of Dark Jedi who served the Empire, Shynne was brought up in the Citadel Inquisitorius—the headquarters of the order—which was situated on the Deep Core planet Prakith. The Inquisitorius trained her to utilize the dark side of the Force, and she built herself a lightsaber. Shynne eventually became a fully-fledged Inquisitor, and she chose to operate within the Deep Core region so that she could remain close to the Citadel.\nFollowing the death of the Imperial leader, Emperor Palpatine, and the formation of the New Republic in 4 ABY, the Empire fragmented and was gradually displaced. Shynne continued to reside in the Citadel Inquisitorius along with remnants of the Inquisitorius. At some point, the Inquisitors captured a Jedi of the New Jedi Order who had ventured to Prakith on a reconnaissance mission. The Inquisitors began slowly turning the Jedi to the dark side as a rescue party was dispatched to Prakith to free the Jedi. Shynne greeted the rescuers when they arrived on the world, but she planned to force the captured Jedi to fight the rescue party, which she hoped would be the final act that would push the Jedi into the dark side's grip.\nA hard woman, Shynne was one of the most devout members of the Inquisitorius. She was cruel and effective in her role as an Inquisitor, and, when countering enemies of the Empire, she liked to pit allies against each other in order to break them. She had dark features and an angular face.\nShynne was adept in the use of a lightsaber, and she was skilled at utilizing the dark side's strong presence in the Deep Core to help her track down traitors to the Empire. She knew how to use the Force to influence the minds of others, to heal herself, to move objects, and to move quickly, and she was also trained in the use of the powers Battlemind, tutaminis, Drain Knowledge, Force empathy, Force stealth, and telepathy.\nShynne was created by Rodney Thompson and was mentioned in Byss and the Deep Core, Part 3: Prakith, an article that was published on Wizards.com in 2005.",
