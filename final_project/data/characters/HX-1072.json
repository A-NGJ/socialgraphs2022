 "content": "HX-1072 was a human who served as a stormtrooper in the military branch of the First Order. After the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron was captured by the First Order in the village of Tuanul on the planet Jakku in the year 34 ABY, HX-1072 worked alongside fellow troopers FN-2198, FN-3156, and JY-834 to perform a deep scan of Dameron's T-70 X-wing starfighter. The four reported to their commanding officer Captain Phasma that the scans had shown nothing of significance, and Phasma ordered the ship destroyed. Dameron eventually obtained a copy of Phasma's report on the scan results and included it in his flight log.\nHX-1072 was first mentioned in the replica journal Poe Dameron: Flight Log, which was written by Michael Kogge and released in 2016.",
