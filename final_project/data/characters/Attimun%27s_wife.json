 "content": "A Wookiee female married the Wookiee general Attimun and had two children with him prior to the Clone Wars. During the war, Attimun became a decorated war hero on the couples' home planet of Kashyyyk, however his wife and children were all killed in this conflict. Their deaths enraged Attimun, turning him against the Galactic Republic that the Wookiees had allied with in the War and leading to his attack on the speakers at the Conference on Kashyyyk.\nAttimun's wife first appeared as a hologram in the comic Incident on Kashyyyk written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Tanya Roberts. It was published in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.37 in 2012.",
