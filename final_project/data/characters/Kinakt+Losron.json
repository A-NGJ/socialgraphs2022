 "content": "Kinakt Losron was a Human male research engineer who was imprisoned by Moff Kentor Sarne at the Q'Maere Research Facility. He was freed by the crew of the FarStar, and joined them.\nLosron traveled to the Kathol sector as a representative of Kiharaphor Engineering as part of an evaluation team to determine whether or not the planet Kal'Shebbol was a good place to set up a new facility. The team decided that the planet was unacceptable under Moff Kentor Sarne's rule, but team was held by the warlord and forced to work for them. During his time under Sarne, Losron was one of the first to research DarkStryder technology, but he was unsuccessful in learning anything.\nSarne deemed Losron to be either incompetent or lying, so he was shipped to the Q'Maere Research Facility to determine which was true. The staff interrogated him, and found that he was neither. However, to simplify matters, they listed him as incompetent. Losron was placed with the general prison population, and he befriended Lowen Chase. When the FarStar arrived at the facility in 8 ABY, Losron assisted in the jailbreak and then volunteered for duty onboard the corvette.\nSeveral weeks after leaving Q'Maere, Losron was involved in Chase's mutiny onboard the FarStar, leading the group that took engineering. However, he was aware that the ship was in danger after being damaged by a lightstorm, and surrendered engineering without a fight when he could not repair the damage in time.\nLosron had a politeness that could be viewed as sarcastic, although he was good company. His accent suggested that he was possibly from a Core World.",
