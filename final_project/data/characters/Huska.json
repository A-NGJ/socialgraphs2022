In the show Huska was the nemesis of sector Ranger Novan Nune, and at one stage fought him in single combat. While Huska and Nune were not real, the show's story was based on the actions of the Belasco Free Volunteers after the assault on Parcovey Minor, a slave raid on the planet Parcovey Minor backed by the Utoradii kajidic of Hutts. The character Huska was mentioned by Thunys Albegron, Academician of Popular Studies, when Albegron spoke concerning the episode at the 6 ABY Conference on Popular Entertainment.\nHuska was first mentioned in the 2014 fifth entry in the Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut series of posts by Jason Fry on the StarWars.com blog. The article featured content cut from The Essential Guide to Warfare a book released in 2012 by Fry.",
