 "content": "Brahle Logris was an Human male assassin of immaculate appearance who would acquire the medical records of his targets, and prepare selections of rare delayed action poisons. It is believed he started his career with killing his own father in 2 ABY. Afterwards, he was a suspect, and tried, on murder charges three times, but was not convicted. In 8 ABY he was convicted for the attempted murder of a Sector Ranger on Gandalla, and sent to prison on Tamazall. It was suspected that he received help from a member of the Drellis Syndicate to later escape prison in 9 ABY.",
