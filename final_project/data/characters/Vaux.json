 "content": "Vaux was a human male who acted as a rebel contact sometime between 4 BBY and 3 BBY. While on the planet Garel, Phoenix Cell member Hera Syndulla sent Vaux and a woman on a mission to find starfighter parts for the squadron in a market, hidden in crates labeled \"Ronto Meat.\" Syndulla warned the pair about increased patrols consisting of Imperial stormtroopers. With that, Vaux and the woman departed on their mission.\nVaux wore tan clothing and a blue helmet which obscured half of his face and had the markings \"G6\" in Aurebesh. He also had light-colored skin.\nVaux appears in \"Blood Sisters,\" the eighth episode of season two of the Star Wars Rebels television series which aired on November 8, 2015. In the episode's script, the character was originally to be named \"Jebble\" and the crates he was to pick up labeled \"Wookiee Meat,\" but this was changed during production.",
