 "content": "A Sith captain was an officer in the Sith Empire during the Sith Civil War. The captain was posted on Dxun, and was the fifth officer to hold the post after his predecessors were killed either by the beasts of Dxun or their Sith superiors.\nA Sith captain was originally stationed on Korriban, and was eventually placed in command of the planet. He survived the Sith Civil War and the Republic bombardment of the planet that followed. After the Sith Empire split into various factions, the captain sided with the Sith Triumvirate.\nAfter the former commander of Dxun was executed by a Sith for failure, the Sith captain replaced him, though he took no joy in the posting. He was constantly plagued by the beasts of Dxun, and the high mortality rates among his own men.\nEventually the captain became concerned about the large military presence building up around the Dxun moons, and pressed his Sith master for reinforcements. The Sith, however, simply replied that soon it wouldn't concern him. When asked for specifics, the Sith merely told him that it was a \"surprise\".",
