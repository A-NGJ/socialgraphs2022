 "content": "Pehk was a male Geonosian hunter who was famous for being the first individual to headbutt a gundark. He was one of the hunters hired by Doctor Chelli Aphra to save her from the Shadowfang Beast, which had consumed her during her visit to the temple on the planet X3-299-11, prior to 3 ABY. When inside the temple, Pehk reached the feeding site of the Shadowfang Beast and mistakenly touched a decoy idol. The idol activated a tractor beam and it pulled him into the ceiling to join the skeletons of other unlucky adventurers.\nFollowing Pehk's misfortune, Aphra eventually hired the monster hunters Winloss and Nokk to \"capture\" the beast. When the pair reached the feeding site, they spotted a withered Pehk still attached to the ceiling. Pehk warned them not to trust Aphra as she told them to be ready for the Shadowfang beast. As it happened, the beast attacked the monster hunters and swallowed Pehk alive. Winloss remarked the time Pehk headbutted a gundark and joked about how quick he was killed.\nPehk first appeared in the canon comic Doctor Aphra Annual 2, written by Si Spurrier, illustrated by Caspar Wijngaard, and published on September 5, 2018.",
