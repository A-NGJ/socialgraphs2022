Admiral Trefaren asked Bria Tharen to accompany him to a reception held by the Corellian government for Imperial officers. Unbeknownst to Trefaren, Bria was a Rebel spy who had infiltrated her way into the Imperial base and was using the admiral to dig up information on new weapons and ships the Galactic Empire was acquiring.",
