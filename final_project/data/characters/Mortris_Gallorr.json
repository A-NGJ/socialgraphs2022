 "content": "Mortris Gallorr was a mechanic who lived in the town of Corestrike on Chrona. Gallorr settled on Chrona before the planet experienced a boom with the discovery of chronamite to start a family and indulge his love of fixing machines. Gallorr established a shop and gained a reputation as the best mechanic for fixing small vehicles and farming machinery. After the death of his wife, Gallorr turned the majority of the business over to his son, Arno and his wife Serise.\nGallorr was caught off-guard when the discovery of chronamite caused the town of Corestrike to grow up around his shop. As the town grew and people moved in, crime followed. Gallorr was a member of the Magistrate Council, and wanted to return peace and law to the town. To that end, he organized a fund to hire Protectors to act as independent law enforcement.",
