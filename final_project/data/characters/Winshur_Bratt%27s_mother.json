 "content": "The mother of Winshur Bratt was a human female who lived in the town of Bela Vistal on Corellia. In his younger years, Bratt's mother used to make her son go to a religious center, much to his disdain. As an adult, Bratt did his best to sever all ties with his hometown, including his mother, who, despite his efforts, repeatedly found him. Sometime during 34 ABY, after six months of no contact, Bratt's mother relocated her son at the Records Department of the Corellian Engineering Corporation, and sent him a communication, which he ultimately deleted.",
