 "content": "Torbill Danzin was a human male who was serving a twenty-five year sentence in Sunspot Prison for the attempted kidnapping of a senator. His profile in the New Republic prison registry was one of several that Marshal Carasynthia Dune looked at from her office on the planet Nevarro in around 9 ABY while searching for the profile of prisoner Migs Mayfeld. The human shared his name with a Tusken Raider criminal who also had a profile in the registry.\nTorbill Danzin's profile first appeared in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\", the sixth episode of the second season of The Mandalorian, which was released on December 4, 2020.",
