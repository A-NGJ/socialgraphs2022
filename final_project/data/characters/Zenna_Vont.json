 "content": "Zenna Vont was a female merchant who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. Working on board the space station known as the Vaiken Spacedock within the Imperial fleet, she provided other Imperials with equipment from her workplace in the supplies section of the station. While working she wore red armor.\nZenna Vont was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game she serves as an Imperial elite gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. She was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, she remains in the game, as her character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
