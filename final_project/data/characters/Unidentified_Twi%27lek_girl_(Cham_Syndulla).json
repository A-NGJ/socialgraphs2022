 "content": "A young Twi'lek girl lived on the planet Ryloth during the Clone Wars. In 22 BBY, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded her planet, she survived the slaughter carried out against many of her people, and took up residence with Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters in their hideout. After the forces of the Grand Army of the Republic broke the blockade of the planet and successfully landed ground forces on the surface of Ryloth, Jedi General Mace Windu sought out the Twi'lek freedom fighters and their leader, Cham Syndulla in hopes of convincing them to aid their plans to liberate their planet. After being escorted to their hideout in the ruins of Cazne, this girl enthusiastically greeted Syndulla with a hug. After retaking the capital city of Lessu and reclaiming Ryloth for the Twi'lek people, the girl participated in a parade to celebrate the Twi'lek and Republic victory.\nThe unidentified Twi'lek girl's only appearance has been in the twenty-first episode of first season of The Clone Wars television series.",
