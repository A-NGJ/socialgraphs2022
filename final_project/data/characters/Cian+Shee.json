 "content": "Cian Shee was a Human female slicer who was seen in the Outlander Club embracing her criminal partner, the bounty hunter Kalyn Farnmir. Shee had been hired during Farnmir's pursuit of the Zealots of Psusan's corrupt leader, Scri Oscuro.\nAt one point, Shee was contacted by members of the Zealots of Psusan and was offered a hefty payout in exchange for selling out her partner. Farnmir was informed of these dealings, and confronted Shee at the Outlander Club, but Shee escaped. Later, during the Galactic Empire's reign, Farnmir would kill Shee for her betrayal, besting her in single combat on Nar Shaddaa.\nCian Shee, a Human female, was a skilled slicer who, at a point prior to the Clone Wars' outbreak, was hired by the Kuati bounty hunter Kalyn Farnmir, who had been discharged from the Kuati Security Forces. The duo enjoyed some success rooting out small-time criminals and corporate thieves. One such criminal was Scri Oscuro, the High Priest of the Zealots of Psusan, who was using the church as a front for illicit activities.\nSome time after their takedown of Oscuro, Shee was contacted by members of the Zealots of Psusan, and offered a hefty payout if she were to sell out her partner, Farnmir. An informant also told Farnmir what the Zealots were planning, and that Shee was in on the plot. Farnmir then contacted Shee and organized a meeting at the Outlander Club, a nightclub located in Coruscant's Uscru Entertainment District\nThis meeting took place the same night that Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were in pursuit of Zam Wesell, after her attempted assassination of Senator Padm√© Amidala. Farnmir arrived at the club first, and interrogated the Zealot of Psusan Nyrat Agira, who confirmed the High Priest was on Coruscant and Shee had met with him. Farnmir and Shee met, Farnmir acting as if nothing was wrong, embracing her friend.\nThe two witnessed Kenobi and Skywalker apprehending Wesell, and as the two left the club, Farnmir attempted to pin Shee before Shee could attack her first, but Shee avoided and fled into the Coruscanti night. Shee called off the deal with Oscuro, now aware that Farnmir was expecting an ambush.\nShee was still active at the time of the Galactic Empire's formation, and also by the time the Rebel Alliance was founded, in 2 BBY. Shee took up Imperial contracts as a slicer, while her former companion Farnmir aided the Rebellion. At one point, Shee took a contract to take in Farnmir, and the two met on Nar Shaddaa, where Farnmir would best Shee in single contact and kill her former partner.",
