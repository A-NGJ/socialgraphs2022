However, she was sent to an Imperial prison after being framed for leaking information to the Rebel Alliance. Janq Paramexor, a leading bounty hunter, had heard of her skills and arranged for her to be freed in return for Sabran joining his guild. She agreed and put her training and skills to work for Paramexor's organization.",
