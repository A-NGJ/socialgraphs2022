 "content": "Rolex was the Sergeant-at-Arms for the Bank of Aargau Security Planetary Customs Security Checkpoint LH48 during the era of the Galactic Civil War. A neat and punctual Human male, Rolex's duties included conducting security checks for visitors to Aargau and keeping a daily log, in which he recorded information on customs checks and an hourly incident log detailing consequences dealt to violators of Aargau's customs rules.\nIn 3 ABY, Rolex performed the customs checks for Rebel leader Leia Organa and Sith Lord Darth Vader when they visited Aargau on business. Afterward, Rolex served as a Customs Field Investigator looking into a series of disturbances surrounding Organa and Vader's corresponding visits. Although Rolex pursued a connection between the two warring leaders' arrival and smuggler Li-Suun Niik, this avenue proved fruitless, and he later recommended that Organa and Vader both be immediately arrested on sight if they returned to Aargau.\nRolex first appeared in Star Wars  48, written by Larry Hama and released in 1981. In the comic, Rolex was illustrated by Carmine Infantino. The 2003 Wizards of the Coast article Aargau: For All Your Banking Needs later contained several passages written from Rolex's point of view, and containing additional information about his role.",
