 "content": "C'ar L'andara was a Twi'lek dancing girl and a high-ranking member of the Mytaranor Slaving Council.\nShe began her career as a slave to Moff Alexander Julstan IV of the Arkanis sector, until she ran away. In a matter of hours, she was re-captured by Talas Piran, leader of the Mytaranor Slaving Council. Piran, however, decided to keep her instead of returning her, thinking that the resourceful fugitive could be a useful addition to the Council. L'andara began helping the Council in business transactions with Twi'lek slavers. Although new in the business, she showed a natural skill in a short time.\nC'ar L'andara was mentioned in Alliance Intelligence Reports, a supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.",
