 "content": "Mosko Bolpa was a male Moggonite from Arorua who lived a decade before the Invasion of Naboo.\nBolpa was rescued from a Blagwahr snare by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in 44 BBY, but denied that he ever needed help to Qui-Gon and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon took him back to their camp in the Arorua jungles, where Mosko arrogantly demanded food from them. Qui-Gon gave it to him, much to the chagrin of the annoyed Obi-Wan. Mosko left after that, but came back later and attacked the Jedi camp with several of his Moggonite friends; they were all quickly vanquished by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.",
