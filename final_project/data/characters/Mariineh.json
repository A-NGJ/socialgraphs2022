 "content": "Mariineh was a female Twi'lek Padawan who served as a member of the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nMariineh was born on Ryloth and became the Padawan of Jedi Master Silmis Vey. During the early stages of the Clone Wars, she was on the verge of becoming a Jedi Knight and volunteered to go to Argul to battle Separatists.\nMariineh made her only appearance in Only the Force, a scenario for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In that, the player playing as Mariineh can choose Mariineh's sex. However, she is described as being female in the biographies of the other playable characters, so that can be assumed to be her canonical sex.",
