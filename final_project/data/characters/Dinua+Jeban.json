 "content": "Dinua Jeban was a Human female Mandalorian commando who fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War. She was one of Boba Fett's supercommandos from the outbreak of the invasion, although she was only fourteen at the time.\nHer father had died before the war. Her mother, Briika Jeban, died in the first year. Shortly thereafter, Goran Beviin adopted her, as he had earlier agreed.\nAfter the war, Dinua married a man called Jintar, and they had two children, a son named Shalk and a daughter named Briila; as they were about seven and five respectively in 40 ABY, they must have been born in approximately 33 ABY and 35 ABY.\nAlthough she had been at war for five years in the conflict with the Yuuzhan Vong, Dinua stayed with her adopted father to raise the children during the Second Galactic Civil War, when Jintar took mercenary work. Their children were too young for both of their parents to go off to war.\nHer name derives from the Mando'a word \"dinui\" that means \"gift\".",
