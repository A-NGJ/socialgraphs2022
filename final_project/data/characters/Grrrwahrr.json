 "content": "Grrrwahrr was a male Wookiee hunter living in Rwookrrorro in 3956 BBY.\nDuring Revan's search for the Star Map on Kashyyyk, Grrrwahrr's hunting party was ambushed in the Shadowlands by cloaked Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, and only he survived, due to the timely intervention of Revan and Jolee Bindo, who slew his attackers.\nGrrrwahrr was healed of his injuries by Revan, who then agreed to slay the remaining Mandalorians and their leader.\nAfter Revan killed the leader of the Mandalorians, he presented the helmet of their leader to Grrrwahrr, who in turn awarded Revan with an item.\nIf Canderous Ordo is in the party with Revan, he will say that these Mandalorians who killed Grrrwharr's hunting party were the first to flee when the Mandalorian Wars turned against them and called them \"bloody cowards.\"\nHe was also supposed to have an Upari amulet in his inventory according to data in the game files, but this is left out of the final version.",
