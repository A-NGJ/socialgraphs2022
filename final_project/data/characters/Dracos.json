 "content": "Dracos, a Lizard Warrior, was a member of the Alliance of Free Planets who was part of a group of recruits that Luke Skywalker was given charge of to train just after the Battle of Endor. While giving them basic field and combat training, Skywalker never ventured into teaching about the Force; Dracos and a number of the other trainees were frustrated by this. According to Skywalker, he was cautious about teaching the techniques required which could possibly lead to the creation of another fallen Jedi, as was experienced with his father, Anakin Skywalker.",
