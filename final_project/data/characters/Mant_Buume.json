 "content": "Mant Buume was a male Human, who worked for CreedCon Construction during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nWhen CreedCon began construction of a race track through the jungles of the planet of Cularin, Buume led a group of construction workers who were tasked with building a bridge for part of the race course. However, they uncovered a mysterious cavern, which was home to an ancient creature, the t'salak, that had been imprisoned there by the Tarasin. The Dark Jedi Raik Muun traveled there and tried to free the creature, but was unable to do so, so took out her anger by capturing all the workers at the bridge construction site, including Buume.\nMuun took the captured workers to TX-38, a deserted factory, located on Tilnes, a moon of Cularin. She managed to obtain the t'salak and it touched Buume and the other workers with its tendrils, causing them all to enter a violent rage. However, they were eventually rescued by the Heroes of Cularin.",
