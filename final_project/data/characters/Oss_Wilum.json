 "content": "Oss Wilum was a Vultan male who served as a Jedi Knight during the days of the Old Republic. He was originally apprenticed to Jedi Master Garnoo, and would later train alongside Nomi Sunrider under Jedi Master Thon.\nHe was one of a select number of Jedi sent to aid Ulic Qel-Droma during the Naddist Revolt, and would later fight in the Great Sith War. During this conflict he was one of several Jedi tricked by the rogue Jedi Exar Kun into turning against the Jedi Order. Wilum was seduced by Kun's lies that he had discovered ancient Jedi secrets that the Masters of the Order were hiding from others. Following Kun's orders, Wilum returned to Ambria and attempted to slay Master Thon by calling upon two Hssiss from a nearby lake. Thon killed the Hssiss and was able to bring Wilum back from the dark side of the Force.\nAlthough nothing is known as to how he died, he was honored in a monument on New Holstice which was devoted to fallen Jedi, where his name was eternally whispered by the wings of a memory moth.\nOss Wilum spent his childhood on the planet Vulta, growing up to be a trader who constantly moved from one planet to the next, and keeping up the demands of his trade. He worried little about the grand scheme of things in the Galaxy—in fact, Wilum believed that nothing he did, or could possibly do, would ever matter to the Republic or the Galaxy. Wilum saw himself as but an individual who was only able to sustain a meager itinerant lifestyle whose only permanent home was his starship.\nHowever, while on a routine cargo run, events unfolded that pushed Wilum out of his inconsequential life. Wilum was on his way to Alderaan from the diamond mines of Arkania when his ship developed an engine failure, which forced him to drop out of hyperspace in the middle of nowhere. After making repairs, which he knew would only last temporarily, Wilum checked his maps and scanners for the nearest hyperspace beacon so that he could chart a new hyperspace jump. He discovered that the nearest beacon was a two day trip from his current position. Wilum reviewed his options, realizing that his only other choice was to make a blind jump into hyperspace—and since he did not relish the idea of hitting a mass shadow or black hole, Wilum decided to set his ship on autopilot and travel the two day journey to the hyperspace beacon.\nApproximately a day and half later, Wilum came across a seemingly abandoned spaceship which was drifting in a lazy spin. Wilum tried hailing the ship, but either the ship's communications systems were not operational or no crew members were still aboard to answer his calls. However, he scanned the ship and discovered several lifeforms, alive and healthy, on the stranded ship. During his scan, Wilum recognized the ship as a Republic courier vessel, a design which he saw on occasion during his trading excursions. Upon this realization, he came to the conclusion that a Republic courier ship traveling this far in deep space must be carrying important information. However, without communications or any way to download the information, Wilum had no way of delivering it to its intended recipient. With no other options, Wilum moved his ship as close as possible to the Republic vessel, and attached to it using his recently installed tractor beam.\nOnce Wilum arrived at the hyperspace beacon, he immediately sent out a subspace call to any Republic vessel within his broadcasting range. Even though he had sent a distress call using the damaged vessel's transponder codes and location, Wilum was reluctant to leave the Republic courier as he was afraid that pirates would stumble across it and its helpless crew. However, to his surprise a ship dropped out of hyperspace broadcasting a verified Republic transponder code. The ship quickly hailed Wilum and told him to immediately leave the area—since Wilum was able to verify the new ship's transponder code, he willingly complied and set a new course for Alderaan.\nAfter this encounter, Wilum did not waste any time pondering the fate of the two Republic ships. But one day, more than two weeks after the rescue, Wilum read in the HoloNet News that an important military communiqué from a Republic Expansion Fleet had just been received in Republic City. The newscast revealed that the communiqué would have arrived earlier, but the courier ship carrying it ran into some technical troubles during its travels and that it became stranded. The newscast continued by retelling the story of the stranded ship's rescue, but for security reasons left out the fact that it was Wilum who had initially found the ship. Wilum, though, understood the security measures and did not feel slighted by being given no credit. Even so, he marveled at the fact that someone as insignificant as he was could have any type of impact on the course of Galactic events. However, this realization was soon shattered by another revelation—that, up to this point, he had been wasting his life and neglecting his duties as a member of a larger galactic community. His entire life had been focused on work, money, and personal pleasure. However, it had never occurred to Wilum that maybe he should look deeper, and to examine the meaning of his life and how he could help better the galaxy. After more than a year of personal reflection and of observing the finer ways of the galaxy, Wilum realized that something was calling him to look more closely at those who called themselves Jedi. He immediately set out in his ship and began his quest to learn what it was to be a Jedi.\nWith his new outlook on life, Wilum followed his feelings and was led to the Neti Jedi Master, Garnoo. Master Garnoo discovered that the young Oss Wilum had a strong affinity towards the Force, and decided to take Wilum as his Padawan learner. However, before Garnoo could complete Wilum's training, the Jedi Master was unexpectedly killed. Following his master's death, Wilum was devastated and doubtful of how his training would continue—that was, until Master Thon of Ambria decided to continue the young Jedi's training. Wilum traveled with Thon back to Ambria and took up residence with the Tchuukthai Jedi.\nUnder the guidance of Master Thon, Wilum's abilities progressed rapidly, even despite his late acceptance for Jedi training. He trained under Thon for five years, and it was during the fifth year that Nomi Sunrider arrived on Ambria looking for the Jedi Master. Her husband, the Jedi Knight Andur Sunrider, had been on his way to see Thon when he was killed by criminals, and Nomi Sunrider took up his lightsaber to defend their daughter and herself. Andur Sunrider returned to his wife as a Force ghost and told her to go Master Thon to be trained as a Jedi. Upon her arrival on Ambria, she was greeted by Oss Wilum who rode upon the back of a great beast, which in reality was Master Thon. Nomi Sunrider mistook Wilum for the great Jedi Master that her husband had told her about—a deception that was common about Thon's species, the secretive Tchuukthai.\nThe criminals who had attacked Sunrider's husband, employees of Bogga the Hutt, tracked Sunrider to Ambria in search of the rare Adegan crystals that she carried with her. They attacked Thon's home upon learning that Sunrider was there, and Wilum rushed out to defend her from the criminals. Wilum fought well against those attacking, but the sheer numbers of his opponents overwhelmed him, and he was soon defeated. However, it was at this moment that Master Thon chose to reveal himself and dispose of the attacking criminals, thus saving Wilum and Sunrider.\nFollowing the criminals' assault, Wilum helped repair Sunrider's droid, A-3DO, which was damaged during the attack. While Wilum was performing the required repairs, Tott Doneeta arrived from Onderon to enlist the help of Wilum in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. With the permission of Thon, Wilum departed with Doneeta for Onderon to help combat the dark side energies there.\nWilum accompanied Doneeta back to Onderon where he was introduced to the great Jedi Master Arca Jeth. Immediately upon arriving at Iziz on Onderon, Wilum witnessed the funeral procession of the late Queen Amanoa—he also sensed something strange, and saw its manifestation in Master Jeth's being. Jeth revealed that what Wilum was feeling was the dark side energies that were still imbued in the ancient city. He then told Wilum of the history of the conflict on Onderon, and described the most recent fight which had ended with the discovery of the remains of Freedon Nadd and the death of Queen Amanoa—Jeth then stressed that it was vitally important to the well-being of Onderon for the remains of Nadd and Amanoa to be taken off-planet, to the orbiting moon of Dxun.\nHowever, during the ensuing funeral procession, the dark apprentice Warb Null attacked, hoping to make away with the tombs of Freedon Nadd and Amanoa. During the fight, Wilum helped defend against the attacking Naddists, as well as the onslaught by Warb Null. Once Null and the Naddists had gained control of their prize, they retreated back to their war machine and into the sub-levels of the kilometers deep city.\nFollowing the skirmish with Warb Null, Jeth sought out the seemingly decrepit King Ommin at the advice of his daughter Galia who mentioned that Ommin was once a powerful dark side user. Master Jeth, however, was caught unaware and taken prisoner by a rejuvenated Ommin, who was being provided with an unnatural vitality by the spirit of the long dead Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd. The capture of Arca Jeth prompted his apprentice Ulic Qel-Droma to put out a call for Jedi reinforcements—in response to this, the gathered Jedi on Ossus decided to send a team of five Jedi to aid Qel-Droma, Wilum, and the other Knights on Onderon. The team consisted of the Jedi Knights Dace Diath, Shoaneb Culu, Kith Kark, Qrrrl Toq, and Nomi Sunrider. The new team of Jedi arrived on Onderon and immediately began fighting their way to where Wilum and the other Jedi were. The Jedi fought their way through and met up with Wilum, Doneeta, and Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and together the Jedi stormed Ommin's fortress to rescue Master Jeth.\nFollowing the defeat and death of King Ommin, Wilum and the other Jedi were present on Dxun while Master Jeth oversaw the internment of the remains of Freedon Nadd in a reinforced tomb.\nThe defeat of King Ommin earned the Jedi gathered on Onderon a much needed respite from battle. During this time, Wilum and the other Jedi had the special privilege of being taught how to ride the flying beasts that were native to Onderon. However, the Jedis' rest was to be short lived—Master Jeth arrived to tell them of the growing troubles in the Empress Teta system. Following his briefing of the Jedi, Jeth instructed Wilum, Diath, Toq, and Culu to return to the library world of Ossus. Once there they were to inform the leaders of the Jedi Order, and then the leaders of the Republic, about what they had encountered on Onderon and how it was related to the situation that was developing in the Empress Teta system.\nUpon receiving the news about Onderon and the Empress Teta system, the Republic and Jedi leaders organized a joint task force to be sent to the aid of Koros Major, the last planet left in the Tetan system which was resisting the coup. However, the Republic and Jedi fleet was repelled by the Sith magic of the Krath, and Ulic Qel-Droma was wounded by shrapnel.\nFollowing this battle, thousands of Jedi descended upon the planet of Deneba to hold a conclave on Mount Meru, in which Oss Wilum, along with Ulic Qel-Droma and others who fought in the Naddist Revolt, participated. However, during the gathering, Krath war droids descended upon the assembly, and during the ensuing fight, Master Arca Jeth was killed. Qel-Droma was devastated by his master's death, and vowed to infiltrate the Krath and bring them down from within.\nEventually Qel-Droma did manage to infiltrate the Krath and work his way up their ranks. However, it soon became apparent that Qel-Droma was slowly slipping into the dark side. The Jedi attempted twice to rescue Qel-Droma from the Krath—it was during the second attempt that they attacked Iziz to try and regain Qel-Droma. During this battle, Wilum was one of several Jedi who flew the new, but still experimental, Star Saber Starfighters. During a fly-by of the city, Wilum saw Exar Kun approach the royal palace, and had a vision that he would one day know and train under him.\nThe efforts to rescue Qel-Droma failed, and Qel-Droma eventually joined forces with the Dark Lord of the Sith, Exar Kun. Wilum and the other Jedi retreated, unsure of the future that lay before them.\nWith the beginning of the Great Sith War, Exar Kun traveled to the Jedi stronghold of Ossus to speak to those Jedi Knights who held the most potential, hoping to recruit them to his cause. Among the Jedi who were gathered to hear Kun speak, were Oss Wilum and Cay Qel-Droma. Kun claimed that he had discovered lost Jedi secrets, and that he wished to share them with those who would follow him.\nAt first, however, Wilum was not comfortable with these claims, since to follow Kun would mean that one would have to leave their Jedi Master. Kun countered by saying that the older generation of Jedi had lost touch with the changing times, and that that was why Master Jeth had failed to contain the dark side energies on Onderon. Kun argued that he had in fact succeeded where Jeth had failed—Kun claimed to have traveled to Onderon, where he found the spirit of Freedon Nadd and destroyed him. Kun told Wilum and the others that when he found the Dark Jedi, he talked to Nadd, and learned things—specifically the locations of where ancient Sith artifacts were hidden. Upon learning Nadd's secrets Kun then supposedly vanquished the Dark Jedi. However, being two of the Jedi present at the Naddist Revolt, Wilum and Cay were both skeptical of Kun's claims, and outright told him so. Kun, though, produced an ancient Sith amulet which projected the scene of Kun striking down the spirit of Freedon Nadd. Not surprisingly, Wilum and the other gathered Jedi were shocked at this revelation. Kun, upon seeing the effects the amulet was having, advised the other Jedi that he was not content to leave things hidden like the older Jedi Masters; that if they were like him, that if they cared about the future of the Jedi Order, then they would then join him in studying the ancient secrets, and change the galaxy.\nFollowing their meeting with Exar Kun, many of the Jedi decided that what he was saying was the truth and that they would follow him in his quest to change the galaxy, and decided to seek out Kun—Oss Wilum was among their numbers. They found Kun in the libraries of Ossus, where he had just killed the Jedi Master Odan-Urr, and advised him that they were willing to follow him to Yavin 4. However, upon arrival on the jungle moon, Wilum immediately felt something strange surrounding them. Once Kun had led the Jedi closer to an ancient temple, Wilum again stated that something was wrong about the place before them—that it appeared to be tainted by the dark side. Wilum concluded that he did not want any part of what Kun had to offer, and decided to return to the ship. However, before Wilum could reach the ship, a large group of Massassi warriors attacked him. Zona Luka and the other Jedi rushed to Wilum's aid, helping keep the Massassi at bay. However, it was only when Kun ordered them, that the Massassi fell back.\nKun told Wilum that what he was feeling was correct—that Yavin 4 was indeed heavily tainted by the dark side, but that he had now claimed the planet and intended to cleanse it with the light side of the Force. Wilum turned and reluctantly made his way to the front of the gathered Jedi, to hear what it was Kun was talking about. Kun held before him a stolen Sith holocron, claiming that by shattering it in the Jedi's presence, then they could begin destroying the dark side energies on Yavin 4. Wilum and the other Jedi raised their hands to protect themselves from the flash of the holocron's destruction—however, when Kun destroyed the artifact, faint remnants of ancient Sith power became imbued in the shattered fragments and these shards became lodged in the raised hands of the Jedi. Wilum immediately felt it as ancient Sith magic began to take its hold over his mind. The glass shards, which had embedded themselves in Wilum's hands, slowly disappeared, and Wilum and the others ceased being Jedi—they were now Sith apprentices.\nThe events on Yavin 4 provided Kun with a willing cadre of Sith apprentices who would not hesitate to do his bidding. To help consolidate his coming rule of the galaxy, Exar Kun issued death sentences on all the older Jedi Masters, whom he knew would stand in his way. The task of assassinating Master Thon fell to his onetime student, Oss Wilum. Wilum traveled to Thon's home on Ambria with Crado, and together they attacked Thon's home. Wilum used his new Sith powers to call from a nearby lake a group of Hssiss which he then used to press the attack. However, Thon and the Jedi Knights Sylvar and Nomi Sunrider fought back against the attacking Sith, killing the Hssiss and driving Crado to flee. Wilum, however, was wounded and captured by his former master who eventually helped Wilum overcome the Sith possession of his mind, though it could not be completely healed.\nThon was eventually able to help bring Wilum back from the dark side, and the newly redeemed Jedi was one of those present on Ossus in the hours preceding its devastation. During this time, Ulic Qel-Droma was confronted by his brother Cay and the two engaged in a vicious lightsaber duel. The outcome saw Qel-Droma slay his brother, and while he held his dead brother, Qel-Droma was stripped of the Force by a distraught Nomi Sunrider. Following this action, Wilum comforted his one-time friend, Qel-Droma, and told him that even though he was on the verge of being consumed by guilt, the Jedi still had to stop Exar Kun—it was their duty as Jedi. Qel-Droma led Wilum and the others to Yavin 4, where they confronted Exar Kun, and used their combined powers to defeat the Dark Lord.\nNothing is known of the eventual death of Oss Wilum, except that his memory was honored in a monument on New Holstice which was dedicated to fallen Jedi.\nFollowing the Second Battle of Jabiim, during the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker and A'Sharad Hett were on New Holstice helping at the Republic military hospital established there. During one traumatic experience in the trauma ward, Anakin used the Force to massage a dying Jedi's heart, in an effort to keep her alive—however, his efforts only increased the pain that she was suffering. A'Sharad confronted Anakin about this, and realized that Anakin was having a difficult time accepting that death was a natural state of life, and essentially, the Force. To demonstrate his point, he took Anakin to a monument near the hospital which was dedicated to the memory of fallen Jedi. Upon seeing the monument, Anakin could hear a memory moth whispering to him—he reached into the soft glowing light of the monument and grabbed the memory moth, holding it to his ear. He listened to it as it continually whispered a name in his ear—Oss Wilum. A'Sharad showed Anakin how to use the memory moth to remember the names of the fallen, thus allowing Anakin to gain some closure over the many friends he lost in the killing fields of Jabiim.\nDuring his life, Wilum was known to have been a considerate and caring individual who would go out his way to help not only his friends, but strangers as well. In the years prior to his becoming a Jedi, Wilum went out of his way to aid a damaged and stranded Republic scout ship which was in need of help. Even though his own ship was severely damaged, and he was also unable to reach anyone on the Republic ship, he nonetheless went out of his way and attached a tractor beam to the other ship and towed them safely. Due to his consideration of those in need of help, the Republic ship was able to reach the Galactic Capital and deliver the important message that it carried.\nOss Wilum was an extremely talented Jedi who held immense Force potential. Not only did Master Garnoo see this in Wilum when he first encountered the young Vultan, but Master Thon also recognized this potential, and as a result decided to teach the young Jedi how to achieve a deeper understanding of the Force. Wilum was adept at a Sith version of the beast trick power--using it to command the Hssiss on Ambria to attack Master Thon.\nThroughout his whole life, Wilum was known as a skilled pilot, and he demonstrated this ability on many occasions: before Wilum became a Jedi, he worked the spacelanes as a trader, literally living out of his ship, and always traveling from planet to planet. Wilum's piloting skills were again later witnessed during the Krath Conflict when he flew a Star Saber XC-01 starfighter against the Krath forces on Iziz.\nWilum was also a skilled mechanic, and it was during one of his many trading excursions that he experienced a critical engine failure, which forced him out of hyperspace in the middle of nowhere. He would have became stranded, except he improvised and managed to implement a number of short-term repairs on his ship, enough so that he could limp his ship to the nearest hyperspace beacon which was two days away, at sublight speed. During Wilum's training under Master Thon, he again demonstrated his mechanical ability when he fixed Nomi Sunrider's droid, A-3DO, who had become damaged in a skirmish with attacking criminals.\nThe Power of the Jedi Sourcebook incorrectly states that it was Oss Wilum and Dace Diath who were first asked to test the experimental Star Saber Starfighters. As per the sub-series Dark Lords of the Sith of the Tales of the Jedi series of comics, it was Dace and Cay Qel-Droma who were asked to try out the new starfighters.",
