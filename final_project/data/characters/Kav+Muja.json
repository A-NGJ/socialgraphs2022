 "content": "Kav Muja was a colorful Elomin smashball analyst. He was known for his vocal support of Elomin smashball players over non-Elomin players.\nIn 22 BBY, during remarks broadcast during second recess of a match between the Elom Ranphyxes and the Corellian Dreadnaughts, Muja attacked the Elomin junior leagues' practice of letting off-world players come to Elom for training. He claimed that off-world players from planets like Naboo were taking spots from young local players, and making it impossible for Elomin players to keep up their skills.\nKav Muja was also outspoken in his politics. During the Separatist Crisis, he sharply criticized planets which threatened to leave the Galactic Republic. He believed that instead of continuing to air their grievances, Separatist-leaning planets should \"shut up\", secede, and not attempt to rejoin the Republic.",
