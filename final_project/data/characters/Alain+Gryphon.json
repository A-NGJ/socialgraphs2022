 "content": "Captain Alain Gryphon was a Human female who commanded the Alliance to Restore the Republic transport Celestial during the Galactic Civil War. The ship was taken over by the prisoners she was transporting to an Alliance safe world, and an accident sent the Celestial into otherspace and was taken aboard the Charon's vessel, the Desolate. Gryphon was badly wounded by the Charon's poison-tipped claws, and died shortly after meeting an Alliance team that had also been dragged into otherspace.",
