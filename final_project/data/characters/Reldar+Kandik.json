 "content": "Reldar Kandik was a male Duros pilot. Kandik served with the Republic Starfighter Corps as a Captain in Rana Squadron during the Cold War. While on a mission on Taris, Kandik and the rest of his squadron were shot down, and Kandik was the only survivor.\nReldar Kandik was a male Duros who served as a pilot during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. He served in the Republic Starfighter Corps, as the captain of the all-Duros Rana Squadron. Around 3643 BBY, Kandik and his squadron were assigned to Taris to perform a mission.\nRana Squadron was tasked with destroying a captured Taris Reclamation base in order to protect the confidential data of military tactics. However, the Death's Claw pirates attacked Rana Squadron and destroyed the fighters, and Kandik was shot down. The lone survivor of this mission, Kandik was stranded on the shores of Lake Brell. He met a Republic-allied individual, who offered to help complete the mission when they heard of Kandik's predicament. The individual destroyed three of the base's power couplings to gain access to the computers, fighting their way through the pirates. After the individual destroyed the sensitive information, Kandik thanked them and traveled back to Olaris.\nReldar Kandik was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Kandik appears on the Republic version of the planet Taris, where he gives Republic players the Heroic mission \"Total Elimination\".",
