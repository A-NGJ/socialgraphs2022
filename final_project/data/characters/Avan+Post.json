 "content": "Avan Post was a Human male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the last decades of both. Training his Padawan learner, Olana Chion, to Knighthood, Post served on many battlefronts of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 21.25 BBY, the Master perished fighting in the Battle of Ando. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine honored Post's sacrifice, and the Galactic Museum created a special exhibit on the Republic's capital planet, Coruscant.\nA Force-sensitive Human male hailing from the Core Worlds planet Chandrila, Avan Post was accepted into the Jedi Order, eventually reaching the rank of Jedi Master. At some point, Post took Olana Chion as his Padawan learner, and both served together for over a decade until Chion reached the rank of Jedi Knight.\nIn 22 BBY, the Clone Wars broke out between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Post served the Republic with distinction on various battlefronts during the early stages of the conflict but perished nine months into the war during the Battle of Ando in space over the planet after destroying seven Techno Union Hardcell-class interstellar transports.\nPalpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, praised Post's deeds, and Galactic Museum Master Curator Asran Headows created an exhibit honoring the fallen Jedi Master on the Republic's capital world of Coruscant. Nearly thirty years after Post's demise, in 7 ABY, the New Republic pilot and later Jedi Corran Horn discovered the exhibition, albeit damaged by the Galactic Empire. Horn activated a hologram of Post and viewed a detailed history of the Jedi Master's career.\nAvan Post first appeared in a hologram in X-Wing: The Krytos Trap, a 1996 novel written by Michael A. Stackpole. In April 2003, Post was mentioned in Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:3:22, an in-universe Holonet News issue published in Star Wars Insider 66. Post received an entry in the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia and was mentioned in Olana Chion's entry in the StarWars.com Databank.",
