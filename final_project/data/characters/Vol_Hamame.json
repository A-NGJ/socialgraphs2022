 "content": "Vol Hamame was a Human male who made his living as a thug and was once a member of Big Gizz's swoop gang before seeking greater profits with Phedroi during the Galactic Civil War. After intercepting a message about the survival of Boba Fett, the pair followed Dengar—who at the time was overseeing the Mandalorian's recuperation—out across the Dune Sea in hopes of eliminating the weakened Fett. His end was a grisly one as he and his companion were crushed under the full weight of an automated Slave I.",
