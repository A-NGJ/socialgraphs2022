 "content": "Fissol was a male Ithorian bounty hunter who worked with the Gamorrean hunter Gowski. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the pair learned of a Jedi on the planet Lothal from a Duros bounty hunter and traveled there in order to claim the bounty on the Jedi. Fissol and Gowski managed to locate and capture the Force-sensitive local boy Ezra Bridger; however, they were then defeated by his Master Kanan Jarrus. Jarrus mind tricked the pair to make them believe they had been misled and sent them to settle the score with the Duros, who they now believed had tricked them.\nThe male Ithorian Fissol worked as a bounty hunter during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Around five years before the Battle of Yavin, he and a Gamorrean bounty hunter named Gowski scared a Duros bounty hunter into revealing that he knew of a Jedi on the Outer Rim Territories planet of Lothal. The Duros had hoped to claim the bounty himself, as the price on Jedis' heads was incredibly high, but claimed he would let the two other hunters take it.\nThe pair agreed to go after the Jedi and traveled to Lothal, where they met with a local contact who worked with Fissol and learned the location of the Force-sensitive street urchin Ezra Bridger. Gowski then knocked out the contact and the two bounty hunters traveled to a cave where Bridger was trying to train himself to better use the Force. They at first observed him from a nearby ridge before confronting Bridger in the cave while the target was practicing jumping with the Force. Using Gowski's jetpack they then pursued the boy when he tried to escape, with Fissol following him through a crack in the wall that Gowski could not fit through. Fissol became stuck trying to fit his weapon through, but the Gamorrean circled round and caught Bridger by surprise, knocking him out with an electric shock.\nHaving subdued their quarry, the pair made to leave with Gowski carrying Bridger. Before they could exit the cave however, they were confronted by Bridger's Master Kanan Jarrus who beat both of them using his fists. Jarrus then placed the pair in stuncuffs and used a Jedi mind trick to make them both believed they have been tricked by the Duros and that they should go and settle the score. The pair then left Lothal in a YV-666 light freighter and found the Duros so they could took vengeance.\nFissol had brown skin, green eyes and no hair. He and Gowski believed they could capture a Jedi, despite believing a number of incorrect facts about them including that Jedi aged backwards, had extremely dense bones, and were capable of flight. The Ithorian was weak minded enough to be mind tricked by Jarrus.\nFissol wore a translator collar which allowed him to speak Galactic Basic Standard. He used a blaster rifle in combat and wore green and orange armor.\nFissol first appeared in \"Eyes on the Prize,\" a comic strip published in the sixth issue of the Star Wars Rebels Magazine, which was released in 2015. The comic was written by Jeremy Barlow and illustrated by Bob Molesworth.",
