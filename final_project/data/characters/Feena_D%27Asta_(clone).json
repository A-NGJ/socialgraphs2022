 "content": "This clone of Feena D'Asta took her place after the real Feena D'Asta was kidnapped by Grappa the Hutt in 7 ABY.\nWhen her father, Ragez D'Asta, retired from the Imperial Ruling Council sometime after her kidnapping, he appointed Feena to take his place, not knowing the daughter he was appointing was a clone.\nThe clone was inserted into the Council, where she participated in the plotting of Carnor Jax and later advocated an end to the war against the New Republic. She was falsely suspected of having assassinated Burr Nolyds, and called for a Vote of No Confidence against Xandel Carivusâ€”who had her arrested for treason.\nNew Republic Intelligence agent Mirith Sinn attempted to rescue her, but was captured herself. It fell upon Kir Kanos to rescue both women. He then returned the clone to her father, who opted to isolate his sector from both the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant.",
