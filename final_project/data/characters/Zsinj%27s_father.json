 "content": "Zsinj's father was a human male from Fondor. Near the end of the era of the Galactic Republic, he and a human female from Chandrila named Maarisa Zsinj produced a male child, Zsinj, who would eventually become one of the most powerful warlords in the history of the galaxy.\nA human male from Fondor, Zsinj's father was a simple mechanic by trade. He fathered a child with Maarisa Zsinj, a human female from Chandrila, and in the tradition of his Fondorian caste, their offspring bore a single name: Zsinj. Zsinj's father passed on some of his aptitude for engineering to his son, but Zsinj eventually took after his mother and enrolled in the Prefsbelt IV naval academy.\nAlthough Maarisa Zsinj went on to become a pirate, and the younger Zsinj became a Warlord of the Empire for hunting her down, multiple historical records make no further mention of Zsinj's father except in terms of his relationship to his infamous family.",
