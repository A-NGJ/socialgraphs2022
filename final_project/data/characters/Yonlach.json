 "content": "Yonlach was a male Human Jedi Master who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War. He was confronted and defeated by Darth Baras' apprentice in the latter's quest to eliminate Jaesa Willsaam, one of Yonlach's former Padawans.\nYonlach was considered the greatest teacher of his time and a valuable asset to the Jedi Order. He had long been the very model of the Jedi Code, a master of his emotions and unafraid of death. Though he had grown old by the time of the Cold War, the Force was still strong with him.\nJedi Master Nomen Karr eventually brought Padawan Jaesa Willsaam to train under Yonlach on Tatooine, and during this period her gift to determine a living being's true nature first manifested. Through Yonlach's training she developed a strong bond with him, and he believed that her ability, if untainted by the Sith, would someday lead the Jedi to greatness once more.\nEventually this relationship would prove to be a detriment to Yonlach, as the Sith became aware of Willsaam's ability. In order to defend his spy network from the Padawan's gift, Sith Lord Darth Baras, who had once in the past petitioned the Dark Council to eliminate Yonlach, sent his apprentice to kill the old master hoping it would draw her out.\nDespite living a recluse life in the hostile Dune Sea, Yonlach was found and confronted by Baras' apprentice. He refused to give up Willsaam's location and was defeated in the following battle, together with his bodyguard Yul-Li. Unwilling to see a Jedi Master die for just a Padawan, Yul-Li gave up Willsaam's identity but the Jedi Master was able to stop him before he could reveal anything else. Yonlach then offered himself up to death, hoping his former Padawan would only feel peace and tranquility in his passing, but his enemy tried to break his will by carrying out the killing in a painful way.\nYonlach was introduced in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic within a series of quests in the Sith Warrior storyline. The Jedi Master's fate can vary greatly depending on the player's options: he can also die a peaceful death or be spared by the Sith Warrior.",
