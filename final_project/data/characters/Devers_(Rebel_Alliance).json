Specifically, the vessel was being hunted by Admiral Garreth Holtz.\nOlin Garn, in order to recruit Ace Azzameen into the Alliance as a starfighter pilot, had to first get approval from Devers about the young man. The commander later participated in the Battle of Endor, again serving as tactical officer.",
