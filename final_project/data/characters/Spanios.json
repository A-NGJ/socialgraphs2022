 "content": "Spanios was a male Zabrak Jedi Padawan, who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Zabrak, Spanios was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, serving as the Padawan of Jedi Master Yollo. In the wake of the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Spanios studied on the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. During his training, Spanios fell in love with fellow apprentice, Moracen, as both were regularly assigned to work with each other. Developing a strong bond with each other, they discovered a rare lightsaber crystal amidst the ruins of the ancient fortress city of Kaleth. Despite their attempts at discretion, the pairs' masters became suspicious of their activities and sent another Padawan to discover whether the two apprentices were indeed romantically involved.\nWhen dealing with Moracen and Spanios, the Jedi Knight has three options. They can reveal the romantic relationship to Moracen and Spanios' relationship to their Masters , lie and keep it hidden , or lie, and later convince Spanios to break off the relationship with Moracen .",
