 "content": "Kurjak was a smuggler and the captain of the Fast Friend. In 0 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Kurjak and his crew picked up Inferno Squad members Gideon Hask and Del Meeko, who were posing as brothers in order to infiltrate the Partisan remnant cell known as the Dreamers. While en route to Eriadu, smuggling a container that was protected by a force field, the Fast Friend was attacked and boarded by members of the Blood Bone Order, a pirate gang led by the Pantoran \"Pirate Queen\", Lassa Rhayme. After Rhayme and her crew took Hask and Meeko captive, they left Kurjak tied to his command chair.",
