 "content": "H'rinnrada was a female Rodian bounty hunter.\nH'rinnrada was a Rodian bounty hunter who was intent only on gaining status within her clan. In fact, she dreamed of founding her own clan some day. She was a callous being, and approached every other sentient as a potential target. She was not known for her subtlety, and would attack her bounties in full view of the public. Her favorite weapons were her modified blaster rifle and neurostaff. She was completely untrustworthy and had been known to often turn on her employers immediately after completing her contracts.",
