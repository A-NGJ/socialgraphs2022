 "content": "Ur-Sema Du was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order in the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nUr-Sema Du was a Force-sensitive Human who received training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master after constructing a green-bladed lightsaber.\nWhen the Separatist Crisis between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted into a conflict on Geonosis, Master Du answered Master of the Order Mace Windu's call-to-arms by flying to the dust-covered world. As part of Windu's strike team assembled to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm√© Amidala from execution by the Confederacy leaders, Du landed on the plains of Geonosis outside the Petranaki arena. While her comrades attacked the arena from the grandstands, Master Du delved deep into the catacombs. Amidst the damp quiet of the insect-constructed facility, she was the first Jedi to encounter the monstrous General Grievous, a Kaleesh cyborg who was poised to lead the Separatist Droid Army in the coming Clone Wars. Wielding her lightsaber against Grievous' electrostaff, Du fought valiantly but was overpowered and killed by the General. Collecting her lightsaber as a trophy, Grievous left her body where it laid, his existence remaining a secret from the Republic until he was ready to unleash his full might on the Grand Army of the Republic.\nThis Jedi was the creation of artist Joe Corroney, who modeled her after fellow artist Jan Duursema, from whom the character also takes her name. The name originally appeared only on Corroney's website, and was thus not part of the canon. This changed after the mention in Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous, which made the name canonical.",
