 "content": "Daxxus was a Blarina criminal who operated in the Anoat sector at the time of the Iron Blockade. On one occasion, Daxxus deterred Imperials from inspecting their cargo by staining their face with berry juice and pretending to have the Anoat pox.\nEventually, Daxxus joined the crew of the Smuggler, who dispatched the Blarina on a variety of missions throughout the Anoat sector.\nDaxxus was created for the canon mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam for iOS and Android platforms and released in 2015, where they were a unique 5 star crew member.",
