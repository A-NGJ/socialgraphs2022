 "content": "Ortol was a general in the Mantellian Separatist Movement during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Reconstituted Sith Empire. During his time on Ord Mantell he committed for numerous war-crimes and was responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians. After the movement was suppresed and Ortol fled the planet with his remaining loyalists, Governor Chornarov of Cademimu V offered him and his soldiers amnesty for their crimes in exchange for aiding him in seizing Cademimu V and its vast military stockpile for himself after charges of corruption were brought against him by the Senate. While the uprising was initially successful, later records show that Ortol and his forces were defeated soon afterward by a strike team, although it is unknown whether this team was sent by the Republic or the Empire.",
