 "content": "Annaz was a female Falleen gangster who was part of the Malandro syndicate on the planet Tangenine. Her syndicate extorted places like the farm owned by Remba and Kelven. When their farm failed to pay up, Annaz killed them and left their children, Lauren Mel Coelho and Julien orphaned. Lauren took a job for the Malandro syndicate in order to pay for treatment for Julien but got caught and landed in jail leaving Julien to die of his illness. When the Galactic Empire came to Tangenine, they realized the Malandro syndicate was too embedded into the system and had bounty hunters clear the way for them. Lauren returned as a bounty hunter named Brand and attacked and tortured Annaz.",
