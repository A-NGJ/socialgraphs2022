 "content": "Zenia Starstrider was a female Nothoiin and the twin sister of Jado Starstrider. At some point before the blockade of their native Anoat sector by the Galactic Empire, she and her brother were caught in a fire on their homeworld of Nothoiin. They were rescued by the Data Seekers society, which they ended up joining. Zenia was possessed with a streak of independence that frustrated her brother, and found no challenge too great. Telling her that she could not achieve something would only make her try harder.\nIn the 2015 iOS video game Star Wars: Uprising, Zenia Starstrider was one of the many crew members that could be sent on Crew Runs for helpful items.",
