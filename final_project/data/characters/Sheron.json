 "content": "Sheron was a male Human Sergeant of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War. In 3639 BBY he was dispatched to Asation after Gree Gatemaster Beltek'k informed the Republic officials about the opening of the Grand Hypergate by Kephess, servant of the Dread Masters. Nameless creatures poured through the Hypergate and attacked Republic forces, wiping out six squads. Sheron contacted Major Cobus through a holocall and asked for reinforcements, but was killed by the creatures before help could arrive.\nSergeant Sheron appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic during the introductory cutscene for the \"Terror From Beyond\" operation on Republic side.",
