 "content": "Victra Sinde was a female Human spy who served the Galactic Empire during the years following the Clone Wars. Circa 17 BBY, Sinde was tasked with an undercover mission on the world of Alderaan to obtain evidence that the Imperial senator Bail Organa had committed treason against the Empire. However, she was unsuccessful at gathering any conclusive proof of his disloyalty.\nSeveral months after commencing her assignment to watch over Organa, Sinde was ordered to undertake business negotiations with the Hutt crime lord Darga on the planet Cato Neimoidia. While conducting her meeting with Darga, Sinde was recognized by a group of freelance agents whom she had previously crossed paths with on Alderaan. The agents revealed to Organa that Sinde was an Imperial spy, forcing her to abandon her undercover mission.\nVictra Sinde was a female Human who served the Galactic Empire as an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau intelligence organization an during the years following the Clone Wars. Around 17 BBY, Sinde was assigned to spy on Bail Organa, an influential Imperial senator from the planet Alderaan who was suspected of treason against the Empire. Under the alias \"Alysa,\" Sinde infiltrated Organa's personal security force and assumed a position within his palace in the city Aldera on Alderaan. In this role she also saw service aboard the Resurgence, an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate operated by the Alderaanian Security enforcement agency.\nAfter several months undercover, Sinde encountered a group of freelance agents in the halls of Organa's palace who had been summoned by the senator to undertake a mission to rescue the imprisoned Imperial admiral Gilder Varth. Sinde was unsuccessful at gathering any conclusive evidence that Organa had betrayed the Empire and days after the freelance agents met with Organa, the Imperial agent was temporarily re-assigned to undertake business talks with the Hutt crime lord Darga on the world Cato Neimoidia. Darga was covertly trading slaves and tibanna gas with the Empire for use on a secret project to construct a prototype Super Star Destroyer, and Sinde was ordered to re-negotiate the Empire's arrangement with the Hutt to secure a supply increase.\nAccompanied by two veteran clone stormtroopers, Sinde traveled to Darga's palace, concealed within the ruins of several abandoned Neimoidian estates in the city Zarra on Cato Neimoidia. Upon arrival, Sinde received an audience with Darga and set out the Empire's proposals, asking for the crimelord to double the amount of tibanna that he transferred to the Empire in return for an 80% rise in payments, claiming this to be a fair offer that would increase the Hutt's profits. The Imperial agent outlined that a further 20% payment increase was available if Darga upped the number of slaves that he procured for the Empire. As a gesture of goodwill, she also offered to provide Darga a personal Imperial security retinue, consisting of regiment of troops to be based in Zarra and a flight of Imperial starfighters.\nThe freelance agents that Sinde had crossed paths with in Organa's palace had joined Darga's entourage while on an assignment for the Alderaanian Resistance. The agents observed as Sinde set out the Empire's requests to Darga and the Hutt sought their advice on how to respond to her, agreeing to double the supply of tibanna but declining to provide additional slaves or accept the Imperial escort. The freelance agents recognized Sinde from their time on Alderaan and confronted her; she initially denied spying on Organa but after the agents repeated their allegation Sinde mentally made note of their names and faces and determined to make the Empire aware of the agents' activities. The freelance operatives subsequently informed Organa that Sinde was an Imperial spy and this revelation resulted in outcry at his court on Alderaan. Sinde received advance warning that Organa had been advised of her true allegiance to the Empire and she declined to return to her undercover assignment at the senator's palace.\nVictra Sinde considered her assignment to conduct business with Darga the Hutt on Cato Neimoidia to be well above her. She did not expect to encounter anyone at Darga's palace who would identify her from her undercover assignment on Alderaan.\nVictra Sinde appeared in A Wretched Hive, a roleplaying adventure by Rodney Thompson set within Star Wars Legends continuity that was published on Wizards.com on December 20, 2007. The adventure was the second instalment in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, a supplement to the Saga Edition of Wizards of the Coast's roleplaying game.\nIn A Wretched Hive, the players roleplay as the Alderaanian Resistance agents that cross paths with Sinde on Cato Neimoidia and it is possible for the players to recognize the Imperial agent from when the player characters traveled to Alderaan during the events of the previous Dawn of Defiance adventure, The Traitor's Gambit.Â  If the players did not previously roleplay The Traitor's Gambit they can instead recognize her from her time aboard the Resurgence. If the players are persistent with insisting that they recognize her from a previous encounter, Sinde makes sure to remember them and it is suggested that she could then act as an antagonist to the player characters later in the Dawn of Defiance campaign when the Alderaanian Resistance agents travel to the worlds of Nizon and Coruscant during the events of the Dawn of Defiance modules The First to Strike and The Core of Corruption respectively. It is also possible for the players to inform Bail Organa that Sinde is an Imperial spy, in which case her cover is blown and she does not return to Alderaan.",
