 "content": "Boran was a Human male Sergeant in the Republic Military during the Cold War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. He served aboard the Brentaal Star.\nSergeant Boran is the leader of the first boss group in Flashpoint: the Black Talon in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Boran and his group appear only if players choose the Light Side option during their conversation with Captain Orzik, keeping him alive. Community consensus reflects that Imperial players chose only the dark side option and therefore Boran's attack did not occur. It is unknown what happened to Boran and his team, or if they even existed, according to the canonical scenario. Since Sylas orders the shuttles to be shot down, it is possible Boran and his squad were shot down and perished before they could even reach the Black Talon in the dark side option.",
