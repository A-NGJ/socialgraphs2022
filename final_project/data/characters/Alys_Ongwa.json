 "content": "Alys Ongwa, nicknamed Crash, was a human female Corellian who lived on Corellia during the High Republic Era. She grew up in the bodyguarding business, eventually coming to lead a security crew. Following the attack on Valo, Ongwa and her crew were tasked with protecting Chancellor Lina Soh of the Galactic Republic during a visit to Corellia. At the time, Ongwa was sixteen years old, and was accompanied by the droid 10-K8.\nAlys Ongwa was created by Daniel Jos√© Older for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative. Older first hinted at the character through her nickname of Crash in an episode of Star Wars: The High Republic Show on July 28, 2021, while Ongwa was formally revealed in a later episode of the show on November 17. Ongwa debuted in \"Crash and the Crew Do What They Do,\" a comic story written by Older, illustrated by Jesse Lonergan, and published in The High Republic Adventures Annual 2021 by IDW Publishing on December 15, 2021.\nOlder created the character as a tribute to writer Alyssa Wong, tuckerizing Wong's name. Having asked her what role she would like to play within the Star Wars universe, Older based Ongwa and her occupation on Wong's answer. Ongwa's pink hair was a request from Wong.",
