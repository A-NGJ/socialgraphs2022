 "content": "Chaney Barrow was a female Human slicer and computer expert living during the Cold War. She was motivated by greed and known to hold grudges. Formerly a top saboteur of the Exchange crime syndicate, she was captured and imprisoned in the Belsavis prison by Galactic Republic. During the Invasion of Belsavis around 3641 BBY she was sprung out of her cell along with three other prisoners - Kanjon Slyke, Ohta and Paarkos. Their rescuer posed as a fellow inmate, but was in fact Imperial Intelligence operative Cipher Nine. The prisoners released were chosen for their skills and were asked to provide means to break into the Megasecurity Ward 23. To avoid the attention of SCORPIO's security system, they came up with a plan to reprogram security droids and order them to cause havoc, thus triggering multiple alarms at different locations at once, overloading SCORPIO's capabilities. The plan eventually worked, though SCORPIO managed to disconnect herself from the network and upload her consciousness back into the droid body. During the infiltration Barrow was betrayed and shot by Slyke.\nBarrow is killed by Slyke in the Dark Side option if the player does not intervene. She survives in the Light Side option.",
