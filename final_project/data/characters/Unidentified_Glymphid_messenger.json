 "content": "A Glymphid tracked down the Rebel Alliance pilot Luke Skywalker on the planet Nyemari to deliver a hologram from Rezi Soresh. He had been promised a large reward to deliver the message. The Rebels forced him stand while they played the message and planned on questioning him afterward. This Glymphid was killed using a time-released poison in front of Skywalker to demonstrate Soresh's reach.\nIn 1 ABY, the Glymphid was in Anem, the capital city of Nyemari. He was looking for the Rebel Alliance pilot Luke Skywalker, as a reward had been promised if he delivered a message to Skywalker. While Skywalker and his companions were conducting a mission, this Glymphid visited the South Anem Spaceport and met the Nyemarian mechanic Li Preni. Preni informed the Glymphid the Rebels were in town. After the mission, the Rebels returned to the South Anem Spaceport and met Preni themselves, who told them someone was following them. The Nyemarian lied about saying anything, but told the Rebels about the Glymphid when Chewbacca threatened him. Thinking the alien was a bounty hunter from Jabba the Hutt, Solo wanted to seek him out and deliver his own message to Jabba. Solo convinced his companions to join him.\nThe Rebels left the spaceport and went back into Anem to seek out the Glymphid. The Glymphid seemed to stay one step ahead of them before the Rebels cornered him in a dusty, disused plaza in Anem. The Glymphid informed them that he had \"found\" them. He stepped toward the assembled Rebels, only to stop when they all raised their blasters at him. He told them to stop, informing them he had a message. Solo was confused as to why Jabba would have sent him a message, but the alien informed him the message was for Skywalker. Pulling out a datapad, he described Skywalker, and then gave him a holochip and holoplayer. While the other Rebels debated whether to play the message, Solo grabbed it himself and started the hologram.\nThe message was from Imperial Commander Rezi Soresh. As Soresh introduced himself to Skywalker, the Glymphid backed away, but Solo stopped him, telling him to stick around and answer their questions. Soresh continued his message, saying he had business to conduct with Skywalker. He informed the pilot he had captured the colony vessel Endeavor, and was using the 100 people on board to as hostages to draw Skywalker to his outpost. Skywalker had twelve hours to present himself, and Soresh said he was watching him, and would provide a demonstration.\nThe Glymphid started screaming, then collapsed in front of Skywalker, and finally expired from some sort of activated poison. Skywalker wanted to leave to go to Soresh, but his companions would not let him go alone. They left to go meet Soresh and were all captured.\nThe Glymphid searched for Skywalker to receive a reward. He tried to back away when the Rebels were distracted, and he expressed fear when threatened by Solo, stuttering that he did not know anything.\nThe Glymphid appears in Alex Wheeler's 2010 book Rebel Force: Uprising.",
