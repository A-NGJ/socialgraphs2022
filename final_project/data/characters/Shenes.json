 "content": "Shenes was a male Human Imperial Navy Captain loyal to Emperor Roan Fel. In 138 ABY, Shenes commanded the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Fist of the Empire during the Battle of Coruscant. As the battle progressed, the Fist of the Empire was suffered heavy damage from Sith Annihilator-class starfighters, prompting Shenes to request aid, ensure his liege that he and his crew would fight as long as they could as well as proclaim his loyalty to the true Emperor. Shortly afterward, however, the Fist of the Empire was destroyed by the Sith starfighters. Captain Shenes perished alongside his crew.",
