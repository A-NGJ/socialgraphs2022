 "content": "Mynar Devis was a male Human who served as an officer in the Imperial Navy during the last years of the Galactic Civil War and afterward. He was the illegitimate son of Gilad Pellaeon and Hallena Devis.\nAt the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Devis served as the captain of the Wrack, an Interdictor cruiser; he was also trained as a starfighter pilot. From the age of five, he enjoyed listening to tales told about Han Solo and his famous starship, the Millennium Falcon.\nIn the wake of the Yuuzhan Vong's crippling of the HoloNet during Operation Trinity, Devis personally led the Wrack's complement of TIE Defenders to aid the Galactic Alliance forces at the Second Battle of Bilbringi. Devis defended the Millennium Falcon during its escape from the battle and, when the Vong appeared to be gaining the advantage, crashed his fighter into the enemy Vua'spar interdictor, sacrificing himself.",
