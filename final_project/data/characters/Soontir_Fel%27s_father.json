 "content": "The father of Soontir and Todr worked for Allied Grain and Roughage together with his wife.\nHe worked as a pilot until he was accidentally poisoned. Unable to continue his work, he secretly let his son cover for him, a secret that soon became public knowledge. After Soontir won the annual harvest festival race for the second year running, his father announced that he would retire to work in the department store, leaving the flying formally to Soontir. The fact that he had broken Agr regulations in letting unauthorized personnel use company equipment was later used against the family when Soontir accused Ilir Post of attempted rape.",
