 "content": "Marjaak was a male Keshiri Sith Saber in the Lost Tribe of Sith. By 44 ABY, he had joined the Tribe's armada as a crewmember of the Starstalker, under the command of Captain Vyn Holpur. Marjaak took part in the raid on the Fountain of Ancients on Klatooine, wherein he and fellow Sith Saber Anyul took samples of wintrium from the Fountain. They were attacked by Klatooinian guards and then by Hutts, and apprehended. Holpur and his entire crew, including Marjaak, were later sentenced to death for violating the Fountain.",
