 "content": "A clone was stationed in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center in the Galactic City on Coruscant.\nAround 21 BBY, when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised himself as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and infiltrated the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center to uncover a plot to abduct Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, this clone was working in the detention facility's cremation center along with three other clones.\nAfter the undercover Jedi along with prisoners Cad Bane and Moralo Eval started a prison riot in the mess hall, they managed to evade the prison guards and used the morgue to escape, hiding inside caskets which were sent to the cremation center. After the caskets arrived, the clones detected vital signs inside the caskets and started checking them. The prisoners then jumped out and began to attack them. This clone was tackled by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who could not bring himself to kill him, which resulted in the clone calling in for more reinforcements. Cad Bane then noticed the incident and shot the clone, scolding Obi-Wan for not killing him.",
