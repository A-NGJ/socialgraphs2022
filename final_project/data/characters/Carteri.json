 "content": "Carteri was a male Human operative of the Republic Strategic Information Service living during the Cold War. On Nar Shaddaa he was approached by Hunter and Mako, who he mistook for her identical sister Coral. Believing that he was dealing with a dangerous criminal, Carteri knew better than to try and outdraw her and simply handed to Mako the encrypted datapad she asked him for.\nCarteri appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic as an NPC on Nar Shaddaa, involved in Mako companion storyline.",
