 "content": "Allia was a female Twi'lek Pilgrims who lived on Tython illegally during the Cold War between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.\nA Twi'lek female, Allia was one of many Pilgrims who followed Matriarch Kolovish to the planet Tython in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War and the enslavement of Ryloth by the Hutt Cartels. Assisting in the establishment of Kalikori village, Allia was an advocate for Nalen Raloch and considered him a great hero of the village, defending the pilgrims from the Flesh Raiders. Allia and Keth aided Raloch in his hunt for the Fount of Rajivari, but eventually realized that Raloch himself had been corrupted by the knowledge he was seeking.\nAllia was originally a blue-skinned Twi'lek named Henni in early stages of the game, but her skin was changed to green and her name to Allia by the time of the game's release.",
