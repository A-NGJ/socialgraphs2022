 "content": "This stormtrooper was a male who was stationed onboard Freighter 2716 in 1 BBY, as part of a mission to transport a massive kyber crystal. When a group of rebels boarded the freighter, the stormtrooper, along with another, noticed a Theelin opening a crate door. He and his fellow trooper dragged the Theelin out and demand to know who let the prisoners out and where the other guards were, but were swiftly ambushed by the rebels – Saw Gerrera, Ezra Bridger, and Sabine Wren – who stunned them and added their bodies to those of the troopers already inside the crate. Soon after, the sabotaged freighter exploded, destroying it and the Star Destroyer it was to rendezvous with.",
