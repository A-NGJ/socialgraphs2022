 "content": "\"Big-Mouth\" was the nickname assumed by a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. He served as a clone corporal in the Grand Army of the Republic in the battalion under the leadership of Jedi General Depa Billaba. Big-Mouth was one of four survivors of the battalion when it suffered ninety percent casualties to Separatist General Grievous during the Battle of Haruun Kal. He and the other three survivors of her battalion, Commander \"Grey,\" Captain \"Styles,\" and Sergeant \"Soot\" joined her new battalion, and this unit included Billaba's Padawan, Caleb Dume, and clone trooper CT-1157, who would gain the nickname \"Stance.\"\n\"Big-Mouth\" was the nickname assumed by one of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on the planet Kamino to serve as a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Clone Corporal Big-Mouth was assigned to the command of the Jedi General Depa Billaba and fought alongside her on the planet Haruun Kal against forces led by the cyborg General Grievous, the Supreme Commander of the Droid Army. The battalion suffered ninety percent causalities, and all but four of the clone troopers serving with Billaba—Big-Mouth himself, Soot, Styles, and Grey—were killed. The Jedi herself was injured to the point that she fell into a coma.\nAfter six months, Billaba awoke and took the youngling Caleb Dume as her Padawan learner. The pair were assigned a mission to scout the planet Kardoa for Separatist activity and Clone Commander Gray re-gathered her four surviving colleagues to serve with her again including Big-Mouth, who held the rank of corporal. The commander also managed to have the veteran clones Lieutenant Remo and Corporals Mixx and Kaylon assigned to the battalion under Billaba's command, but was otherwise given inexperienced troopers fresh from Kamino to work with.\nGrey relayed this information the the Jedi and her Padawan in a briefing while they camped out on Kardoa's surface. The next morning the operation began and the Republic forces split into five squads to search the canyons of the world. Big-Mouth was part of a team led by Billaba that also included Dume and the clone trooper CT-1157—one of the new troopers whom Big-Mouth kept a close eye on. As they traveled Dume and CT-1157 began joking about the short leash that Billaba and Big-Mouth kept them on respectively, earning them disapproving looks from the general and the corporal.\nAs the pair joked, Billaba's squad came under attack from Separatist B1-series battle droids that had been waiting in ambush, and Billaba ordered Big-Mouth to contact the other squads and request air support. The corporal tried to comply, but found that their signals were being jammed by the Separatists and informed that general that no help was coming. Billaba then ordered Big-Mouth to remain with Dume and keep the battle droids occupied while she slipped away to find the Separatist's command ship. The clone did as ordered, but quickly realized that Dume was fighting too far out in front of the rest of the Republic forces, leaving him exposed.\nThe corporal tried to call the Padawan back, but was too late, as a series of blaster bolts struck Dume across the torso and knocked him to the floor. Ignoring Big-Mouth's orders to stay in cover, CT-1157 rushed out to defend his friend, destroying a trio of droids approaching the incapacitated Padawan. Billaba meanwhile had managed to locate the Separatist's shuttle and attacked it, causing the Separatist Colonel Coburn Sear to order a retreat off world so that his forces did not become stranded.\nThe battalion's next assignment was to the war-torn world of Mygeeto, where they were tasked with clearing the Southern Mesas of Separatist forces during the Third Battle of Mygeeto. Big-Mouth gave Dume one of his trademark meiloorun fruits before being assigned a squad to lead and setting out into the mesas. While he and his men were out in the field, Billaba, Grey, Styles, Dume and CT-1157, who now with the nickname Stance, returned to their camp after being rescued from battle droids by the Mandalorian Skull Squadron, only to be attacked again this time by Grievous and Sear.\nBig-Mouth and the other clones were called back for support, but before they arrived Sear managed to kill Stance, only to in turn be killed himself by Dume. Billaba sustained injuries while fighting Grievous, but was able to hold the cyborg off until the arriving reinforcements forced him to flee. Following the battle a burial service was held for stance and then the clones and Dume visited Billaba while she recovered in a bacta tank. Orders then came in for the battalion to head to the planet Kaller as soon as the general was battle ready.\nOn Kaller the Republic's forces engaged Separatist forces under the command of General Kleeve outside Plateau City, eventually routing them once they came close to the city walls. Kleeve and the remaining Separatist forces fled the planet, and after meeting with the Kalleran Gamut Key in Plateau City, Billaba ordered her men to set up camp for the night in the fields outside the city's walls. After Grievous ordered a major offensive, the Kaller system was again a target, so Billaba's battalion again fought battle droids, getting help from Clone Force 99. During the fighting, however, the battalion received Order 66, and Billaba was executed by soldiers who had known her for years.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, Big-Mouth stood 1.83 meters tall and had tan skin, brown eyes, and black hair. By the time he was deployed on Kardoa he supported a large beard, which unlike his hair, was gray. Big-Mouth was known for his habit of constantly eating meilooruns, often sharing them with his comrades and being able to procure them even on worlds where they were not naturally found. He was unhappy with the fact that many of the clones in Billaba's battalion on Kardoa were so inexperienced, believing they should have more training before entering the field. As such he kept one such clone, CT-1157, on a short leash during their deployment.\nBig-Mouth initially teased Dume for his relative inexperience, but when the Padawan took offense, the clone explained he meant no harm and offered the boy some of his meiloorun. After seeing Dume fight eagerly during the first fighting on Kaldoa, the corporal commented that the boy was doing well, but later had to unsuccessfully try and prevent him from being gunned down while fighting too far from his own troops. Big-Mouth and Dume formed a bond while fighting together on Kardoa, and afterwards frequently offered him meilooruns.\nBig-Mouth wore Phase II clone trooper armor with green markings on the helmet during the battle of Kardoa and carried a DC-15A blaster carbine.\nBig-Mouth was created by writer Greg Weisman and illustrator Pepe Larraz for the Star Wars: Kanan series of comic books and first appeared in the second issue on May 6, 2015. His initial appearance in the series, Kanan 2, showed his death, but later issues of the comic showed Big-Mouth's earlier actions in the Clone Wars prior to Order 66, including his growing friendship with Caleb Dume.\nHowever, Star Wars: The Bad Batch episode \"Aftermath\" depicted Order 66 on Kaller differently, with Big-Mouth not being mentioned. Being the more recent source, this article assumes \"Aftermath\" is correct. In Kanan 2, after darkness had set in, the clones sat around campfires in the fields, with Billaba sat with Dume, Styles and Grey. As they celebrated their victory over Kleeve, they received communication from Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, issuing Order 66, a command to execute all members of the Jedi Order. Despite their friendship with Dume and Billaba, the clones had no choice but to comply due to inhibitor chips implanted in them by the Kaminoans on Palpatine's orders. Big-Mouth and the rest of the battalion opened fire on the general and the Padawan, with Billaba killing Kaylon, Remo, and Mixx before Dume could even react. The boy then used his lightsaber to deflect blaster bolts back into Big-Mouth and Soot, killing them both. Styles and Grey soon managed to kill Billaba, but Dume escaped the clones and went into hiding.",
