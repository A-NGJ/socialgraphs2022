 "content": "Grapa was a human female Imperial officer who served as a lieutenant in the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Grapa served under the command of General Hurst Romodi and participated in a massacre of the rebel sympathizers known as the Amidalans. Within a couple months of the massacre, Grapa became associated with the resurgent criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn and her name was included on a list of infiltrators within the Empire that was discovered by the Sith Lord Darth Vader. A short time later, a group of assassins and Revengers that served Vader in search of the Crimson Dawn infiltrators, were sent to bring in Grapa. The group traveled to the astronomical object Tranchar in the Outer Rim Territories where they demanded Grapa be handed over and they would be on their way. One of the Revengers, Tanka, was not willing to walk away because the Imperials were torturing a group of individuals and insisted that the others do the same. The group then opened fire on the Imperials, though they were unable to kill Grapa due to the arrival of Vader, who questioned the lieutenant about the Amidalans. Grapa confirmed they had killed all of the Amidalans as they were rebels, before she was shot and killed by Tanka.",
