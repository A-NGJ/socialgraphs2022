 "content": "Kleiv, also known as Kleiv the Wanderer, was the name of a diseased vorantikus that lived in the Nightmare Lands of the planet Voss, prowling the Sha-Thes Meadow. It was slain around 3640 BBY.\nKleiv appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Voss. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by characters of both factions for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
