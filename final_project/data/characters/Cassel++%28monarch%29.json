 "content": "Cassel was a Pantoran male who served as the Monarch of the planet E'ronoh during the High Republic Era. He was often seen as unintelligent. Along with Thandeka, the queen consort of E'ronoh's twin planet, Eiram, Cassel was kidnapped by the Directorate in a plot to destabilize the governments of the area. When Lord Isamer, a Directorate leader, became angered at his lieutenants after discovering they had kidnapped Thandeka over the true queen of Eiram, Dima, Cassel spoke up, claiming Dima would still wish for her consort's return. Thandeka accused Cassel of attempting to ally with their kidnappers, and Cassel claimed to be arguing against Isamer's view of Thandeka being useless.\nWhen the Jedi came to save both hostages from their captors, Isamer managed to point his blaster at Thandeka, but before he could shoot and kill her Cassel threw himself into the line of fire, saving Thandeka's life but dying from the blaster wound.",
