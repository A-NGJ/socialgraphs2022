 "content": "Ocka Dwei was an advance scout for the Yuuzhan Vong, serving much the same purpose and function as Nom Anor, Yomin Carr, and various other clandestine operatives of the Praetorite Vong.\nAssigned to Coruscant sometime after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, he had become an expert in Coruscanti customs and spoke flawless Basic by the dawning of the New Republic. Disguised as a tall, dark-haired young man with a pudgy face, his true form was that of a tattooed and mutilated Yuuzhan Vong warrior.\nThree years before the invasion, Ocka Dwei discovered that the pollen of the bafforr tree had a toxic effect on vonduun crab armor, the traditional garb of a Yuuzhan Vong warrior. He began murdering employees of the Calocour Heights-based ad agency SchaumAssoc, whose marketing team had been given miniature bafforr cuttings as product samples from the Skydome Botanical Gardens. He was eventually ferreted out by freelance investigators, but killed himself rather than alert the alien infidels to his people's impending invasion.",
