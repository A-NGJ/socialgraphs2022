 "content": "CT-9538, nicknamed \"Edge,\" was a clone trooper who served in Tango Company.\nHe, along with the rest of Tango Company served on Geonosis, was afterword sent on a medical supply run to Ord Cestus. He served aboard a Republic supply ship that was under the command of Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee. He was infected with one of the Geonosian brain worms that had stowed aboard the ship, and was subsequently mind-controlled and forced to take over the ship. He also helped clone trooper Ox under the orders of Scythe to clear the bridge of the clone pilots. He then went on to attack the Jedi in the dining room, but he, along with Ox, were both knocked unconscious. Later, he and Scythe pinned down the final uninfected clone trooper on the ship and infected him with the brain worm. When Offee tried to reach the bridge, Edge shocked her as she walked through. But Edge, along with the rest of the crew, was sterilized when Ahsoka ruptured the cooling tanks.\nEdge had the Aurebesh letter Senth tattoed above his left eye. He carried a DC-15A blaster rifle, and a DC-15S. He as well was featured wearing a back pack. He wore Phase I Armor that had blue markings and bore a small striped sigil on his right chest plate that resembled a stylized tiger face.",
