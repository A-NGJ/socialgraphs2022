 "content": "Archiban Frodrick Kimble, better known as \"Doc\", was a Human male doctor who worked as a combat medic throughout the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, and later joined the crew of the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython as the Galactic War broke out between the two galactic powers. Born on the planet Ralltiir in 3670 BBY, Kimble attended Coruscant University's prestigious medical program on the Republic capital of Coruscant before graduating with high honors as a licensed xenopathologist. However, Kimble gave up the life of a doctor in the Core Worlds to bring medical care to the people of the Outer Rim, taking on the name \"Doc\" and traveling the galaxy for the next five years.\nDoc's escapades often saw him leave a trail of jilted lovers and furious criminals in his wake as Doc took it upon himself to right wrongs when he saw them, though after an encounter with a trio of crime lords on the planet Little Kessel, Doc joined the Balmorran resistance as an unofficial member and worked as a doctor as the resistance fighters battled the Empire's occupation of the planet Balmorra. When the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython came to Balmorra on a covert mission, Doc found himself helping the Knight and the Republic in securing a prototype cloaking device, and he decided to join the Jedi's crew when the Hero of Tython left Balmorra. Along with the Jedi's other allies, Doc aided the Hero's efforts to capture the Sith Emperor and then to prevent the Emperor from destroying the galaxy with a dark side ritual. After the Hero defeated the Emperor in a final battle, Doc and the other members of the Knight's crew were awarded the Cross of Glory, the Republic's highest honor.\nA Human male born on the planet Ralltiir in 3670 BBY, Archiban Frodrick Kimble grew up on Ralltiir during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, and he dreamed of being a heroic figure who would save the day and win against unimaginable odds. During the subsequent Cold War, Kimble gained the chance to attend the University of Coruscant on the Republic capital of Coruscant, and he enrolled in the university's medical school, the First Republic Medical Academy of Coruscant. While studying to be a doctor, Kimble encountered a fellow student with notoriously poor medical skills and intelligence, though the man's family wealth prevented him from being kicked out. Kimble began to specialize in xenopathology while also learning the skills of combat medicine, orthodontia, and other medical disciplines, and his classmates often complained that Kimble received favorable treatment from his female instructors. Despite the accusations, however, Kimble graduated with highest honors near the top of his class in record time by 3647 BBY, and surprised his teachers and classmates by disappearing to the Outer Rim Territories and offering his medical services to a wide variety of clients in the galaxy's most dangerous regions.\nTaking on the nickname \"Doc,\" Kimble traveled the Outer Rim for the next five years, bringing medical care to impoverished and dangerous star systems. During that time, Doc had encounters with a number of criminals and other unusual characters, including the disease-ridden crime lord Fashaka Four-Toes and the Rattataki anarchist and Hutt Cartel enforcer Kaliyo Djannis. Doc's romantic relationship with Djannis ended quickly, and another relationship with a woman named Lynlee on the planet Malastare ended when Doc left her behind without leaving her any credits to purchase passage on a shuttle off-planet. Doc soon became known for selling medical items ranging from trauma kits to entire hospitals, and a gang of criminals nicknamed him \"Doc Operator,\" though he earned their ire when he scammed them out of a large sum of credits and failed to deliver a promised shipment of spice. When Doc learned of a powerful Hutt who was hoarding medpacs after a powerful groundquake, Doc forged a death mark signed by the Hutt against a clan of Mandalorian warriors and helped the clan discover the false death mark. The Mandalorians promptly attacked the Hutt's palace, and Doc managed to recover the medpacs and a few rare gems from the palace in the chaos. Doc donated the medpacs to all of the hospitals in the disaster zone, an action that saved thousands of lives.\nDuring his travels, Doc spent a short amount of time practicing orthodontia on the planet Rodia, as well as a brief period impersonating a member of the Imperial Medical Corps on the Imperial-occupied planet Sullust, and had other adventures on planets such as Taris. Doc also worked with the organization known as the Red Band Rebels on the planet Cadinth for a time. In 3644 BBY, Doc encountered a Twi'lek doctor named Prudy on the planet Ord Mantell, and the two began a romantic relationship that soon resulted in their engagement. Doc even used the credits from his spice scam to purchase Prudy a hospital on the planet Alderaan, but Prudy's rushing of their wedding gave Doc cold feet and he left her at the altar. Around the same time, a trio of jealous crime lords on Ord Mantell supposedly placed a bounty on Doc, which some believed was the reason for his departure. However, Doc's adventuring and his obsession with undermining tyrants and despots across the galaxy came to end on the planet Little Kessel, where he crossed the Kaleesh warlord Xim'tahal the Defaced and was nearly killed as a result. After that encounter, Doc joined up with the Balmorran resistance on the planet Balmorra, where he aided the resistance fighters unofficially as a doctor in their fight against the Sith Empire.\nWhile the Balmorran Arms Factory was still under the control of the resistance, Doc ran a hospital within the weapons factory, becoming friends with various Balmorrans such as Remmy and Madel. However, the resistance was later driven out of the factory, forcing Doc to relocate his operations to a resistance hospital that had been established in an old research facility within the former genetic research compound known as Bugtown, where the Republic Military had established a forward command post as part of their renewed efforts to aid the resistance. Doc continued his efforts to heal the wounded, aiding resistance members, civilians, and soldiers, though he was the only trained doctor at the facility. However, the hospital's operations were disrupted when Imperial forces intercepted a shipment of trauma kits en route to the facility.\nNot long afterwards, the facility came under attack by a swarm of insectoid Colicoids, forcing Doc to send out a distress signal that was answered by the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython, who was responding to the signal in order to gain the trust of the resistance and therefore further the Jedi's own mission on Balmorra. The Jedi and a companion cut a path through the attacking Colicoids, but Doc alerted the pair to an incoming nest of Colicoids and warned the Jedi to close the insectoids' tunnels before racing to the secure area in order to protect his patients.\nDuring the Eternal Empire conquest, the Hero went missing and Doc believed that they had gone off on a top secret mission. Eventually, he became separated from Kira Carsen and Scourge on Begeren and started to look for Jedi in hopes of finding his former companions. His travels led him to Ossus and a hidden Jedi Colony under Jedi Master Gnost-Dural. Despite being a latecomer to the recently-established settlement, Doc was happily welcomed and joined as a full-time doctor of the staff.\nYears later, during the Invasion of Ossus and start of a new conflict between Empire and Republic, Doc and Nadia Grell led the evacuation efforts of the colony. He welcomed the arrival of the Eternal Alliance's Commander who had come to assist the evacuation.\nVoiced by Andrew Bowen, Archiban Frodrick Kimble is a companion character for the Jedi Knight class of Star Wars: The Old Republic. He can be romanced by the female Knight and can eventually be married to her.\nHall Hood, one of the primary writers for both the Jedi Knight and the Smuggler classes, stated that he designed the character of Doc to serve as a balancing effect for the seriousness of the Knight storyline. Hood's personal belief that humor was necessary for a good Star Wars story led to much of Doc's personality and in-game comments.\nIn 2018, Kimble made a return in the update \"Jedi Under Siege\" of the expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne. Upon completing the update, Jedi Knight class players have the option to welcome Kimble into the Eternal Alliance.",
