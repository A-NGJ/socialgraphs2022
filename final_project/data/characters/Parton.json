 "content": "Parton was a Human female who served as a yeoman with the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the era of the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, Yeoman Parton was present when the Alliance conducted an ambitious experiment to conceal its fleet within the chromosphere of the star Arbran by way of a protective field created by five Kerts-Bhrg field generators. After the experiment began, Parton accompanied Rebel leader Leia Organa back to Haven Base on the nearby planet Arbra aboard a shuttle. Per Organa's orders, Parton attempted to send a comm message to the Rebel freighter Millennium Falcon to recall her trusted friend Luke Skywalker to assist when an accident left the crew of the main Kerts-Bhrg generator unconscious. Skywalker could not be reached, but disaster was nonetheless averted.\nParton appeared in Star Wars 58, written by David Michelinie, illustrated by Walter Simonson and released in 1982. While the character is only referred to as \"Yeoman\" in dialogue, her name can be seen on a tag on the front of her uniform.",
