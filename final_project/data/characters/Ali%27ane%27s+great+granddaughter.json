 "content": "The Lupr'or Ali'ane had a great granddaughter who lived during the First Order-Resistance War. She possessed a necklace that was salvaged from an abandoned Lupr'or starship. Captain Phasma enlisted the girl's help in locating the Lupr'or starship in order to retrieve technology needed to attack the Tsw'ells guarding the R'ora stronghold. Phasma wanted to eliminate Lieutenant Sol Rivas since he was the only who knew that she had lowered Starkiller Base's shields, causing the superweapon's destruction.\nThis Lupr'or girl was the great granddaughter of Ali'ane, the oldest living Lupr'or who was born in the stars. The girl inherited a necklace from her grandmother, which was salvaged from an abandoned Lupr'or starship. After the First Order visitor Captain Phasma studied the R'ora stronghold, she grabbed Ali'ane and asked her where she got the necklace. The child led Phasma, the TIE fighter pilot TN-3465, and the Lupr'or guide Dar'en to the home of Ali'ane.\nThe girl introduced Ali'ane to Captain Phasma, who asked about the origins of the necklace. Ali'ane replied that she had obtained the necklace from the \"old world\". When Phasma asked where she could find more, Ali'ane replied that it was forbidden. At Phasma's prompting, the girl tried to convince her relative that Phasma had come to save them from the R'ora and the Tsw'ells. She added that Jair'i had said that the gods had sent Phasma to help them. Regarding technology as evil, Ali'ane refused to reveal the location of the ship.\nLater, the girl told Phasma that she was better at climbing rocks than her companion TN-3465. Phasma replied that she had seen a world similar to Luprora and that it was a hard life. The girl agreed to take Phasma to the ship if she did not inform Ali'ane. For several hours, the Lupr'or girl led Phasma, TN-3465, and Da'ren to the last Lupr'or ship, which rested on a cliff that had not been claimed by the sea.\nUsing the technology salvaged from the ship, Phasma led an attack on the R'ora stronghold. The Lupr'or electrocuted the Tsw'ells and rowed across the lake to the R'ora stronghold. While the Lupr'or battled the R'ora, Phasma took the opportunity to hunt down and kill Lieutenant Sol Rivas, concealing her role in the destruction of Starkiller Base. Having outlived their usefulness, Phasma then abandoned the Lupr'or to the R'ora and the rising sea levels.\nAli'ane's great granddaughter was a prepubescent Lupr'or girl with green skin, black hair, and gray eyes. She admired Captain Phasma, believing that she was a hero sent by the gods to deliver them from the R'ora and the Tsw'ells. Her trust and respect for Phasma led her to show her the location of the last Lupr'or ship. The girl wore a blue tunic, white trousers, and white scarf.\nAli'ane's great granddaughter first appeared in Star Wars: Captain Phasma, a 2017 four-issue comic published by Marvel Comics as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional material. She was created by Kelly Thompson, illustrated by Marco Checchetto, and colored by Andres Mossa.",
