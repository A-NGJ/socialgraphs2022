 "content": "At'raoth was a Shamed One trained by Nom Anor in his guise as Yu'shaa.\nShe was one of Nom Anor's select agents to attempt to infiltrate Supreme Overlord Shimrra's inner sanctum. She succeeded in reaching the antechamber with a villip disguised as a k'snell vase, but made it no further. Upon her failure, she triggered the irksh poison hidden in a false tooth at the back of her mouth. Against Nom Anor's plan and in defiance of Shimrra, Ai'traoth screamed Jeedai along with Ganner Rhysode's name as the poison quickly killed her. This served to show Shimrra just how quickly the Message of the Shamed Ones was growing.",
