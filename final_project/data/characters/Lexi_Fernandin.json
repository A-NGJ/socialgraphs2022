 "content": "Lexi Fernandin was an Human male explorer who ran Fernandin Scouting Expedition, a scouting company during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. After the Battle of Yavin he led a team to explore the Yavin system.\nLexi Fernandin was a male Human who founded his scouting company, Fernandin Scouting Expedition, during the expansion era of the Galactic Republic. By recruiting only the best scouts and explorers, Fernandin developed it into one of the finest independent scouting companies in the galaxy, with a reputation for excellence. They were often hired to discover new planets with raw materials or settlement potential by corporations. During the last years of the Republic, he scouted the planet Jedd Six. Fernandin was awarded several lucrative contracts within the borders of the Corporate Sector Authority, which kept his company in work for almost a decade before the Authority developed and deployed their own scouting teams.\nFernandin finally retired from field work to take an active role in the business side of the company, but found that, during its reign, the Galactic Empire put a heavy restriction on new exploration and no longer wanted to develop new civilian settlement opportunities. Over the course of around five years, Fernandin lost his best employees, who left his service for more lucrative work in the corporate or government sectors, education positions, or even freighter hauling. When permits for new exploration came through from the Empire for the Yavin system, Fernandin led the expedition himself in an effort to keep his company alive. Officially, the scouting was in preparation for colonization by Wetyin's Colony, but the Empire was using the company to ferret out the system's secrets.\nBy the time of the Galactic Civil War, Fernandin was a stout, middle-aged man with a thick, peppered beard. He had great enthusiasm for exploration and discovery and an optimistic attitude. With his company on the line, however, Fernandin overextended himself as he tried to prove that he still was a capable field scout.\nFernandin was trained to use a blaster, and his training as a scout meant he was proficient in survival and stealth techniques. He could pilot and repair a starship, and was skilled in understanding other languages.\nFernandin carried an identi-beacon, comlink, and survival pack, and armed himself with a blaster.\nLexi Fernandin was designed for inclusion in the first edition of Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin, a supplement to Star Wars Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games first in 1989 and then reprinted into a second edition in 1995.",
