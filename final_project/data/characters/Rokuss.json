 "content": "Rokuss was a male Gormak living on Voss during the Galactic War. In his youth, he saw his older brothers die in a battle against an off-worlder. After the Eternal Empire conquest of 3636 BBY, a Star Fortress was placed in orbit of Voss by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. The Gormak saw the Star Fortress as a source of the disease that affected their young, old and weak. In 3631 BBY the off-worlder who killed his brothers, now the Commander of the Alliance, arrived on Voss to take out the Star Fortress shield bunker. Rokuss recognized that the off-worlder who killed his kin had the most chance of destroying the Star Fortress and offered his assistance. He assembled a group of soldiers and joined the commander in assaulting and destroying the shield bunker. Rokuss then traveled to Odessen, where he formally joined the Alliance after the Star Fortress was destroyed.\nRokuss appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as a new companion for all classes, recruited through the Star Fortress series of missions.\nShould the player destroy the Star Fortress over Voss before starting Chapter I: Wrath and Ruin of the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, Rokuss will dispatch some of his Gormak to assist in the defense of Voss-Ka.",
