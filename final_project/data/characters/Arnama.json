 "content": "During the Galactic Civil War, Arnama was the chairman of the Plasma Energy Trade Commission and, as such, was considered to be among the most powerful people on Naboo.\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, a Zann Consortium strike team led by the Dathomiri witch Silri was sent to Naboo to intimidate Arnama. He gave in to the Consortium and would do as they commanded him. By controlling him, the Consortium was able to indirectly control the Plasma Energy Trade Commission, the most powerful group on the planet.",
