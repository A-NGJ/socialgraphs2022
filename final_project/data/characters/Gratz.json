 "content": "Gratz was a male Human forge master who operated the Gratz Foundry in the city Boneyard on the planet Nox. In 25,793 BBY, the darksiders Daegen Lok and Xesh escaped from imprisonment on the moon Bogan and made their way to the Gratz Foundry, to construct Forcesaber weapons for themselves. On arrival there, Lok performed a mind trick on Gratz that caused the forge master to believe that a pack of nashtah had entered his foundry and that if he stayed silent, the creatures would leave him alone. While Xesh utilized the foundry's facilities, Gratz sat crouched down on the floor in terror.",
