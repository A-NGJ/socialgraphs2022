 "content": "A hundred years after Reidi Artom surveyed the Cularin system, an expedition was mounted to visit Cularin's molten moon, Rennokk. Kum'Jushkin was a member of that expedition. The expedition found a metallic city in a gigantic cave, but was attacked by a lava worm. Kum'Jushkin was the only member of the party to escape, though the creature did manage to damage the ship. In retelling the story, Kum'Jushkin was often drunk, and his embellishments grew over the years. He was accused of making up the story to cover up an accident or his own incompetence.\nThe Living Force Campaign Guide describes in two places an expedition to Rennokk a hundred years after Reidi Artom. In both instances, the party was attacked by a lava creature, and there was one survivor—a reptilian humanoid—who nobody believed, but that survivor changed. In one instance, it was a Trandoshan named Tusskrek, and in the other, it was a Tarasin named Kum'Jushkin.",
