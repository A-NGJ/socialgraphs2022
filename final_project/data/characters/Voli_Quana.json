 "content": "Voli Quana was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Voli Quana was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Having constructed an amber-bladed lightsaber to wield against enemies of the Republic, Master Quana traveled the galaxy enforcing the Republic's laws.\nDuring her service to the Republic, she was assigned by the Jedi High Council to lead members of the Republican Army against the corrupt Governor Vrox of Mandalore. Joined by Commander Janx Ferro and a group of\nJU-9 Juggernaut War Droids, Governor Vrox led the Mandalorian Armed Forces against the Republican Army during the costly battle there. Master Quana served as support to Lieutenant Weirs during the battle, helping him communicating his commands to the army by use of her mastery of telepathy. While this strategy was extremely effective, Master Quana was forced to take control of the battle following the assassination of Lieutenant Weirs during an ambush. Under Master Quana's command, the Republic's Army were able to win the battle and capture Vrox.",
