 "content": "Dacholder was a Human male known to his friends as Doc. He was a member of the New Republic's Search and Rescue Corps.\nStill young and affable, but graying and balding early, he was assigned shortly after the Battle of Duro to partner with Uldir Lochett aboard the Pride of Thela; but he was also recruited by the Peace Brigade, and tasked with capturing the former Jedi academy student.\nWhen Dacholder's treachery became evident, Lochett calmly ejected him into space and fled the trap.",
