 "content": "An Imperial Human stormtrooper fought alongside another soldier, HJ-377, against a rebel group sometime before or during the year 1 BBY. After defending a hill for three months, the Imperial forces were running low on supplies and were fighting in hard conditions. At that time, explosions began to shake the ground, and HJ-377 went mad, thinking it was the rebels. However, it was in fact Imperial dropships coming to assist the Imperials by bringing reinforcements, ammunition, medical droids, and food. The stormtrooper later remarked that, although having witnessed many impressive things in life, the stormtrooper considered that dropship to be one of the greatest things.\nThe Imperial stormtrooper was first mentioned in the \"Imperial dropship\" entry in the in-game databank of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 versions of the LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, which was released in 2010.",
