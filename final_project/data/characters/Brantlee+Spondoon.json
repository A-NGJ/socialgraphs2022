 "content": "Brantlee Spondoon was a Human female who lived on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. She served as assistant to the Corellian Diktat Daclif Gallamby.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Brantlee Spondoon worked in the Capitol building of Coronet City as the aide to Diktat Daclif Gallamby, the head of state of the Corellian sector. As the assistant to the Diktat, her attributions included the organization of the agenda of the head of state and the approval of visitors requesting audience to the Diktat. Hence, she often used her advantageous position for her own benefit, requesting gifts and favors from such visitors. She thus obtained a Devaronian fur glosser from the Devaronian merchant Midgoss D'labaninaph and a container of Neonan red cheese from the businessman Zoda Burb.\nIn the meantime, Brantlee Spondoon acquired a female razor cat cub named Missy. However, In 1 ABY, the pet escaped her mistress and got away into the wilderness. Spondoon dispatched a spacer who soon brought back the beloved razor cat to her desperate mistress.\nIn 1 ABY, Brantlee Spondoon received word from an informant about a plot in motion to discredit the Diktat and his administration. She thus recruited a spacer who had previously worked for the Corellian government with Gallura Handerin. She tasked the spacer to meet with the informant in a warehouse in Coronet. However, when the spacer arrived in the warehouse, the informant was assassinated by a group of criminals made of former members of the Corellian Security Force, the Rogue CorSec. The spacer tried to recover the informant's hidden datadisk but was unable to do so. The spacer then reported the situation to Spondoon who was very disappointed and worried that the information was lost. Brantlee Spondoon ignored that the spacer was in fact working for CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper. Jasper and the spacer decided to investigate the Rogue CorSec, and were finally able to foil the plot against the Diktat.\nBrantlee Spondoon was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBrantlee Spondoon was present in the original release of the game. Like most quest giver NPCs in the earliest versions of the game, she proposed \"minor quests\" to the players. These quests did not provide any experience and just consisted in moving to a random location in order to kill or protect one or several NPCs. Brantlee Spondoon's minor quests were removed from the game with the release of the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, on November 1, 2005, since the characters was included in a new story arc, i.e., the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This questline was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the story arc was inserted into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
