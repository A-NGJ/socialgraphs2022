 "content": "This bounty hunter was employed by Jabba Desilijic Tiure in an attempt to execute Tyber Zann just before his prison break. Urai Fen killed him, while he sneaked past the hunter undetected using a cloaking device.\n\nIt is not known whether the bounty hunter is Mustafarian or Mandalorian, for while he is speaking to Tyber, a gray Mustafarian model is used, whereas, once he is dead, a gray 'dead' model is used wearing armor that looks much more Mandalorian than Mustafarian. To cause greater confusion, in coding, he is identified as Mandalorian. However given that the Mandalorians accepted many species into their ranks, the bounty hunter may be simply a Mustafarian Mandalorian.",
