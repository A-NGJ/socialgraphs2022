 "content": "Doune was a Herglic gambler who was involved in a dispute with Nyo and Kinnin Vo-Shay over credits. He had the lightsaber that a young Human, Nyo, wanted for his own. Having lost a game of sabacc with Vo-Shay over ownership of the lightsaber, he departed, leaving the lightsaber. Doune, however, parted with Kinnin's obsidian lucky charm, thinking that it contained the magical powers that contributed to Vo-Shay's success.\nLittle is known of Doune's early life, but at some point he learned how to play sabacc and acquired the droid Vee-Six.\nSomehow Doune found himself on the planet Morado, where he played sabacc, including with a farmboy by the name of Nyo, whom he left with one credit to his name. However, he was challenged by the master gambler Kinnin Vo-Shay at a hand of sabacc, who took pity on Nyo. Vo-Shay ultimately won nearly a quarter million credits from Doune; Doune suspected him of cheating. Doune hired the Barabel Yarrku to hunt down Vo-Shay's ship, the Ashanda Ray, and retrieve his lost money. Yarrku failed, so Doune bought the lightsaber that Nyo was seeking on Nar Shaddaa. Doune then challenged Vo-Shay to a round of sabacc: if Doune won, he would keep Vo-Shay's lucky charm. If Vo-Shay won, Doune would relinquish the lightsaber. At the Nygann Cantina on Nar Shaddaa, Vo-Shay lost and Doune won the charm. Doune, only wanting the pendant, left the lightsaber. Now that he had the obsidian charm, Doune felt confident on his future gambling career.\nDoune was an obsessive gambler, and apparently liked to pick on weak targets. He gambled often, and was also very superstitious. When he was agitated, his skin, like all Herglics, would mottle. He liked to think of himself as a victim when he lost, and took his anger out on his personal droid, Vee-Six.",
