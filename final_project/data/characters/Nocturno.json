 "content": "Nocturno was a female Human citizen of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. A former member of the Knights of Zakuul, she became known as the gladiator in the Arena Grand of Zakuul under the title \"The Fallen Knight\" by 3630 BBY. That year, Nocturno and her protege Drake Raven were put up against a newcomer known as \"the Mysterious Stranger\". During the fight in the Arena, Nocturno and Drake were assisted by G0-ON Attacker and G0-ON Abductor droids, but were defeated in the seventh round of the Arena fights.\nNocturno appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as the seventh boss of \"Eternal Championship\". She can be bought as a hologram for the player's stronghold as of Update 4.4.",
