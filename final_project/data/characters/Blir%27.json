 "content": "Blir' was a Balosar male who worked under the direction of Captain Ellin Lah as a pilot on the cargo ship Woebegone. He belonged to a group of traders who traveled through the Auril sector, where it supplied several worlds with seafood.\nIn the year 67 BBY, Blir and his comrades set out on a journey to Ithor after they realized a Muun hid as a stowaway on the Woebegone. The Muun was known to be Darth Plagueis and he ordered Blir and the crew to take him back to his homeworld. Blir and the crew rejected his offer, whereupon the Sith Lord was a tendency to forcibly take control of the spacecraft. Blir and all the crew members were killed by the Sith Lord.",
