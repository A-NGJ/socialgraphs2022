 "content": "Lucien Bender was a scientist and a criminal who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nLucien Bender was the father of Hraykken, Draykken, and Louis Bender. His torso and arms were cybernetic. A mad scientist, Lucien used to conduct experiments on his own sons. However, prior to the Battle of Yavin, the three young boys managed to escape their father with the help of a man who would later become the Meatlump King. The man and the three Bender brothers founded the Meatlumps, a gang of technology-hating thugs. In response, Lucien Bender created the Bofa Treat Gang.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Lucien Bender was still angered against his traitorous sons and placed a bounty on the three brothers. However, he ignored that a much larger bounty was placed on him and his gang. In 1 ABY, the bounty hunter Bossk localized Lucien in a bunker near the city of Kor Vella. The bounty hunter then captured Louis Bender. He intended to force his brothers Hraykken and Draykken to handle Lucien for him so he could collect the most substantial bounty. Bossk was keeping Louis in custody near Lucien's bunker when a spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps arrived to rescue Louis Bender. The bounty hunter revealed that it was not interested by the bounty on Louis' head and agreed with freeing the man upon Lucien would be killed. The spacer therefore attacked the Bofa Treat Gang and finally found Lucien in the depths of the bunker. The adventurer confronted the man and finally killed Lucien Bender.\nLucien Bender was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Lucien Bender was added to the game with the \"Game Update 10\", released on June 2, 2009.\nIn the CorSec Database H-Z, published on June 16, 2006, the three Bender brothers — Hraykken, Draykken and Louis — were originally described as the sons of the Meatlump King. However, when Lucien was added to the game, it was revealed that he was the father of the three boys who were at some point adopted by the Meatlump King.\nAnalysis of unused game files indicated that the three Bender brothers were intended to be named Lempi, Lucien and Hamm while the father should have been named Andrade. The game's files also contain an unused graphical model of a young Lucien. These files indicate that Lucien was originally slated to be the name of one of the brothers leading the gang. The brother Lucien eventually became Louis Bender.",
