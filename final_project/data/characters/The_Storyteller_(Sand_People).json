 "content": "The Storyteller was a male Tusken Raider, living in the Sand People's enclave outside Anchorhead on Tatooine, during the Jedi Civil War. He was particularly white dressed, which was unusual among the Sand People. He met Revan and told him the history of his tribe.\nIn 3956 BBY, Revan and the crew of the Ebon Hawk had snuck inside their enclave and managed to negotiate a deal with the Chieftain. While conversing Revan asked the Chieftain to tell the story of their tribe. However, he refused, stating that only the Storyteller was permitted to tell the history, and that only warriors were permitted to hear it. After the Jedi defeated a Krayt dragon and returned its pearl to the Chieftain as proof, he deemed Revan worthy and permitted him to hear the history, with a warning that speaking it in error would be considered blasphemy punishable by death.\nRevan then met the Storyteller, who began telling their history, with HK-47 translating. He stated that Tatooine had once been a green and lush world, but with the arrival of the Rakata and their Infinite Empire, his people had been suppressed. Many were kidnapped while other were forced to hide in caves. After the Rakata suffered a plague, however, the Sand People rose up against their invaders. Eventually the Rakata would leave and destroy the planet's surface, turning it into a desert.\nThe Sand People then became nomads, and new outsiders arrived to mine the ores in Tatooine's ground. The Tusken raiders, remembering the horrors of the Infinite Empire, proceeded to attack their new \"invaders\".\nIf the player already did the quest with the moisture-machines, he may bring a dragon pearl from a krayt dragon to the chieftain and then The Storyteller will appear, though the player can only talk with the Storyteller if he has HK-47 on his side as a companion. While talking, if the player ignores HK-47's warnings and attempts to contradict his story, they will be seen as committing blasphemy and the entire tribe will become hostile.",
