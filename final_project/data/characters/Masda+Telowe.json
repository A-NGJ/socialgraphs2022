 "content": "Masda was a Human female who claimed to be Arden Telowe's long-lost sister.\nSome time during the height of the New Order, Masda hired a group of scouts to help her locate Telowe in the deserts of Tatooine. In reality, Masda was Telowe's former wife, and was searching for him to exact a measure of revenge for leaving her. Masda was a native of Esseles, and claimed that Telowe had left her with a failing business and heavy debts. After the scouts agreed to help her, thinking that she was simply looking for her \"brother,\" Masda hired a group of bounty hunters to follow them into the desert, in order to ensure Telowe didn't escape.",
