 "content": "Coni-Co was the name given to a young wind-truster who was the personal mount of the Lew'elan Tonn-Glon. Luke Skywalker rode the wind-truster while attempting to circumvent the globe of Lew'el.\nIn The Legends of Luke Skywalker, Coni-Co is described as being scarlet: \" caressed the crest ridge of his scarlet mount and urged him to keep up.\" However, in J.G. Jones's chapter illustration, the wind-truster is depicted as a white bird.",
