 "content": "Red was the nickname of a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He was born and trained on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic as a clone commando during the Clone Wars. However, Red was killed during the war, which took place between 22 and 19 BBY. Along with many other clone commandos who had been killed in action, Red was later mourned by the Mandalorian training sergeants Kal Skirata and Walon Vau.\nLike his clone imprint, Jango Fett, Red was 1.83 meters tall.\nRed was first mentioned in Order 66, a novel written by Karen Traviss and published in 2009. Order 66 is the fourth and final novel in the Republic Commando series.",
