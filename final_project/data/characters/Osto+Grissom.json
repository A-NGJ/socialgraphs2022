 "content": "Osto Grissom was a male Human starship captain who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Grissom was spending the night at the Tyrena cantina in Tyrena on Corellia. When he left the cantina, he was attacked by Meatlumps. The technology-hating Meatlumps had picked him, because he transported electronics into and out of the Corellian system. Grissom however didn't know why they had attacked him and offered them some credits, which they ignored. The starship captain was lucky, as a large group of people left the cantina at this moment and scared the Meatlumps off.\nGrissom reported the incident to the Corellian Security Force and Major Walden tasked an independent agent with the investigations of the Meatlump attack. After questioning Grissom about the incident, the agent sought out camps of the Meatlumps outside of the city that led the agent to the Meatlump Cave. There the agent found the Meatlump lieutenant Ubbal Fenn who revealed the reason for the attack on Grissom. Grissom couldn't believe it when the agent told him about his findings.\nOsto Grissom was a Non-Player Character  in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Osto Grissom was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006. He could be found outside of the Tyrena cantina on Corellia. He was part of the quest \"CorSec Case Files: Assault and Battery\", which was a part of the Legacy quest, the longest quest line of the game.",
