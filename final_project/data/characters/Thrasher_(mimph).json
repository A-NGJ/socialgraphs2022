 "content": "Thrasher was a mimph who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor. Thrasher was missing a tooth, which had been lost in a fight. In 3 ABY, the mimph helped capture the Ewok Wicket Warrick and bring him back to the mimph village. After Warrick helped defeat the hanadak which had come to the village, Thrasher's tooth was given by a mimph hunting team leader to the Ewok to add to his Belt of Honor. Thrasher had pink-and-white fur and black eyes and wore orange clothing with a yellow belt.\nSmasher appeared in \"Gone With the Mimphs,\" the sixth episode of the second season of the animated series Ewoks. The episode was written by Linda Woolverton and aired on October 18, 1986.",
