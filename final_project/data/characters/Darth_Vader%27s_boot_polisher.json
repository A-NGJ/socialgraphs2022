 "content": "Darth Vader's boot polisher was a young man who aided Darth Vader in the Belderone sector. During a briefing with several of the officers that ruled over the sector, this man hovered around Vader's boots, attempting to polish them, even as the Dark Lord gestured wildly to his men. During a second meeting with the officers, the boot polisher was tasked with filling up drinks for the Imperials. It was here that he witnessed the death of General Andrid at Vader's hands.",
