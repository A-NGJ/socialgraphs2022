 "content": "Ars Dangor was a male human official who served on the Ruling Council of the Galactic Empire. During the Clone Wars, he served as a Senior Advisor of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine who sometimes acted as a bureaucrat, emissary, or a dignitary in Palpatine's name and one time accompanied Janus Greejatus, Sly Moore, Sate Pestage and Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic to Geonosis to oversee Poggle the Lesser's homecoming. As Poggle gave a speech to his fellow Geonosians, Dangor sat alongside the other Republic emissaries in the Petranaki Arena. During the speech, Dangor expressed worries to Krennic that he felt they could become appetizers at the drop of a hat.\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dangor served in the Imperial Ruling Council. As such, he was an adviser to Emperor Sheev Palpatine. He wore long, braided mustachios and had broad, furrowy eyebrows. Despite his mostly glum countenance, Dangor's unusual facial hair gave him a bit of Ã©lan. Like all the other members of the Imperial Ruling Council, he donned colorful robes and floppy hats.\nIn 5 BBY, he was on the guest list for a dinner party hosted by Perrin Fertha much to his wife Mon Mothma's annoyance as the day before he and Sly Moore had cut off the Ghorman shipping lanes which Mothma claimed would lead to mass starvation.\nArs Dangor was introduced to the Star Wars canon in James Luceno's 2014 novel Tarkin. The character was originally created for the Star Wars Legends short story \"Imperial Spin\" of the 1989 sourcebook Imperial Sourcebook.\nIn 2003, a production photo from five of the Advisors seen in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi was included in an article published on StarWars.com, accompanied by text that read \"Among the members of Palpatine's Inner Circle are: Sate Pestage, Janus Greejatus, Sim Aloo, Ars Dangor, and Kren Blista-Vanee\". Despite this, there is no canonical basis that proves that Dangor was one of the five advisors.",
