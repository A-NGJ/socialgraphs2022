 "content": "Gwishi was a Aqualish male pirate who held the rank of Strike in Kassav's Tempest within the Nihil. He had three eyes, having lost his lower right eye, with the area covered by blue scar tissue. Along with Klinith Da, Gwishi was sent to destroy the starship Steady Wing as it departed the outpost of Port Haileap. Whilst at Port Haileap, he posed as a mechanic, and wore orange coveralls. As Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh was boarding the starship with her charge Avon Starros and the protocol droid J-6, Gwishi was tinkering with an access panel next to the boarding ramp. Rwoh felt an alert sensation through the Force when she saw him, a sensation that felt \"spiky\" to her which she could not explain, although she attempted to brush it off and board the ship.",
