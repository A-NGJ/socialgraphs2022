 "content": "Ryzer was a Human male who frequented the cantina on Tansarii Point Station during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Considered a bully, the cantina owner Tiarsis asked a spacer to help her intimidate the man, as he was scaring away customers and making her feel uncomfortable.\nRyzer was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. In the game, his name was only seen as \"Cantina Bully.\" However, the game's creature database appeared to give him the full designation as \"Ryzer .\"",
