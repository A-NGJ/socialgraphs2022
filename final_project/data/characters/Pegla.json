 "content": "Pegla was a human male who worked for Zorby as a sentry at Zorby's Western Shiplot on the planet Ferrix during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He would sometimes do deals or trade favors with his friend Cassian Andor, allowing him to borrow one of the lot's ships for the night in 5 BBY. The next day, he found Andor changing out the ship's ID chip log and told him to leave and not return, refusing when Andor asked to borrow the ship again.\nPegla was a human male who worked as a sentry at Zorby's Western Shiplot on the planet Ferrix. The de facto head of security, he protected docked ships with a team of trained Corellian junkyard hounds. They kept out any trespassers, although Pegla occasionally looked the other way when Cassian Andor, a friend with who he made deals and traded favors, snuck into the yard.\nIn 5 BBY, he let Andor borrow a Breon Dayvan from the lot for the night. Unbeknown to Pegla, Andor then flew the vessel to the planet Morlana One to search for his sister, Kerri, but ended up killing two Preox-Morlana sentries there and having to flee. The next day Pegla brought two Corellian hounds out onto the lot on leashes and walked the security beasts to a pair of bones, stopping so they could begin to gnaw on them.\nAs the hounds ate, Pegla heard metallic rattling and looked up, seeing the vessel that Andor had borrowed back in the lot with the cabin door open. Glancing furtively over his shoulder, the sentry made his way over to the ship and was displeased to find Andor inside working on it. Glancing back again cautiously to the building where his boss, Zorby, was working, Pegla confronted Andor, who was not meant to be present while Zorby was in the office. Claiming he had forgotten something, Andor explained that he had refueled the vessel as asked and was nearly done, but Pegla spotted that Andor was changing out the ship's ID chip log for a blank one.\nZorby then contacted Pegla over the lot's PA system to ask what was happening, and Pegla used his comlink to respond, lying to his boss and claiming that there were rats in the yard again. As there was a customer out front, Zorby ordered Pegla to have the hounds deal with the situation and earn their keep.\nThe conversation with Zorby over, Pegla began questioning Andor about the chip log, worried he would get them both in trouble. Andor claimed that he had not liked how the ship was flying the night before and that he was leaving it better then he had found it, but Pegla was dubious that Andor was doing him a favor. When Andor, who was planning to flee Ferrix due to the murders he had committed, asked to borrow the ship again, Pegla refused and told him to finish up and then leave and not return. Andor tried to argue as Pegla walked away, but the sentry told him that he did not want to know anything about what was going on and that there would be no more deals or favors. He then whistled for the hounds and left. Later that night, as the local Time Grappler sounded the end of the day, Pegla dismissed the hounds to run off into the lot and the powered down the banks of lights throughout the yard.\nA scruffy and surly individual, Pegla finally ran out of patience with his friend Cassian's antics as he was tired of dealing with what he called the \"Cassian way\" and was not convinced that Andor was being honest and doing him a favor. Worried that he would get into trouble, he told Andor to leave for good. Pegla had light skin, brown eyes, and graying black hair.\nPegla wore a green duster coat with a brown satchel bag and belt. He also wore a brown aviator cap with a pair of goggles and black boots, using a pocket comlink to speak with Zorby.\nKieran O'Brien portrayed Pegla in the television series Andor, with the character first appearing in the first episode, which aired on September 21, 2022.",
