 "content": "Jaxxon's mother was a female Lepi from the planet Coachelle Prime. She was the mother of thirteen children, among them, the infamous smuggler Jaxxon. She attempted to instill a sense of family values in her young son, but he remained too rambunctious for her to control. At the age of twelve, Jaxxon stole a freighter, and headed for the Outer Rim.\nYears later, Jaxxon's sense for exaggeration would cause him to exclaim that his mother had produced eighty children during the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3's battle with the Behemoth from the World Below.",
