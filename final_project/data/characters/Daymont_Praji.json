 "content": "Daymont \"Veracity\" Praji was a Republic Naval officer during the Pius Dea Crusades. One of the Prajii of Kaikielius, by 11,660 BBY he commanded a fleet with the rank of Commodore.\nIn 11,660 BBY, during the Twelfth Pius Dea Crusade, Praji commanded the orbital bombardment of Zarracina III. The native Zarracines had resisted Pius Dea conquest and the Republic fleet retaliated by blasting the planet's surface into an irradiated wasteland.\nThe surviving Zarracines adopted a nomadic lifestyle and habored an eternal enmity against the Republic, which lingered as late as the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY, during the final months of fighting, several Zarracines aligned with the Confederacy of Independent Systems attempted to assassinate Daymont's distant descendant, Tannon Praji. However, they were thwarted by Ottegru Grey, his bodyguard.",
