 "content": "Norval was a dark-haired Human youth who studied Sith lore on Coruscant circa 39 BBY. When his professor, Murk Lundi, took a sabbatical to scour Kodai for a long-lost Sith holocron, Norval was disheartened to not accompany his mentor.\nDevising his own plan to obtain the artifact, Norval trailed Lundi to the planet, followed by another pupil, Omal. It was only Omal's bravery that prevented Norval from succeeding in his quest: once Lundi found the holocron, Omal's actions lost it in a deep geyser.\nLundi was imprisoned for ten years, eventually returning to Kodai in 29 BBY under the supervision of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. However, Norval acquired the holocron and fled before being found by the Jedi. He made his way to Lundi's native Ploo system, with the pair of Jedi on his heels. There, he would rendezvous with an agent of the Sith to deliver the holocron. Obi-Wan Kenobi boarded Norval's ship and confronted him. Norval briefly dueled Kenobi using a rudimentary lightsaber he had constructed, but was no match for the Jedi. Kenobi took the holocron and returned to his Padawan.\nThe Sith ship turned on Norval, with the intent to prevent the Jedi from recovering the holocron. Norval, once a bright, promising youth at the center of the galaxy, perished in a a hail of laser fire that obliterated his vessel.",
