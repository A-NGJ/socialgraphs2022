 "content": "Mitsurugi was a skilled swordsman from an unidentified world.\nMitsurugi traveled to the Cowl Crucible from a distant planet. There, on a mysterious planet, Mitsurugi faced off against Darth Vader as Yoda watched from the sidelines.\nMitsurugi sported a unique guise: a panoply of metal plates serving as armor, with clothing made of a soft fabric underneath. He also wore his hair in a ponytail held in place by a ribbon, and sported a short beard.\nMitsurugi's prowess as a swordsman was phenomenal, even by Darth Vader's standards, and was known to fight with a lightsaber-resilient blade made of an unidentified metal.\nMitsurugi was originally a character from the Soulcalibur series of video games, in which he is identified as a Japanese samurai. His first and only appearance in Star Wars media is the crossover comic book Star Wars: Visions of the Blade. He also appeared dueling against Darth Vader in the opening introduction to Soulcalibur IV and in the short film as well.",
