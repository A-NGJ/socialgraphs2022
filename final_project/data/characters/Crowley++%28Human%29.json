 "content": "Crowley was a Human female who served as a Master Sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic and later a member of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Clone Wars ended in 19 BBY, she settled on Sulon during the declaration of the New Order. By 1 BBY, she eventually joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic to battle against the Galactic Empire. She was one of the twenty-six Rebel resistance soldiers who fought with Morgan Katarn during Jerec's attack at the G-Tap. It was she who notified him about the arrival of an assault ship; Morgan recognised it as the same Correllian light freighter that attacked his farm.\nCrowley was possibly named after Dermot Crowley, the actor who played the Rebel general Crix Madine.",
