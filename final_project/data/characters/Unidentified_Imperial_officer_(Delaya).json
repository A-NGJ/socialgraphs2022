 "content": "An Imperial Officer was sent to the planet Delaya in 0 ABY to take Princess Leia Organa from a faction of Alderaanians who captured her. The Alderaanian faction brokered a deal with the Galactic Empire for a new planet to settle on after the destruction of Alderaan in exchange for the princess. However, the Imperial officer reneged on the deal and had the leaders of the faction killed by his stormtroopers and took Organa captive.",
