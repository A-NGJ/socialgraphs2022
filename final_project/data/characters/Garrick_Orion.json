He was one of the two founders of Nova Orion Industries, along with his old friend Jonas Nova. However, sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, they nearly split the organization due to their growing mutual suspicion and distrust.\nGarrick Orion appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
