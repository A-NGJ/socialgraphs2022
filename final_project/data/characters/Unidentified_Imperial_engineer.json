 "content": "A human individual served as an engineer in the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the engineer was present along with sixteen other engineers aboard an Imperial starship when its reactor was sabotaged by a Crimson Dawn mole. The sabotage left the engineers trapped abaord the vessel until they were rescued by Lieutenant Beilert Valance. After their rescue, the engineers were taken to an infirmary at Ryleel Imperial Base on the planet Carida. After Valance made his way into the infirmary, he was greeted by the engineers who thanked him for rescuing them, with this engineer noting that they thought they would not be able to get back to their family, but thanks to Valance they all had another chance.",
