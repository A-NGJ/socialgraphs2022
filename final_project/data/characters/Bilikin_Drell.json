 "content": "Bilikin Drell was a Human male who worked as a slicer during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Drell made a deal with Tarro Blood to steal the Great Hunt's target list and sell the names to the highest bidders in the galaxy. After Blood gave him the codes to break in, Bilikin was able to retrieve the list and held an auction on Nal Hutta. However, the competition's assistant Huntsmaster, Lek, was able to send an unidentified bounty hunter to retrieve the list and kill Drell. After a deadly fight, Drell begged the bounty hunter to spare him and promised that he would never speak the list again, but the hunter killed him for making a deal with Blood.",
