 "content": "Varko was a male Selkath who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He spent several years learning galactic basic, and eventually became a immigration officer. During his job Darth Arkous was accepted past immigration. Two days later, a Republic citizen named Tev Fith landed on Manaan who claimed he did research in biotech, but he had no permit that allowed him to bypass the Order of Shasa's law of offworlders not being allowed to travel two hundred meters distance or fifty meters depth from the Mercantile Plaza. Just as his shift was about to end, Lana Beniko, who was after Darth Arkous used a mind trick to bypass immigration.",
