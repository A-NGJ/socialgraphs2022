 "content": "\"Gold Four\" was a human male pilot who flew in Gold Squadron in the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. In 2 BBY, he and his fellow pilots escorted Senator Mon Mothma's shuttle Chandrila Mistress into hiding. After rendezvousing with the Spectres rebel cell's starship Ghost, the rebels traveled through the dangerous Archeon pass. During the journey, Gold Four and his comrade Gold Three were shot down by an Imperial TIE Defender.\nGold Four was a member of Gold Squadron, which flew Y-wings as part of the rebellion. In 2 BBY, Gold Four and his fellow Gold Squadron fliers escorted Senator Mon Mothma's shuttle Chandrila Mistress into hiding. Mothma had incurred the wrath of the Galactic Empire by denouncing the Emperor's role in the Ghorman Massacre. Gold Four and his fellow pilots rendezvoused with the Spectres in deep space.\nGold Four and his fellow pilots refueled their Y-wings with the Spectres' starship Ghost. Gold Squadron, who were joined by the Spectres rebel Ezra Bridger, then took part in a brief dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters and an Arquitens-class command cruiser. Gold Squadron disabled the light cruiser with ion cannons before bombing the ship. At the advice of the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla, the rebels then traveled through the Archeon Nebula in order to reach Dantooine where Mon Mothma planned to attend an important meeting.\nWhile traveling through the Archeon pass, the rebel convoy was pursued by a TIE Defender piloted by Commander Vult Skerris and two TIE interceptors. Gold Leader Jon Vander sent Gold Four and Gold Three to intercept the Imperial fighters. However, Skerris quickly destroyed both starfighters. Following a skirmish, the rebels and Mon Mothma managed to reach Dantooine where they formed the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nGold Four was a rebel starfighter pilot who flew a Y-wing starfighter as part of Gold Squadron. He had blue eyes, brown hair, and fair skin. Gold Four was a competent pilot but was no match for Vult Skerris' TIE Defender.\nGold Four first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Three episode \"Secret Cargo\", which premiered on March 4, 2017. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who also voiced Admiral Kassius Konstantine and the Clone troopers.",
