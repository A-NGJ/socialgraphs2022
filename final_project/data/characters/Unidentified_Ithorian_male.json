 "content": "A male Ithorian with light blue eyes and light gray and yellow skin lived in the South Apartments of the Upper City on the planet Taris during the Jedi Civil War, in 3956 BBY.\nSometime after the attack on the Endar Spire in the space above Taris, an amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith known as Revan was marooned on the planet. During his exploration of the area, Revan forced his way into the man's apartment and scared him. The Ithorian begged Revan not to hurt him and claimed that he had nothing of value to steal.\nThis character appears in the 2003 role-playing game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, released for the PC and Xbox by LucasArts and developed by BioWare. The player can meet this character during the beginning of the game, after escaping the Endar Spire, by picking or bashing the lock on his apartment door. His apartment contains a bag with random loot in it and although he begs you not to harm him, he can not be attacked. The game interface lists his name only as \"Ithorian.\"",
