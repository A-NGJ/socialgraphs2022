 "content": "This male Arkanian offshoot lived at some point between the Great Sith War and the Mandalorian Wars. He was a medical student and became involved as a researcher in the project of Antos Wyrick, a Zeltron Mandalorian scientist, who sought to create Force-sensitive children at his school on the planet Osadia. Using genetic material of the Arkanian Jedi Master Arca Jeth, the researchers attempted to modify children in vitro to enhance them with Force-sensitivity. The man and his wife, another researcher, became the parents of the first child, a daughter named Edessa, which meant \"triumph\" in Arkanian. However, several years later the school was attacked by Skyreaper drones of a slaver organization known as the Crucible, and all children there, including young Edessa, were taken captive.",
