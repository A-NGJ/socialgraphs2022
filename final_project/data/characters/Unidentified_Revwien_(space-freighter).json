 "content": "This individual was a member of the Revwien species. It had purple skin. It was present in a space-freighter's hangout in 1 ABY at which time Han Solo was engaged in a bar-brawl. Following this, the local schoolboy Berd Lin burst in, recruiting many of patrons in an effort to rescue his mother from Imperial forces arresting her on the planet Harix.\nThis individual appeared in the background of Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures 7, which republished Bring Me the Children, originally a newspaper comic strips by Russ Manning that had been published by Los Angeles Times Syndicate in 1980. The Revwien in this scene was not actually present in the original newspaper strip, but was added to the panel to make it better fit a comic book rather than newspaper format.",
