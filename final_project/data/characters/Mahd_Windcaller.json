 "content": "A blond-haired woman, Mahd Windcaller was part of the Interim Ruling Council.\nKnown for being a manipulative schemer, Mahd Windcaller was the head of an extensive news agency and had been a supporter of the Galactic Empire since its beginning. Her news agency was used as an intelligence source for the Empire. She was also skilled in the art of Echani and was the head of a group of women bodyguards who were also dedicated to the art.\nMahd was one of the founders of Carnor Jax's plan to sabotage Palpatine's clones. After the Emperor's death, she became a member of Jax's Interim Ruling Council. A very open-minded Imperial, she made friends with several of the nonhumans on the council including Norym Kim. Mahd was imprisoned by Xandel Carivus when he disbanded the council to rule as Emperor.\nFollowing Carivus' death, Mahd and the other arrested councilpersons were taken into custody by the New Republic.\nThe appearance of Mahd Windcaller was based on that of Lucy Autrey Wilson, Director of Publishing for Lucasfilm.",
