 "content": "Commander Surlev was the second-in-command of the Strike-class medium cruiser Ion Storm under Captain Barse Neomen. Surlev acted as the commanding officer of the Ion Storm whenever his captain was away, which was quite often. However, as a result of Surlev being extremely loyal to Governor Newen Streeg and Captain Neomen being very disloyal, the captain kept Surlev on a very short leash. Surlev was very dedicated to the idea of cleaning up the Sisar Run, where he was stationed.",
