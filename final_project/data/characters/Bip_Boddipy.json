 "content": "Bip Boddipy was a Human male who was active during the Clone Wars. He was known to be a kidnapper and a murderer.\nLiving on Tatooine, Bip started his life as a criminal and began to wonder throughout the galaxy, committing terrible crimes by kidnapping and murdering. He was later captured by the Galactic Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on M'Bardi and would be shipped to Coruscant. While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Bip and several prisoners were reluctant at first to cooperate with the Jedi until they decided in repairing the ship. Moving safely through Republic space, Skywalker thanked Blank and the prisoners for helping and guaranteed that their aid will affect their parole.",
