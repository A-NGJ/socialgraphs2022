 "content": "Dalia was a Human male who served as a First Sergeant and a GeNode, and for a brief time, stormtrooper. He was known for his bravery and excellent skill with a blaster. Shortly before the Imperial occupation of Kashyyyk, he was dispatched to Janzor's platoon. Sergeant Dalia led the charge on the Wookiee outpost, skillfully dodging blaster fire and advancing on the enemy. However, the Wookiees ambushed his group later in the day, and he died in the subsequent battle.",
