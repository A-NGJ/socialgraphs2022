 "content": "Oggo was a male Zabrak leader of the Starbolts crime syndicate based on Asylum. Oggo and his rival Tanno Vik of the Blast Crew syndicate disagreed over the control of the Free Zone black market, settling their dispute with blasters. In 3631 BBY Oggo was unexpectedly killed by HK-55 and the Commander, allowing Vik to takeover the Free Zone, though his reign was short-lived, as Asylum was attacked by the Eternal Fleet shortly afterwards.\nOggo appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 6: Asylum and is voiced by Erik Todd Dellums.",
