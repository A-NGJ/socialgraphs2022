 "content": "Nhego Roolan was an Aqualish criminal who was active during the Galactic Civil War. At some point after Battle of Yavin, he bribed Tusken Raiders to steal contraband from Jabba. He was opposed by Saponza's Gang acting on behalf of Kada, the head of security of Jabba the Hutt .\nNhego Roolan was a dark and brooding individual, and often hard to track down. His interests lied mostly in personal acquisition of power and credits.\nNhego Roolan appears in the 2014 Canon mobile game Star Wars: Commander.",
