 "content": "Rulo was a male Rodian who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nAfter being discovered as Force-sensitive, Rulo was trained at one of the Jedi Order's academies in the ways of the Force; eventually ascending to the rank of Jedi Knight. Assigned to the experimental academy on Almas, Jedi Rulo selected as his Padawan the Human, Lo Pelkar. The team worked out of the academy together, accepting missions from the Almas Council that were nearly exclusively related to activity in the Cularin system.\nIn 31 BBY, Jedi Rulo and Padawan Pelkar were dispatched to investigate the mass kaluthin-kill. Kaluthin, an oxygen-giving growth that kept Almas habitable, was quickly dying around the planet from unnatural causes. Their search brought them to a local bar called Building 49-A where they discovered the local belief was that the Jedi were responsible. Biting their tongues, the Jedi were able to track down the true culprits: the Dark Jedi Kosa-Yin Hadu and Gar Granga. After engaging the two Dark Jedi, Rulo and Pelkar were able to subdue their enemy and end the crisis.",
