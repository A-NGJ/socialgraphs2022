 "content": "Orrin was a male Neimoidian ally of the CIS during the Clone Wars. He was convinced by the prince Yojan from Simocadia to sponsor the operation of excavating and reactivating an Ardana Shadex - an ancient stone giant build by a mysterious Simocadian race. Orrin complained a lot about the expense of the project and demanded results, but when the giant was about to be activated, Jedi Master Mace Windu arrived and attempted to stop Yojan by destroying the glass key that controlled it. However, this only made the giant went out of control and crush everything in its path. Orrin and the other beings present escaped the Ardana Shadex in the Neimoidian's Sheathipede-class transport shuttle and eventually Windu and Yojan decided to join their forces to disable the giant together.",
