 "content": "Wordro was a Hutt male whose shipments were hijacked during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nAround 3643 BBY, an individual associated with one of the two rival governments sent a companion of theirs to protect a delivery in return for Wordro giving them a share of his profits. The companion fought of the hijackers and exposed a traitor within Wordro's organization. Pleased, Wordro gave them a bonus.\nWordro the Hutt was mentioned in the Crew Skill mission \"Hijacker Ambush\" in the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
