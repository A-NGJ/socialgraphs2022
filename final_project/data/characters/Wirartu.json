 "content": "Wirartu was a Kerritamba Wookiee, the former Arena Champion. When a village individual completed tasks to help Chief Kerritamba, though, Wirartu became very angered, because he thought that he should have been the one to be honored by completing these tasks. He challenged that village individual to a battle in the arena, which Wirartu lost. That village individual became the new Arena Champion.\nWirartu was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
