 "content": "Gosden was a captain in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War fought between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He served aboard the Empire's DS-1 Orbital Battle Station at some point prior to its destruction in the Battle of Yavin.\nA Human male, Gosden stood at a height of 1.8 meters. He considered serving the Imperial New Order his highest goal. Gosden had knowledge with bureaucracy and technical proficiency in security. He was equipped with a blaster pistol and a comlink and wore the standard Imperial officer's uniform with a rank insignia plaque, a cap, and an Imperial officer's disc.\nGosden was created in 1989 for the first edition of the West End Games sourcebook Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope, a supplement written for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. The image used to represent Gosden was later used to represent a different Imperial officer, Lieutenant Venka, in the first edition of Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back, which was another West End Games sourcebook released in the same year.",
