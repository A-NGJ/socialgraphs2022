 "content": "Cipiter was a male Chev, who was a slave to his Chevin master Nunk Plaarvin, and a member of the Raff Syndicate. He organized auctions on Metellos 3 for his master, when Marn Hierogryph, under alias of \"Professor Gryphomarn\", tried to run a con there, using Jarael and Rohlan Dyre as his accomplices. Plaarvin, however, had cracked the con and had Jarael and Rohlan captured and prepared for execution. Cipiter expressed his deep regret before Jarael, but admitted that as Chev slave he could not disobey his master. Later that day Marn Hierogryph and his accomplice Zayne Carrick attempted another conâ€”this time in an attempt to save their friends. Disguising Slyssk as a Raff Syndicate representative, they fooled Plaarvin into thinking that the Syndicate knows about him hiding part of his profits from them. After that they send him to a \"rendezvous\" with Syndycate on the planet Jebble, which, unknown to Plaarvin, was devastated several months ago. Pointing to Cipiter and other Chevs that they were now free, Hierogryph suggested them to keep running operations for Syndicate, to which they agreed.",
