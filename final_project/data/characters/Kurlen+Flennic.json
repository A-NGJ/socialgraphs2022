 "content": "Kurlen Flennic was the male human politician who served as Moff of Yaga Minor. He was appointed to that position by Emperor Palpatine of the Old Empire himself, and was still a Moff as of the signing of the Pellaeonâ€“Gavrisom Treaty in 19 ABY.\nAfter the arrest of Grand Moff Disra, Flennic became the main voice of the 'old guard' faction of the Council. In this regard, he was in opposition to Moff Sarreti  and Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, who advocated for a more progressive stance on foreign and domestic affairs.\nFlennic retained his post until at least the Yuuzhan Vong War. During that time, he became so frustrated with Pellaeon's tactics that he came close to assassinating the Supreme Commander with a blaster. However, his aim was spoiled by a Force nudge from Mara Jade Skywalker and the blaster bolt went harmlessly over Pellaeon's shoulder. After Flennic was taken into custody, Pellaeon agreed to overlook the attempt on his life as caused by the stresses of war, and allow the Moff to retain his post and his freedom, if he submitted to the Grand Admiral's proposals.\nHe was beneficial in driving back the Yuuzhan Vong during the battle of Yaga Minor, through the use of his sector fleet. Flennic held off the Yuuzhan Vong forces long enough until Pellaeon's reinforcements arrived, at which time B'shith Vorrik retreated.",
