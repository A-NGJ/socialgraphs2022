 "content": "Tebbi was a female Lepi with soft white fur and pink-tipped ears. She was the daughter of Heff, one of only three surviving members of the original colony ships to settle Tatooine in the early years of the Galactic Empire. Tebbi was a Rebel sympathizer, and when her father was killed by the bounty hunter Jodo Kast, who was hunting Adar Tallon, she shared what she knew with a group of Rebel agents who were also seeking Tallon.\nA couple of seasons later, Tebbi sold her father's shop, Heff's Souvenirs, to the Sullustan Moplin Jarron.\nTebbi was described in Tatooine Manhunt as a \"rabbit-like alien\". The name \"Heff\" was later used in the The Starhoppers of Aduba-3 article as an example of a Lepi name, establishing him and his daughter as Lepi.",
