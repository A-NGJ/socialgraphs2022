 "content": "Slish Fondine was a male Human who owned a blob corral on Umgul.\nIn 11 ABY he learned through Lando Calrissian that the consort of the Duchess of Dargul had been using one of his blobs to cheat and earn credits to obtain transport away from Umgul. Slish had wanted to have Dack executed, since cheating in blob racing was a capital crime on that world, but refrained when Calrissian said that such an act could start an inter-system war between Umgul and Dargul. He was later rewarded with a track that was, ironically, named the Dack Track by the Duchess Mistal.",
