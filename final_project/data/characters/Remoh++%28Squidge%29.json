 "content": "Remoh was a male Squidge and the den-brother of Otalp who lived long after the death of Luke Skywalker. His species was being oppressed by the Vindar.\nWhen Otalp heard his den-mother speak of a vision she had, he set out in search of the storyteller. Remoh, though skeptical of the tale's veracity, followed, believing that even some hope was better than none. After a long journey, they found the storyteller, broken down and inactive, in a cave. After they reactivated him, the droid told them a tale of a hero who led the fight against a dark oppressor and brought hope to the galaxy. When Vindar discovered the cave, Otalp told Remoh to hide and was killed by the Vindar, who also shot C-3PO. In the droid's wreckage, Remoh found a lightsaber, and determined to use it to bring freedom to his people.\nThe names of Otalp and his brother Remoh are ananyms of Plato and Homer respectively. Both Plato and Homer were figures of ancient Greece.",
