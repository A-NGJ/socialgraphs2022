 "content": "Leb Chura was a male green Twi'lek pilot who was hired to pilot a shuttle that delivered six construction droids, dry-lining materials and Chief Scientist Ko Sai to the planet Dorumaa. During their hunt for Ko Sai, Kal Skirata along with Walon Vau and Mereel interrogated Chura on Mong'tar City about the job. After getting the information, Skirata rewarded him with a credit chip.\nA day later, he was again interrogated on Kerif City by Jedi General Bardan Jusik and Delta Squad who were also after Ko Sai. His memories of the job were then erased by Jusik to prevent anyone from getting the information again.",
