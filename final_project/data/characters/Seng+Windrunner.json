 "content": "Seng Windrunner was a male Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 21 BBY, Windrunner became the leader of the Talons, a swoop gang that operated on the planet of Cularin. During the time of the Clone Wars, the Talons entered themselves in the Cularin Classic swoop race, and Windrunner hired the Twi'lek investigator Di'hal'uma to look into the backgrounds of the other teams participating in the race. He traveled to meet with Di'hal'uma in the Dancing Flame Tavern in the city of Gadrin, but when he arrived, the Twi'lek was not there, and he learned that a group of thugs had attempted to capture her. Windrunner returned to Landing Bay 216, the Talons' base of operations, and spoke to the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who were investigating the attack on Di'hal'uma.",
