 "content": "Hohn Ryntz was a male Caarite, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nRyntz worked for the Metatheran Cartel, as an internal audit clerk. In about 32 BBY, he was tasked by Velin Wir, the Cartel's envoy to the Cularin system, to place a bounty on the heroes of Cularin. However, following the death of Wir, he forgot to cancel the bounty.\nFollowing the reappearance of the Cularin system just over ten years later, various bounty hunters became interested in the contract, which, due to compound interest, was now valued at half a million credits. Ryntz felt indebted to the heroes, as they had prevented the release of a deadly virus on the Caarite homeworld, and he wanted to avoid a PR scandal for the Cartel, so he tried to track them down and warn them. He found them on the moon Nar Shaddaa, where he told them about the bounty and attempted to contact the Hutts, so that he could cancel the contract.",
