 "content": "This stormtrooper served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire. Stationed on Lothal, he was guarding the entrance of the Imperial Complex during the Siege of Lothal. While on duty, he intercepted Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, who were disguised as a stormtrooper and a cadet respectively, and bringing in a cart holding crates in which the rest of the Spectres were hiding. When the stormtrooper stated he had to check inside the crates due to the lockdown, Ezra attempted to mind trick him into not checking the crates, but failed. At that point, Kanan stepped in and mind tricked the trooper himself, and the two rebels were allowed to pass.\nThe stormtrooper is voiced by Steve Blum, who also voiced the Lasat character Garazeb Orrelios.",
