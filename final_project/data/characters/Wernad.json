 "content": "Wernad was a Trandoshan male who lived on Jedha. At some point during the Galactic Empire's occupation of Jedha, Wernad and his clutchmates were forced to work in the kyber crystal mines. After his clutchmates died in the mines, Wernad was overcome with grief and anger, and he decided to exact revenge on the Imperials. To achieve this, he went to the Temple of the Kyber and claimed to be a Jedi in hopes of rallying people behind him and starting a violent uprising. However, Guardian of the Whills Chirrut ÃŽmwe saw through the Trandoshan's false claim and convinced him that hurting more innocents was not the answer.",
