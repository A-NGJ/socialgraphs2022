 "content": "Krael was a dim-witted male Human who worked for the Twi'lek crime lord Ilb Toranda during the Clone Wars. Circa 21 BBY, Toranda dispacted Krael and the Rodian Vreego to purchase some illigal weapons from a women in the city Hedrett on the planet Cularin. The pair traveled through the sewers of Hedrett while on their way to meet with the women and en route, Vreego gained the impression that Krael was a liability to Toranda's organization, so the Rodian killed him. The Twi'lek bounty hunter Caranna later spotted Krael's decaying corpse in the sewers after she traveled there while fleeing from her rival Tendin Vought.",
