 "content": "Caleb Clancy was a male Human, who worked as a security guard on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nClancy worked as a security guard for the pharmaceutical company Culpharm and normally carried out his duties in a processing plant on the planet Cularin. He lived in an apartment complex with his wife and children.\nIn about 31 BBY, Clancy and his family attended a picnic that was organized by the Paradise Towers' Residents Social Association and he operated a barbecue there. He disliked the picnic and considered it a waste of his day off work and only attended because his wife had wanted him to. While he was there, an agent working for Biotherapy, a rival company of Culpharm, posed as Clancy to steal a Culpharm specimen sample. The next day, the Heroes of Cularin, who were investigating the theft of the sample, asked Clancy a few questions.\nClancy was asocial and disliked dealing with people, so was generally suspicious of strangers. He was also very grumpy. He was small and had blond-colored hair.\nCaleb Clancy appeared in Mix and Match.",
