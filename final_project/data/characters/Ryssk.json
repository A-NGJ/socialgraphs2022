 "content": "Ryssk was a Trandoshan scout and pilot who was active during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Ryssk worked for the Hutt Mika Anjiliac Chiera, hunting spacers who were opposed to Mika's business operations.\nThe Trandoshan Ryssk lived and operated as a scout in the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign. A capable pilot who carried several weapons, Ryssk was hired by the Hutt crime lord Mika Anjiliac Chiera to pursue spacers who had learned that Mika was controlling the distribution of tempest spice to the galaxy. The scout often appeared before the targets while they were at a disadvantage, particularly when those spacers were already involved in combat with a third party.\nConsidered a capable scout, Ryssk was an apt pilot, navigator, slicer and mechanic. Ryssk was also proficient in stealth and demolitions. The scout was bilingual, capable of speaking Dosh as well as Galactic Basic Standard.\nRyssk utilized a Z-95 Headhunter with a class 1x hyperdrive. The Trandoshan was also equipped with a stun baton, an ion rifle, and a selection of grenades that included fragmentation grenades, stun grenades, and thermal detonators.\nWhile statistics for Ryssk appear in the first appendix of Tempest Feud, an adventure published for Wizards of the Coast's roleplaying game in early 2002, Ryssk is not used during the normal outline of the adventure. Instead, Ryssk is only hired if the players deviate from the main outline of the adventure and determine that Mika is the spicelord manufacturing tempest prior to Act III. Tempest Feud is written to take place during any era. However, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published near the end of 2008, establishes that Mika Anjiliac Chiera produced tempest spice during the early years of the New Order.\nRyssk's gender is not provided in Tempest Feud.",
