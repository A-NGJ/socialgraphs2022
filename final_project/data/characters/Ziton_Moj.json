 "content": "Ziton Moj was a male Falleen who worked as a Vigo for the Black Sun during the Clone Wars. He served as Captain of the Guard, however later, the Black Sun became a member of Maul's Shadow Collective after Savage Opress, Maul's brother, killed the leaders of Black Sun for refusing to join Maul's cause. Due to this, Moj became the subsequent leader of the Black Sun, and as a member of the Shadow Collective, Moj fought during the Death Watch coup on Mandalore to help further the Shadow Collective's goals.\nAs a leader of Black Sun, Ziton attempted to force the Pyke Syndicate's leader Marg Krim to merge their two syndicates. When Krim refused, Ziton kidnapped Krim's family in an effort to force Krim to reconsider his decision. Ziton kept Krim's wife Tezzka Krim and their children Vram and Laalee hostage at the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar. However, the bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos rescued Krim's family and returned them to their father. In retaliation, the Black Sun sent a fleet to attack the Pyke Syndicate's stronghold on Oba Diah.\nAfter Maul was released from the Spire, the Shadow Collective reemerged fully, and Moj helped fight in the battle on Ord Mantell against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, before pulling Black Sun out of the Collective during the Second Battle of Dathomir. However, he and Black Sun later rejoined, as did the Pykes. During the Siege of Mandalore he, Pyke leader Marg Krim, and Dryden Vos of Crimson Dawn were ordered to go into hiding by Maul.\nIn 19 BBY, former Sith Lord Maul, Savage Opress, and Death Watch arrived on the planet Mustafar, which was where Moj and the leaders of Black Sun were based. Moj met with the intruders with a battalion of Black Sun foot soldiers, and Maul requested an audience with the leaders of Black Sun. Moj believed that the meeting would end with the deaths of the interlopers, but allowed them to enter. Maul, Savage, and the leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla, entered the chambers of Xomit Grunseit and the other leaders, but they refused to join Maul's Shadow Collective. Due to this, Maul had Savage throw his double-bladed lightsaber across the table, killing every one of the leaders sat there. This move left Moj the highest ranking member of Black Sun, and due to the display he had witnessed he decided to join Maul, which officially brought the Black Sun into the Shadow Collective.\nMaul would then receive the support of the Pyke Syndicate and the Hutt Clan, and with these assets backing him the Sith put his plan into motion. Moj was present for a briefing given by Maul, which outlined their plan. Moj, his Black Sun foot soldiers, Savage, and the Pykes would attack the Mandalorian capital of Sundari, and this would be used to make the current ruler of Mandalore, Duchess Satine Kryze, look weak. Satine's pacifist government would fail to hold back the attack, but then Death Watch would arrive and \"stop\" the criminals. This move would put Pre Vizsla into power, and remove Satine, allowing Death Watch to rule the planet, the long standing goal of that organization. With this Maul planned to expand in the shadows with support from Vizsla.\nMoj and the rest of the attackers arrived on Mandalore, and caused their disruptions across the city from the docks all the way to locations like Peace Park. Moj's team was \"stopped\" by Bo-Katan Kryze and her group of Mandalorian soldiers. The other groups were ultimately \"stopped\" by Death Watch also well in accordance to the plan, and Moj and several others were shown as \"prisoners\" to the public.\nUltimately Vizsla betrayed Maul to try to focus solely on Mandalore, but due to this Vizsla was killed by Maul. This move put Maul in charge of Death Watch, and with this they transitioned to be the Mandalorian super commandos. Maul's plan was ultimately put on hold however, due to his old master: Darth Sidious. Sidious killed Savage, and captured Maul. This meant that Moj and Maul's other allies would have to wait for the Sith's rescue until moving forward.\nLater in 19 BBY, Ziton contacted Marg Krim, the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, and offered to merge their two crime syndicates. Wanting to protect his business and unwilling to lose face with his syndicate, Krim rejected the offer. Zim responded by kidnapping Krim's wife Tezzka and their two children Vram and Laalee. He imprisoned them at the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar, a volcanic planet in the Outer Rim Territories. During their captivity, Ziton ordered that Tezzka be forcibly separated from her children and brought to his palace quarters.\nHowever, Krim hired two bounty huntersâ€”the Dathomirian Nightsister Asajj Ventress and the undercover Jedi Master Quinlan Vos to rescue his family. The two Force-sensitive bounty hunters managed to infiltrate the fortress and rescue Vram and Laalee. An unhappy Ziton learned about the rescue twenty minutes later and gave orders to his aide Kurg Utal to execute Tezzka in order to send a \"message\" to her husband. Before they could carry out the execution, Ziton received a visit from Ventress, who posed as a Pyke Syndicate \"envoy.\"\nWhen the \"envoy\" demanded to see Krim's wife and children, Ziton responded that he could show them Tezzka but that the children would have to wait. Ziton then secretly ordered Kurg to bring the wife so that he could execute her in the envoy's presence. After Kurg had left, he confronted Ventress, recognizing her as one of the intruders who had rescued the children. Shortly later, Tezzka entered the room accompanied by Quinlan, a man sporting a \"strange yellow tattoo\" across his face. Recognizing Vos as an intruder, Ziton attempted to reach for his blaster but Ventress shot it out of his hand.\nVos and Ventress quickly overpowered Ziton's Falleen guards. Ziton attempted to fight against Ventress with his combat arts skills but the Force-sensitive woman bested him and also Force choked him. Before leaving, she warned him not to harm the Krim family again and hurled him against his own throne. The hunters and Tezzka then took the opportunity to escape the palace in Ventress' ship Banshee. Ziton ordered his remaining guards to pursue them but the intruders managed to escape with their hostages back to the Pyke stronghold of Oba Diah. In retaliation, Black Sun sent a fleet of starfighters and Interceptor-class frigates to \"teach Krim a lesson.\"\nDespite Maul's previous capture and the Hutts abandoning the Shadow Collective, the Pykes and Black Sun did remain loyal to Maul's Shadow Collective.\nSince his capture on Mandalore, Maul had been held at the prison known as the Spire, where he was tortured by Darth Sidious and Sidious's current apprentice Darth Tyranus, more widely known as Count Dooku. The pair tortured Maul in order to find the location of Mother Talzin, who was secretly behind Maul's return and was seen as a threat by Sidious. The prison was run by Dooku's government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but two of Maul's Mandalorian commandos, Rook Kast and Gar Saxon were ordered by Almec able to break in and rescue Maul. This was done, and Maul was returned to Mandalorians on Zanbar, but they were quickly found by the CIS. General Grievous attacked the location, and many of Maul's Mandalorian troops were killed in the battle. Due to this, Maul and his remaining Mandalorians retreated to Ord Mantell, which was where Black Sun had a base.\nMoj meet with Maul in the city, and Fife of the Pyke Syndicate meet with them as well. Maul told them that they would soon engage the Confederacy military. Maul had Kast brief Moj and Fife on his plan, and after a group of Nightbrothers arrived to reinforce them, the Separatists arrived. The Shadow Collective engaged the Separatist Droid Army in the city, as Maul fought his way onto Grievous's dreadnought, the Invisible Hand. Maul forced Grievous to shut down the droid army, and Dooku was captured by Shadow Collective forces after fighting the Nightbothers.\nZiton then began to get impatient with Maul, as he saw that the collective was being used more for Maul's personal goals. Maul assured him and Fife that their organizations would receive their money, ordering Moj and Fife to return to their sectors. Maul returned to Dathmoir with the captured Dooku, but they were then attacked by Sidious and Grievous, who had been freed previously.\nConcurrently, the Confederacy launched an attack on the Black Sun, and Ziton contacted Maul's ship in an attempt to discuss their plan. As Maul was fighting Sidious and Grievous, Rook Kast was forced to speak with Ziton and Fife, who also contacted Maul's ship due to a Separatist assault on the Pykes. Seeing that Maul was not going to deploy his fleet to aid them and believing that the entire collective had become a liability, Ziton broke the Black Sun's ties with the Shadow Collective. At the same time, Fife broke the Pyke's ties with the collective as well. The two deactivated their holograms, officially disbanding the collective. With this, the only forces left under Maul's control were his Mandalorians.\nHowever, by the time of the Siege of Mandalore the Black Sun and Moj were once more a part of Maul's Shadow Collective, along with the Pykes and Crimson Dawn. At the height of the siege, Maul contacted his Collective via hologram, informing Moj, Marg Krim, and Dryden Vos to take their respective criminal factions into hiding to wait out the disarray that would be brought on by the end of the Clone Wars, which Maul had foreseen in visions.\nZiton Moj sought to expand the Black Sun's crime empire. He was displeased when Marg Krim, the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, rejected what he termed as a \"very lucrative offer\" to combine the Pyke Syndicate with the Black Sun. Moj's desire to gain control of the Pyke Syndicate's spice distribution operations led him to kidnap Krim's family. Ziton was even willing to kill his hostages in order to force Marg to capitulate to his demands. Moj was infuriated and embarrassed when Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos successfully rescued Krim's family. This attack led the Black Sun to launch a retaliatory strike on the Pykes.\nZiton Maj was well versed in several different types of martial arts. He also specialized in mixing styles in a way that made it hard for his enemies to predict his next move. Despite his combat skills, he was no match for the Force powers of Ventress.\nZiton Moj first appeared as a minor antagonist in \"Eminence,\" the fourteenth episode of the fifth season of the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Despite the cancellation of The Clone Wars TV series in March 2014, Ziton's story was expanded in two The Clone Wars Legacy projects: Jeremy Barlow's 2014 comic story Star Wars: Darth Maulâ€”Son of Dathomir and Christie Golden's Dark Disciple novel; which were both based on unproduced Clone Wars episodes. Ziton has a brief point-of-view passage in Christie's Dark Disciple.",
