 "content": "Yathros Condorius the First was a human male beggar who thought he was the king of Bespin and he turned Cloud City from a gas miner's watering hole to a galactic paradise. He thought Landonis Balthazar Calrissian was his evil regent. When Imperial forces wanted to execute him, one of the Bespin Wing Guard, Darbus Mizz, saved his life. He wanted to bring Yathros to a safe place, but the old man convinced Mizz to stay and help liberate Bespin.",
