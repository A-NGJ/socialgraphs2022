 "content": "FN-2802 was a human male who served in the First Order's FN Corps as a stormtrooper in 35 ABY. The trooper identified the Jedi apprentice Rey and her companions as Resistance operatives, and attempted to capture them while stationed on the planet Pasaana during the Festival of the Ancestors. However, FN-2802 was killed by Landonis Balthazar Calrissian, who shot the soldier in the head with an arrow.\nFN-2802 was the designation of a human male who served as a stormtrooper in the First Order's FN Corps during the war against the Resistance. In 35 ABY, FN-2802 was in the Forbidden Valley on the planet Pasaana during the Festival of the Ancestors. After Supreme Leader Kylo Ren had the First Order forces on the planet alerted to the presence of the Jedi Rey and her allies, FN-2802 spotted the group as they attempted to make their way through the crowded festival back to their starship, the Millennium Falcon.\nThe stormtrooper aimed his blaster and ordered the group to stop, which they did. As FN-2802 attempted to report his discovery of the enemy over comms, he was killed by local hermit Landonis Calrissian, who fired a single bolt from his prod pistol straight through the eye of the stormtrooper's helmet. As the surrounding festival goers reacted in shock and horror to FN-2802's death, Calrissian led Rey and her allies away to safety.\nFN-2802 wore First Order stormtrooper armor with the web gear of a Megablaster heavy assault trooper, but only carried a F-11D blaster rifle at the time of his death.\nFN-2802 first appeared in the 2019 Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker where he was played by actor Nigel Godrich, and voiced by David W. Collins.",
