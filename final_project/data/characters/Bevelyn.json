 "content": "Bevelyn, nicknamed \"Bev,\" was a human female who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. At some point, she met and married a human male named Jon Melton. The couple had two children, Reen and Zelly. Sometime later, Bev and Melton became spies for Crimson Dawn within the Empire due to their dislike at where the Empire was headed and eventually came to work aboard the second Death Star during its construction, with Bev as a cargo worker, and Melton as a lieutenant and aide to Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, the Death Star's commander. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Qi'ra activated her agents within the Empire and instructed them to cause chaos for the Empire. Bev and Melton decided to defect from the Empire and inform the Rebel Alliance about the existence of the Death Star in exchange for safe passage and protection. The pair then made plans to leave the station aboard a shuttle with their children to inform the Rebellion.",
