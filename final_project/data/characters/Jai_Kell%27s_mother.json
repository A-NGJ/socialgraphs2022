 "content": "In the years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Jai Kell lived with his mother on Lothal. He later joined the Academy for Young Imperials on the planet, where the leadership recognized he may have been Force-sensitive and gave his name to the Grand Inquisitor. Ezra Bridger and Zare Leonis learned about this information and helped Kell to escape from the Academy. As a result of the dangers posed by his escape, the rebels agreed to help Kell and his mother go into hiding.",
