 "content": "Orsaa was a Rakata of Lehon who was a member of the Elders, a group of Rakata who refused to revert to cannibalism and barbarism like the tribes led by The One. He was the Keeper of History, maintaining the knowledge and history of the Infinite Empire, the empire that had once ruled and enslaved the galaxy under the rule of the Rakata. Besides extensive knowledge and being one of the leading Elders, Orsaa, like almost all Rakata, had no innate ability to sense or use the Force, though his research was directed toward restoring the ability to be Force-sensitive.",
