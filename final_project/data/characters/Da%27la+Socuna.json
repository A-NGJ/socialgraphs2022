 "content": "Da'la Socuna was a Human female who served the Rebel Alliance as a pilot during the Galactic Civil War.\nWithin the Alliance, Socuna attained the rank of commander and served with the Crimson Phoenix Squadron as a pilot trainer. Sometime following 0 BBY she worked in the Mos Espa cantina on the planet Tatooine. While there, she recruited a spacer sent to her by Gendra. She issued the novice pilot a Z-95 Headhunter and gave a mission to patrol a Rebel spy route in the Tatoo system. Though the pilot was ambushed by three TIE pilot cadets, they were all destroyed, and the pilot returned back safely.\nSocuna later gave additional missions, which included hunting down TIE fighters, and escorting a crippled refugee transport in the system. All missions were completed successfully, and Socuna awarded the pilot with a Rebel flightsuit. However, Socuna had one final task for her new pilot, which involved eliminated a TIE fighter Veteran Commander and his three escorts. Upon successful completion of the missions, Socuna transferred the pilot to Major Eker for additional assignments.\nShe also became involved in the defense of Mos Espa when Tusken Raiders, led by the Tusken King, launched an invasion of the city.\nDa'la Socuna is a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. She was added to the game with the 2004 expansion, Jump to Lightspeed.\nIn the game, Rebel players who join the Crimson Phoenix Squadron begin their training with Socuna.",
