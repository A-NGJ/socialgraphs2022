 "content": "Viil Corvii was a male Sullustan who operated out of Providence as a chief mechanic during the Galactic Civil War.\nViil was the leader of the Sullustan community on Providence. Old and respectable, he often wore a long coat from Sullust studded with pockets full of tools.\nHe was a brilliant pilot, leading at least ten wanted smuggling ships, but his age led him to take more interest in the technical aspects of the profession. He then became technician, one of the best of his time in his years on Providence.\nThe Sullustan was less talkative than his fellows, a calm and thinking individual, but he was capable of great authority when needed. He was respected by the majority of the other Providence leaders, and his expertise in the technical field was strongly sought.\nViil Corvii was created by Jean-Michel Ringuet for the ambiguously canon roleplaying aid \"Providence,\" which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 1.",
