 "content": "Cryalira was a female Tarasin who served as the Irstat-Kes of the Hiironi irstat, the largest Tarasin irstat on Cularin.\nCryalira spent most of her life as a hunter. She was surprised when the previous Irstat-Kes, Meirana, died shortly after the previous Mother did, making her Irstat-Kes instead of Dariana. She would have preferred roaming the jungle to her duties leading the irstat.\nShe had difficulty making decisions for the tribe, believing that she had not been trained nor had talent for the role; but she was still growing into her position, and many believe she would made an excellent Irstat-Kes with time. Certain discontent elements of the irstat were conspiring against her in 32 BBY.\nCryalira had the tendency to raise her crest when presiding, leading many to believe she was always angry.\nHer known relatives included her grandson, Fisonna.",
