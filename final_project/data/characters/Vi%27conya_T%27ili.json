 "content": "Vi'conya T'ili was a female Human bounty hunter who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nVi'conya T'ili was native to the planet Tatooine. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, her family was killed by the Tusken Raiders. She remained deeply traumatized by the loss of her family and vowed to rid Tatooine of the Tuskens.\nIn 1 ABY, Vi'conya T'ili resided in the Imperial capital on Tatooine named Bestine. While there, she encountered a spacer. At first, she was suspicious of the spacer, and even accused the individual of allying with the Tuskens. However, her suspicions and threatening remarks subsided when she learned that the spacer was actually interested in eliminating some Tuskens. She then offered the spacer the whereabouts of two locations on Tatooine, including Fort Tusken, and the Tusken Village in the Western Dune Sea.\nVi'conya T'ili was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Vi'conya T'ili was added to the game with the \"Publish 5\" update, released on December 16, 2003. In the game, players may speak to her to obtain the locations of two Tusken Raider hot spots.",
