 "content": "An unidentified Human female with red hair was staying on Coruscant around the time of the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. She was present in Coruscant City Tours' terminal when the Queen of Naboo Padm√© Amidala came to plead her people's case before the Galactic Senate. That day, she was wearing a grey dress with red sleeves.\nCaptain Quarsh Panaka, Chief of the Naboo Security Force, tried to sell his electrobinoculars to the red-head woman so he could buy two tickets for the city tour. The woman, however, declined Panaka's offer, stating that she had no use for such a device.\nThat red-headed woman only appeared in the 1999 video game Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game. As an in-game Easter egg, the game's development team made several NPCs to look like real-world celebrities. This particular merchant was given the appearance of the famous actress Gilian Anderson.",
