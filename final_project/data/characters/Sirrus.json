 "content": "Sirrus was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He was also the master of Padawan Aubrie Wyn.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Sirrus was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Selecting the Initiate Aubrie Wyn as his Padawan, he nurtured her gift for Force healing until she was marked for special training with Master Mace Windu.\nHowever, before Sirrus could see Wyn through to her full potential, both were forced to take active roles in the Clone Wars. Taking up the mantle of General in the Grand Army of the Republic, Master Sirrus and his Padawan were dispatched to Jabiim to fight in the campaign there. Under the command of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Sirrus joined Kenobi in battle, dying when Separatist forces destroyed one of the Republic's walkers.\nSirrus also kept a holocron on his person, for reasons unknown. He gave this holocron to his Padawan during the Battle of Jabiim, who then gave it to Anakin Skywalker, so he could return it to Coruscant.",
