 "content": "Trill was a female Human colonel of the Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY, Trill was part of Operations Group Five, sent to Belsavis on a mission to start a mass riot. When Captain Oklart and Colonel Trill were approached by the Emperor's Wrath who demanded the whereabouts of Sith Lord Melicoste, Trill attempted to withhold that information; however, Oklart felt it was necessary to assist the Sith in any way possible and revealed Melicoste's destination. Trill felt that would be equal to condemning fellow soldiers to death and accused Oklart of treason. As a result, the Emperor's Wrath killed her to stop her from calling Darth Baras.",
