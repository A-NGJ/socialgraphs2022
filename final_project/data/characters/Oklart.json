 "content": "Oklart was a male Human captain of the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY, Oklart was part of Operations Group Five, sent to Belsavis on a mission to start a mass riot. When Captain Oklart and Colonel Trill were approached by the Emperor's Wrath who demanded the whereabouts of Sith Lord Melicoste, Trill attempted to withhold that information; however, Oklart felt it was necessary to assist the Sith in any way possible and revealed Melicoste's destination. However, Oklart was attempting to manipulate the Wrath into murdering Trill for disobedience to escape an approaching court-martial.",
