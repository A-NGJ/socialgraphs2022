 "content": "B'dasssa, an Akwin scout, was one of many such scouts who kept track of the Humans on Lazerian IV. The information the scout gathered on the Humans in Lazeria City helped the aquatic Akwin—considered mere legends by the Human inhabitants—to completely understand their neighbors.\nIn one incident shortly after the Battle of Endor, B'dasssa overheard a group of Lazerian soldiers discussing the recent death of Emperor Palpatine. When the scout was spotted, the soldiers fired at B'dasssa, who escaped into the ocean. Sneaking back to hear the rest of the conversation, B'dasssa was surprised to hear that the Humans thought the Akwin was just a \"big creature,\" or possibly even a hallucination. It was incidents like this that convinced B'dasssa that the Humans were not ready to be contacted by the Akwin.",
