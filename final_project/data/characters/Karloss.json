 "content": "Karloss was a male Human sergeant in the Imperial Military who was deployed at the Battle of Corellia. He, along with most Imperial forces, was withdrawn from Corellia after the Imperial defeat and was temporarily stationed at Vaiken Spacedock while awaiting redeployment. Karloss was aboard the station shortly after the Korriban Incursion, when he angered the Kaleesh he was drinking with in the cantina, causing the alien to storm off.",
