 "content": "Aquella Firth was a Human female and when she was sixteen, she met Niklas Cories at a Distraction concert and dated him. She eventually dismissed him, as she considered him to be too young and too dangerous. He was determined for revenge, so arranged for her to win tickets for a Distraction concert aboard the Sleemo Poya Jeedai, which was to be held while it was in her home system. Her father, Quoltus Firth forbade her from going, but she ran away and traveled there, anyway. She made it to the concert and was in the front row, while the band performed. Her father had secretly hired a band of mercenaries though, and she was well protected from any harm.",
