 "content": "Wac Bur was a male Rodian who worked as a counterfeiter and forger. In 24 ABY, he sold fake art to Gebbu the Hutt who, in retaliation, sent the bounty hunter Boba Fett after him. Fett tracked Bur down on the Core world of Coruscant. After leading Fett in a mad chase through a network of alleyways, Bur hid in a pile of crates and fruitlessly attempted to plead for his life. He was killed by Fett when he refused to surrender.\nUnusually overweight for a Rodian, Wac Bur was a cowardly individual. He was also highly hypocritical, attempting to lecture Fett on morality when he himself was nothing more than a criminal.\nWac Bur first appeared in Karen Traviss' 2006 eBook Boba Fett: A Practical Man.",
