 "content": "Toryl, also known as Truthful Toryl, was a male Duros starship merchant. He owned and operated Truthful Toryl's Used Spaceship Lot on the planet Tralus, in the Corellian system. \"Used\" was actually a euphemism for \"stolen,\" and Toryl was well known among criminal elements as the sentient to see in order to buy or sell a ship without being noticed by the authorities.\nIn 10 BBY, Han Solo sold the yacht Talisman to Toryl. However, the Hutts were searching for the yacht, and Toryl had to scrap it to avoid unwanted attention.\nFive years later, Han returned to Toryl looking for work with Chewbacca. Toryl provided him with a smuggling job to Duro smuggling components used to place weapons on starships.\n\"Toryl\" was misspelled \"Toryn\" in The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Duros.",
