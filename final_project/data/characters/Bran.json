 "content": "Bran was a human intern for De'Rruyet Industries during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Bran was present at the De'Rruyet Center on the planet Midarr before Beol De'Rruyet, the company's leader, intended to unveil his replication of a Nihil Path engine hyperdrive. Prior to the event, Bran and a fellow intern were sent to collect caf for De'Rruyet. As the two made their way to give De'Rruyet his caf, they were spotted by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros, who were on a job for Lady Domina Tagge to steal the hyperdrive for the Tagge Corporation and needed a way into the center. Aphra grabbed hold of Bran and dragged them into an alleyway, though Bran made a noise which the other intern heard and asked out for Bran. Bran's fellow intern was then grabbed by Starros and brought to the same alleyway, where Aphra and Starros stole the two interns uniform and delivered De'Rruyet's caf to him.",
