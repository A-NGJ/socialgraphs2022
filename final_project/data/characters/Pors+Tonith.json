 "content": "Pors Tonith was a Muun male who served as a financier before joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a naval officer, and maintained strong ties to the InterGalactic Banking Clan. During the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic, Tonith went on to serve as an admiral in the Confederacy navy.\nDespite his arrogance, the Muun's confidence was well-founded through his track record of victories. Tonith also possessed a strong predilection for dianogan tea, which stained his teeth a garish purple.\nPors Tonith was first mentioned in the current Star Wars canon in Rise of the Separatists, a 2019 supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' series of Star Wars Roleplaying products. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Pors Tonith was introduced in Jedi Trial, a 2004 novel authored by David Sherman and Dan Cragg.",
