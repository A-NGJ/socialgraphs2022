 "content": "A Duros officer was a Republic Peace Officer with the Judicial Department Republic Guard. In 30 BBY, while on patrol with his squad, the officer was ambushed by the outlaw Aurra Sing. His fellow police officers were killed and the officer was taken and tied by Sing to a building. When a group of Jedi including Jedi Master Peerce and Knight J'Mikel found the officer, they attempted to free him. However, the captured officer was a trap for the Jedi and Sing killed them.\nThe officer first appeared in Star Wars  28 which was written by Tim Truman and published by Dark Horse Comics on March 28, 2001.",
