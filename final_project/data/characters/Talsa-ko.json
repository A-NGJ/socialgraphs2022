 "content": "Talsa-ko was a female Voss Mystic who lived during the Galactic War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. She sided with the rebellious Sith Lord Darth Serevin during the Battle of Ilum. When confronted by Imperial/Republic heroes, Talsa-Ko stated that she had foreseen that she would side with the victor, so Serevin dueled his enemies to prove the New Empire worthy of allying with the Voss, only to be killed instead. Left at the strike team's mercy, Talsa-Ko pleaded for both herself and Malgus' remaining ground forces to be spared in exchange for joining their side.\nTalsa-Ko is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game. She appears during the \"Battle of Ilum\" flashpoint.\nWhen players defeat Darth Serevin, they can choose to either execute Talsa-Ko for dark side points or spare her for light side points.",
