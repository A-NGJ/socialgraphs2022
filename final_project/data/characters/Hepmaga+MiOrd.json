 "content": "Hepmaga MiOrd was a male of a sentient species who lived on Gamorr. He belonged to a rogue offshoot of a Remplish clan whose ancestors had been cast off Sullust many years prior during a holy war. Like many of his relatives, MiOrd eked out an existence on Gamorr, where he ran a hunting business in the outer wastelands. MiOrd had three sisters with which he co-owned the endeavor. He would track game in the wastelands, and his clientele included wealthy restaurateurs, miners, and Hutts. To aid him in his task, he utilized a form of spear.\nIn Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 , the \"Design An Alien\" competition was launched, in which Star Wars fans were asked to create new aliens inspired by what they had seen in the original trilogy of Star Wars films. 27-year-old Jess Lackaff, one of the entrants, created Hepmaga MiOrd for the competition, and although the entry did not win per se, it was nevertheless published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 , alongside the winners, under the \"honorable mentions\" section of the \"16 and up\" subdivision. Continuity editor Leland Chee later stated that the successfully published \"Design an Alien\" material was in fact canon.. In spite of this, Hepmaga MiOrd has yet to be referenced in any other Star Wars works.",
