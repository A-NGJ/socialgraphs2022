 "content": "Bersin Sekolah was an Ithorian who served as a scout in for the Republic's Scout Service. Sekolah left the Service after the rise of the Empire, convinced that the Scout Service would become a tool of military oppression and expansion. Sekolah chose to retire to the planet Tasariq, a world he once visited during the Clone Wars.\nSekolah turned his attention to finding ways to restore life to Tasariq, and spent over twenty years studying the ecology of the planet. Much of his work involved trying to create plant life that could convert the poisonous gases in the atmosphere to produce oxygen.\nDuring his stay on Tasariq, Sekolah was rewarded with a topaz crystal, granting him the power of Life Detection, and a turquoise crystal which gave him the ability of natural navigation.",
