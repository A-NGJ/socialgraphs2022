 "content": "A human male was the owner of a saloon in the spaceport city Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine. He had trouble with thieves threatening and stealing from him, but was saved by 9 BBY when the fugitive Jedi Nari intervened. The proprietor offered Nari a place to hide in his saloon, but rapidly spreading stories led the Jedi hunting Inquisitorius to the saloon. The Grand Inquisitor, the Inquisitorius leader, questioned the saloon owner and accused him of hiding a Jedi. Another Inquisitor, the Third Sister, then threw a knife at the proprietor, prompting Nari to reveal himself by saving the owner. The Jedi was able to escape the saloon, but was soon intercepted and killed by the Inquisitors.\nThe human male owned a saloon in the spaceport city of Mos Eisley on the desert planet Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Empire. He had trouble with locals stealing from his business, threatening and injuring the proprietor in the process. However, by 9 BBY, ten years after the purge of the Jedi Order, the Jedi Nari came across the saloon and learned of the owner's troubles with thieves. Standing by his Jedi Code, Nari rescued the saloon from the thieves, leaving lightsaber marks on the establishment's walls, and so the proprietor offered to let the Jedi, whose kind were fugitives of the Empire, hide in his saloon.\nUnfortunately for Nari, his heroic actions drew attention, and stories of him saving the saloon spread quickly, reaching the Inquisitorius, a group of Force-sensitive Jedi hunters who worked for the Empire. The Grand Inquisitor, leader of the Inquisitorius, arrived at Mos Eisley with two other Inquisitors, the Third Sister and Fifth Brother. The trio walked over to the saloon, where the proprietor was working and Nari was seated. Noticing his new visitors, the saloon owner approached the Grand Inquisitor, who confirmed with the man that he knew who the Inquisitors were and what they did.\nThe Grand Inquisitor began talking about the key to hunting Jedi and the widespread of rumors about Jedi that the Inquisitorius dealt with. The Inquisitor then brough up the stories of Nari coming across and saving the saloon from thieves. At the end of it, the Grand Inquisitor accuses the proprietor of hiding Nari and giving him fresh water. As the Inquisitor did so, the Third Sister impulsively chose to throw a knife at the saloon owner, leading Nari to reveal himself by stopping the blade with the Force before it could kill the proprietor. As the Jedi then made his escape, the Inquisitors tried to intercept him, but failed to fully capture the fugitive when the Grand Inquisitor had to stop the Third Sister from killing Nari. Although Nari was able to get away at first, he was later intercepted and killed by the Inquisitors.\nThe saloon owner first appeared in the first episode, \"Part I,\" of the Disney+ live action television series Obi Wan Kenobi, directed by Deborah Chow and released on May 26, 2022. Credited as \"Saloon Owner,\" the character was played by Derek Basco. Scenes with the proprietor were first shown in the teaser trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi, published on YouTube on March 9 of 2022.",
