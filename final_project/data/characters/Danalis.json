 "content": "Danalis was a homeless Human girl who was picked up by Garris Shrike.\nDanalis was one of many street children Shrike used to beg and steal for him as he traveled from world to world in the Trader's Luck on smuggling runs. Her face had been gnawed by vrelts, leaving her with no ears or nose and pitiable. Shrike exploited her disfigurement by using her as a beggar. He originally lured Danalis into his service by promising that he would have her face repaired when she earned enough. She trained with the droid F8GN. By the time she was fourteen years old, Danalis realized Shrike would never live up to this promise and committed suicide by cycling an airlock.",
