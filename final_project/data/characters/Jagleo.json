 "content": "Jagleo was a human female who worked as a dancer before becoming a member of the White Worms gang on the planet Corellia. She worked as a thief for the gang and fought using a self-invented style of martial arts that made use of her balance and coordination. In 13 BBY, she was present when the scrumrat Han escaped from Proxima in the Den of the White Worms.\nJagleo was human female from the planet Corellia who worked as a dancer before becoming a scrumrat and a thief in the White Worms gang of Coronet City. In the year 13 BBY, Jagleo was present in the den when fellow scrumrat Han was brought before Lady Proxima, leader of the gang. Han, who had returned from a trade with no goods for Proxima, used a rock to break a shutter behind the gang leader and bathe her in light, which burned her skin. Using the distraction, Han then pushed through the other scrumrats and escaped.\nJagleo adapted her balance and coordination into a self-invented form of martial arts which she used to defend herself. She was a nimble thief and could shimmy into tight spaces. She had fair skin, blonde hair, and green eyes.\nJagleo wore a gray brine-stained tunic, wristwraps, and cap with a gray light-filter headband. She used a pipe as a makeshift weapon.\nJagleo first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. The character was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
