 "content": "Granit was the leader of cave dwellers who was tall and muscular with a glistening black beard, who Stuart Zissu, C-3PO, R2-D2 and 4B-X encountered on Da'nor. He spoke N'or and carried a spear with him. Granit beat Zissu in space poker and won their azurite and their lives. He kept a force pike in the corner of his house.\nGranit was a Rebel operative waiting for Zissu, C-3PO, R2-D2 and 4B-X to arrive with orders to bring them to the secret Rebel base on Romm. Meanwhile he was leading the evacuation of Alliance supporters from Delantine.",
