 "content": "\"Jez\" was the nickname of a clone commando who served in Aiwha-3 Squad of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Trained by the Mandalorian Kal Skirata, the unit first saw action in the Battle of Geonosis, in which all members except Jez were killed. Five days afterward, Jez took part in a standoff on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant after a rogue group of elite Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos gained control of the Arca Company Barracks. He survived the Clone Wars and later served as part of the Republic's forces that were reorganized into the Imperial Army.\n\"Jez\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who was born on the planet Kamino. He was a member of Aiwha-3 Squad, a unit of elite clone commandos. Jez and the other squad members were trained by Mandalorian Sergeant Kal Skirata to serve in the Special Operations Brigade of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 22 BBY, Jez and his squad saw action in the opening battle of the Clone Wars on the planet Geonosis. Fighting against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, all members of Aiwha-3 Squad except Jez were killed.\nFive days after the Battle of Geonosis, Jez was redeployed to the Republic capital planet of Coruscant, where he took part in a standoff at the Arca Company Barracks after six rogue Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos—an elite cadre of clone troopers—took control of the complex. However, Skirata, Jez's old training sergeant, was able to neutralize the situation without violence and even had time to share a few words with Jez during the incident.\nIn 19 BBY, the Clone Wars ended, and the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Jez came to serve in the Imperial Army under Commander Roly Melusar and, along with many other clone commandos, took part in a briefing held by Melusar concerning measures against Force-users.\nA clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, Jez stood 1.83 meters tall. He had a sense of humor and joked about his job as a commando even after losing three of his fellow squad members just days before on Geonosis. Jez was also delighted to meet Kal Skirata, his old training sergeant, on Coruscant. He possessed knowledge of the planet Haruun Kal and its inhabitants, being able to tell the difference between the native Korunnai and Balawai groups.\nJez first appeared in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, a 2006 novel written by Karen Traviss.",
