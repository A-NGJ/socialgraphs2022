 "content": "Tomo was an Ithorian boy in Mos Espa during 32 BBY, who was held in servitude by Captain Neg. He was often promised freedom, although Neg had no intention of fulfilling his promise.\nTomo's Force-sensitive mother found help in the form of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who agreed to speak with Neg, requesting a meeting with him in an attempt to gain Tomo's freedom, but was refused entry by the captain's security door system. However, the Jedi Master found another way into Neg's house and killed the captain's thugs before locating Tomo, who was locked inside a cage. A large beast-like creature owned by Neg broke free from its own cage and attacked Jinn, who slew the monster in battle. Jinn subsequently released Tomo from his cage. The two then made their escape, and Tomo was reunited with his mother.\nTomo was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman. The player, in the guise of Jinn, has the option of freeing Tomo and receiving parts for trade from his mother. This article assumes he did so.",
