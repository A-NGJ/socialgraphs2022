 "content": "Kossex was a female Weequay Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nAn uncommon Force-sensitive Weequay female, Kossex was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Having been raised at the Coruscant Jedi Temple since early infancy, Master Kossex was not a worshiper of her peoples' deity, the Quay.\nWhen the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems went to war, Master Kossex dutifully took up ranks in the Grand Army of the Republic, taking the title of General. Early in the fighting known as the Clone Wars Master Kossex was dispatched to Kamino, the hub of the Republic's cloning operations to protect it from an attack by the Confederacy. Under the overall command of Masters Oppo Rancisis and Shaak Ti, Kossex served as part of Red Squadron, a starfighter wing led by Master Tsui Choi. Piloting a Delta-7 interceptor over Tipoca City, Kossex went head-to-head with several droid starfighters during the fighting. Aiding Jedi Anakin Skywalker evade an enemy fighter, Kossex failed to notice another starfighter on her tail. Before she could react the droid fired and destroyed her interceptor and killed Master Kossex instantly. Because of her adherence to the Jedi Code, her people did not mourn her loss, viewing her instead as a heretic.\nKossex is mistakenly identified as male in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which contradicts her gender as established in The New Essential Guide to Alien Species.",
