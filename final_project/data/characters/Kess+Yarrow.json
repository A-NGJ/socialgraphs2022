 "content": "Kess Yarrow was a male Human pilot in the Rebel Alliance. He was the brother of Fern and Rane Yarrow.\nAfter Kess' and Fern's older brother Rane had become a pilot, both dreamed of becoming pilots too. Unlike Rane, they decided to join the military to get pilot training. But they didn't check with one another before joining, and while Kess joined the Rebel Alliance, Fern decided to join the Imperial Navy. When they realized that they suddenly belonged to opposing factions, both were surprised and disappointed. He didn't always get along with Fern, but neither wanted to fight against his own brother in this war.\nFern tried to persuade Kess to join the Empire, but Kess was unsure as he didn't like how the Empire treated its pilots. Fern himself had considered leaving the Empire, but was unsure about the consequences. And so the arguments between the brothers continued.",
