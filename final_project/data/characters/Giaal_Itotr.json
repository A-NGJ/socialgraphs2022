 "content": "Giaal Itotr was a male Zabrak artist and explorer who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, Itotr resided in the city of Mos Espa on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine where he created two works of art, titled Krayt Dragon Skeleton and Lucky Despot Wreckage. Both of these paintings were subsequently featured in the Museum of Tatooine by curator Lilas Dinhint.\nA male Zabrak by the name of Giaal Itotr lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War, a major conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was a self-professed explorer of Tatooine, a desert planet in the Outer Rim Territories. At one point during his travels, Itotr crossed the Dune Sea without drinking a single drop of water, instead making do with Corellian ale. He also single-handedly defeated an entire unit of stormtroopers at sabacc, tricked an underling of Jabba Desilijic Tiure into giving him his money, and attempted to open an art gallery for Tusken Raiders. However, the latter idea was met with poor results.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, around 1 ABY, Itotr could usually be found in front of the hotel in Mos Espa, a city on Tatooine. While there, he created two paintings, one titled Krayt Dragon Skeleton, which depicted a skeleton of a krayt dragon, and another titled Lucky Despot Wreckage, which depicted the Lucky Despot hotel and casino in Mos Eisley. Itotr used painting as a way to memorialize the thing had had seen during his travels, namely sights unique to Tatooine that had made an impression on him.\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial capital of Bestine, curator Lilas Dinhint oversaw the Museum of Tatooine, which served as the planet's only museum. Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Giaal Itotr was one of the artists to be considered, along with Vanvi Hotne, Klepa Laeel, Kahfr Oladi, Boulo Siesi, and Kolka Zteht. In order to have his paintings featured in Bestine, however, Itotr required enough votes to win over his fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty days, allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.\nDuring the course of his artistry career, Itotr was approached by a number of spacers, many of whom voted for him as their artist of choice. Itotr won the art competitions at various times, allowing him the opportunity to display his paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time his paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 credits. This allowed the opportunity for architecturally-inclined furniture makers and traders to mass-produce copies of Itotr's paintings so that they could be purchased, collected, or displayed for personal use.\nGiaal Itotr had fair skin, and brown-colored eyes. He was an avid adventurer who sometimes found himself in a number of perilous situations, like crossing the Dune Sea with nothing but Corellian ale, or facing off with irate Tusken Raiders who failed to admire his attempt at creating an art gallery. He was skilled at sabacc, at least to the point of being able to win against an entire unit of stormtroopers, who he believed were terrible at the game. He was also not beneath plying money away from gullible thugs of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire. Itotr exhibited a friendly demeanor towards passersby, oftentimes regaling them with tales about his escapades on Tatooine.\nDuring his time as an artist in Mos Espa, Itotr wore a tan labour jacket and a pair of tan large pocket pants with yellow stripes. He also wore a pair of brown sturdy boots with vibrant purple heels and toe caps.\nGiaal Itotr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He was added to the game on February 11, 2004 as part of Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown. The update featured a new Bestine Museum event, in which players could vote for a number of NPC artists in order to have one of their paintings put up for display in the museum. Giaal Itotr was one of these artists, and players who chose to vote for him were required to first converse with him in Mos Espa. If Itotr got the most votes, one of his paintings, either Krayt Dragon Skeleton or Lucky Despot Wreckage, would be displayed for about a one month period, and players could purchase schematics of the paintings during a two week period for a fee of 48,000 credits. The winning artist depended on the player's input, however as the competitions were held monthly, this article assumes 100% game completion, and that Giaal Itotr won the right to display both of his paintings on at least several occasions.",
