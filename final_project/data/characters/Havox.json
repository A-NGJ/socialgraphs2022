 "content": "Havox was a male Human who served the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the reconsituted Sith Empire. During the war, he worked on the planet Quesh selling various weapons from a stall in the Republic Operational Headquarters. While at the store, which was exposed to Quesh's toxic atmosphere, he wore a green uniform, a breath mask and also carried a blaster pistol. Havox had fair skin, brown hair and green eyes.\nHavox appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Quesh. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Havox was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
