 "content": "Mallatobuck, also known as Malla, was the wife of Chewbacca, the Wookiee co-pilot of the Corellian smuggler Han Solo. During the Imperial Era, Malla and her family were enslaved by the Galactic Empire. She was separated from her husband Chewbacca and her son Lumpawaroo. Following the Liberation of Kashyyyk, she was reunited with her family.\nMalla was the wife of Chewbacca and the mother of Lumpawaroo. During the Imperial Era, Malla and her family were enslaved by the Empire. She and her son were put in an Imperial slave camp on Kashyyyk. At some point, Malla was separated from her son Lumpawaroo, who became a child slave in Commandant Dessard's camp on the slopes of Mount Arayakyak. Her husband Chewbacca ended up as a slave on the planet Mimban until he was rescued by Han Solo, a renegade Imperial Mud trooper.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War that pitted the Galactic Empire against the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Chewbacca was traveling with Solo, away from Malla and the rest of his family on Kashyyyk. Following the Liberation of Kashyyyk from the Empire's grasp, Chewbacca finally reunited with his wife and son.\nMalla was a female Wookiee who was married to Chewbacca and the mother of Lumpawaroo. According to Solo, she was intelligent and had hair resembling silk.\nMallatobuck was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2015 young readers novel A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, a retelling of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope written by Alexandra Bracken. Malla was created for The Star Wars Holiday Special, a Star Wars Legends TV movie released in 1978.",
