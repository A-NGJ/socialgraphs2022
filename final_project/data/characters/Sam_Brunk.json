 "content": "Sam Brunk was a male Human moisture farmer who lived on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Empire. He was the husband of Dama Whitesun Brunk.\nSam Brunk and his wife Dama lived in the town of Anchorhead. Along with moisture farming, the two also operated a hotel. The two occupations kept both busy to the point that they infrequently visited the family of Dama's sister, Beru Lars, who lived twenty kilometers from Anchorhead.\nAround 15 BBY, the couple got a new A-1 Deluxe Floater landspeeder. Some time after, the Brunks visited the Lars homestead. There, Sam gave the recent news of Podracing being outlawed by the Galactic Empire. During the visit, Sam was surprised to find that Beru's husband, Owen Lars, had removed his relatives' headstones from their graves at the homestead.",
