 "content": "Waxx was a Human male journalist and holorecorder who operated on Ord Mantell during the Cold War. While doing a piece on Tatooine, Waxx spent three months living with the Jawas, thinking they were his \"spiritual kin\". During the Separatist War, Waxx worked alongside Lamalla Rann until he was persuaded to join the Mantellian Separatist Movement and took holodiscs which contained footage of graphic images of the carnage inflicted by a Separatist attack. Rann predicted that Waxx would eventually realize how immoral the separatists were and return to his job.\nWaxx is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.",
