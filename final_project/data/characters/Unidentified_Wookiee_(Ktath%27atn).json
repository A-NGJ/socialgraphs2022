After learning that a symbiote had been implanted into the Wookiee Krrsantan, the Queen of Ktath'atn mentioned this Wookiee and noted that unlike the last time a symbiote was inside a Wookiee, they were feeding off the lifeforce of a Jedi, before she ordered Han Solo, who had also been infected by a symbiote, to bring Krrsantan to her in as many pieces as he could manage.",
