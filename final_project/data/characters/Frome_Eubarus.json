 "content": "Frome Eubarus was a male Twi'lek, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nEubarus worked for Mothven Star Trading, where he was a junior member of staff who dealt with personnel. In about 31 BBY, he took time off work to go on a two week holiday on the planet Genarius. Before he left, he said that he planned spend his time there gambling and enjoying female company. However, while he was away, his identity was assumed by Jarett Hurgen, who used it to trick the heroes of Cularin into delivering some dangerous cargo.",
