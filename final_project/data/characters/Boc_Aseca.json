 "content": "Boc Aseca , nicknamed Boc the Crude, was a male Twi'lek who was one of the Seven Dark Jedi that Kyle Katarn faced and defeated in his quest to protect the Valley of the Jedi. Once dreaming to become a Jedi, that hope was taken from the Twi'lek when he was deemed too old by the Order. Years later, Boc joined the Galactic Empire and became Inquisitor Jerec's maddest and most sadistic disciple.\nBoc was born on Ryloth in 32 BBY, and as a boy dreamed of being a Jedi hero. Unfortunately, the planet's Jedi Watchman Anoon Bondara was killed the year Boc was born and his discovery as a Force-sensitive did not happen until many years later, when he was told by Nejaa Halcyon that he was too old to be trained as a Jedi. His dreams crushed, Boc felt as though he was cheated out of his destiny.\nBoc poured his energies into learning everything he could about the heroic Twi'leks that came before him. The story that intrigued him the most was that of Newar Forrth, who fought in the many battles that took place on Ruusan at the end of the New Sith Wars. After being killed in battle, the ashes of his funeral pyre crystallized and formed three idols that bore his likeness. Boc was gifted with a psychometric Force power, which allowed him to read \"memories\" from inanimate objects through physical contact, the same power that was also possessed by the Jedi, Quinlan Vos. Boc used the Force to read the impressions from these idols and was able to access shards of Newar's memory. He was mesmerized by the images he saw of Jedi victories at the Battle of Malrev IV and Seventh Battle of Ruusan. This only helped fuel his passion to become a Jedi Knight.\nThe rise of the Galactic Empire and the events of the Great Jedi Purge once again crushed Boc's dreams of becoming a Jedi. To make matters worse, the Empire also encouraged the Twi'lek slave trade. Boc found himself as the manservant of the harsh and bigoted Vice Admiral Terrinald Screed. Inquisitor Jerec noticed the Force-sensitivity in Screed's new servant and demanded that he be turned over to the Inquisitorius, to be executed; Screed complied and handed the Twi'lek over.\nJerec had other plans for him though, sensing that Boc had information regarding the legendary Valley of the Jedi, for which Jerec was searching. Jerec used the Force to rip the information that Boc had gathered from his mind. He made Boc his slave and rewarded him with a cruel quasi-apprenticeship that fueled Boc's hatred toward Humans. In the end, however, Boc became a Jedi—a Dark Jedi.\nBoc was one of the six Dark Jedi, along with Yun, Sariss, Maw, Gorc, and Picaroon C. Boodle, that accompanied Jerec on his quest to find the Valley of the Jedi. He was present at the murders of both Qu Rahn and Morgan Katarn.\nDuring the Mission to Dorlo he was in the assault shuttle that boarded Duno Dree's transport, disabled over the planet. He ordered the Rebels to surrender, and after the ultimatum, he motioned his force of commandos to drill a hole in the hatch and shove a nozzle of sleeping gas; soon they strapped Qu Rahn and his companions to stretchers and brought them to the shuttle, which brought them to the Vengeance.\nWhen Jerec introduced his apprentices to Rahn, Boc reminded to Jerec that he had promised the Jedi's heart; Rahn taunted him saying that he can't win his heart, enraging the Crude Twi'lek, who started threating with cutting out his tongue; Jerec silenced him, pointing out that the Jedi was trying to distract Boc's anger, whereas he should focus it instead. During the interrogation Jerec executed two of the Rebels, as Rahn refused to reveal what he knew about the Valley of the Jedi; then came the turn of Duno Dree, a young pilot who was crying and shaking in fear, yet as he bravely turned to Jerec, once more, defying him, Boc accepted the role of executioner, and in a fast move, he snapped the neck of the young Human. When finally Rahn remained alone, totally defeated, he stole Yun's lightsaber and attacked Jerec's peers. Boc awkwardly performed some spins and then gracefully attacked Rahn's head and missed; in a movement Rahn severed one of the Twi'lek's tendons, who fell down, but Yun pulled him away. He was later taken to the sick bay.\nUpon meeting Morgan's son Kyle Katarn, Boc destroyed the lightsaber Master Rahn had given to Kyle and laughed with maddening glee. But soon afterward Kyle, using Yun's lightsaber, dueled Boc on his way to stop Jerec from harnessing the power of the Valley. Kyle's partner, friend, and love interest, Jan Ors, distracted Boc during the duel by throwing a rock at him. Boc's attention was momentarily directed to Jan, and Katarn killed him at the foot of a statue honoring Newar Forrth in the Valley of the Jedi on Ruusan.\nAs Boc matured in the dark side of the Force, his hatred became overshadowed by a highly developed madness. He would speak with distinct pauses, often laughing between words, and he managed to remain a joker even in the most serious situations. Despite this, Boc's speech was eerily precise, he was quite capable of maintaining rational conversation, and he never allowed his deranged manner to distract from his focus on a situation.\nIt is unknown how much of Boc's personality was actually insanity that had consumed him, and how much was a creative ploy. Many who encountered Boc perceived his wild emotions as a testament to his weakness. Sariss, one of Jerec's other Dark Jedi, would shout orders at the Twi'lek with spite and impatience. In the brief moments when darkness clouded Kyle Katarn's thoughts, he regarded Boc as a mere \"nuisance,\" and even the late Jedi Master Qu Rahn was inclined to dismiss the Dark Jedi as a crude one who lacked \"tact and teeth\"—in a word: ineffective.\nSomeone who enjoyed tormenting living creatures, Boc was in cheerful mood whenever he was on the field, leading a mission, thinking of the suffering he would cause. The fact that he often found himself leading a task force of  humans, with absolute authority over their lives, without thinking of anyone's opinion, gave him pleasure. His eagerness brought him leading his forces from the front, unlike what most of his peers would do, something appreciated by the men under him.\nJerec certainly saw enough power in the Twi'lek to have him by his side often, and the crazed Dark Jedi was the last challenge to stand between Katarn and Jerec himself. Regardless, madness was Boc's final passion: when he realized that Katarn had struck the death blow against him, he laughed maniacally with his last few breaths before finally collapsing.\nBoc's lightsaber skills and Force mastery grew in proportion to his growing anger and madness. As a practitioner of Form VI, his fighting style was described as unorthodox and unpredictable. One of his combat strategies included jumping about incessantly, making it as difficult as possible for his opponent to make a physical strike against him, all the while laughing and taunting his foe. Boc also often tricked opponents into believing he wielded a single wide lightsaber, but it was in reality two lightsabers—in the midst of battle, the Twi'lek would separate the modified weapon and launch into an awkward, seemingly clumsy, but deadly imitation of his idol's two-bladed Jar'Kai style.\nOther than Jerec, Boc is the only known individual to have been adept in the use of Force Destruction, a rage-powered manifestation of the Force. He could also draw on the ability to telekinetically throw debris at his enemies. Further, he had at least a limited ability to conceal his presence, both physically and from other Force sensitives, as Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors learned when one of the supposed statues in the Valley of the Jedi suddenly leaped from its pedestal to confront them.\nThe name Boc Aseca is an anagram of the Spanish words \"Boca Seca\", which literally translates to \"Dry Mouth\".\nWhile realized by a computer-generated imagery character in the game itself, Boc is portrayed by actor Time Winters in cutscenes after completion of certain levels.\nThere are two disparate accounts as to how Boc officially died. According to the illustrated novella Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, Katarn used the dark side of the Force to forge an invisible spear of midnight black, which he hurled at Boc, killing him almost instantly. In The Dark Forces Saga, Katarn put an end to Boc's Jedi dreams by cutting the Twi'lek down with his lightsaber at the foot of the statue.",
