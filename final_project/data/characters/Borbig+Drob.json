 "content": "Borbig Drob was a male Houk who worked as a gladiator during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign and was declared champion of the contest known as the Stormblade Bloodfest on nine occasions. He was invited to take part in the event known as Gladiator Night on the planet Lothal, where he faced the Feeorin gladiator Warjak, whom he had agreed to lose to for additional pay. The rigged match was interrupted, however, by the arrival of Imperial Security Bureau Lieutenant Jenkes, who was being chased by the bounty hunter Bossk and his companion Ezra Bridger. After Jenkes wounded him, Bossk requested that he fight the two gladiators in bare-handed combat, which Drob and Warjak agreed to, only for the bounty hunter to defeat them both.\nThe male Houk Borbig Drob worked as a gladiator during the early years of the Galactic Empire's rule. He participated in the gladiatorial event known as the Stormblade Bloodfest several times, emerging victorious on nine occasions. Sometime after his ninth victory, Drob was hired by the Imperial Security Bureau Lieutenant Jenkes, who used the alias \"the Commissioner\", to take part in an event called Gladiator Night on the planet Lothal. Drob, and his opponent Warjak, were picked up on the planet Nyriaan by a transport, which delivered them to the Capital City spaceport on Lothal in secret, as Jenkes was operating the gladiatorial fights illegally. Once on Lothal, the pair were taken in an unmarked Imperial Troop Transport to Monad Outpost, a mining outpost refurbished for the fight.\nAt Monad Outpost, Drob was armed, before heading into the arena where he was introduced to the waiting crowd by Gladiator Night's Pa'lowick announcer, garnering both cheers and boos from the audience of gamblers watching. Before the fight began, Warjak confirmed with Drob that the Houk would let him win, as the Commissioner had promised them a small fortune if they rigged the fight. The fight then began, but was soon interrupted by the arrival of Jenkes in the arena, who was being chased by the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk and a local street urchin named Ezra Bridger. Drob and Warjak failed to notice the trio's arrival at first, but realized something was wrong when the cheering of the crowd ceased, causing them to stop fighting.\nJenkes, who Drob did not know was the Commissioner, wounded Bossk and then announced that he was only there to kill Bossk and not to stop the fight, after which Bossk announced that if he were to die, it should be in combat against the gladiators. This earned the approval of the crowd, and Drob and Warjak prepared to face the Trandoshan, who asked that the fight be in unarmed combat. The two gladiators obliged and dropped their weapons, after which Bossk immediately launched himself at Drob, headbutting him in the face and driving his knee into the Houk's stomach, causing him to collapse. Bossk then also defeated Warjak, before revealing that Jenkes was the Commissioner and that he had planned to steal the bets of every gambler at the arena. Imperial forces then arrived at Monad Outpost, and Jenkes was arrested.\nBorbig Drob was a capable gladiator who won the Stormblade Bloodfest on multiple occasions. However, he was willing to lose in a rigged match against Warjak for additional pay. When Bossk challenged him and Warjak to bare-handed combat, Drob assumed he could easily defeat the wounded Trandoshan and willingly dropped his weapons, only to be quickly beaten by the bounty hunter. The Houk was heavily muscled, with huge forearms.\nAt Monad Outpost, Drob fought bare-chested with a heavy sword and a broad shield.\nBorbig Drob first appeared in Ezra's Gamble, a junior novel written by Ryder Windham and released in 2014.",
