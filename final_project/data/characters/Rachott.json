 "content": "Rachott was a female Ugnaught xenobiologist who served the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars on Drongar.\nIn 20 BBY, she was stationed in the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 12. She was in charge of the analysis of the Bota harvest and discovered that the plant was losing its medical application. The boss of the xenobotanists should have made public these results, but the Black Sun agent Kaird bribed him and the information remained as a secret. Rachott was in love with a Ugnaught stationed on the RMSU-7, Rorand Zuzz, and told him this important event. Then, Rorand shared this information with the journalist Den Dhur.",
