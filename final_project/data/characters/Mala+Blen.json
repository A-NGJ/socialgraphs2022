 "content": "Mala Blen was a female Twi'lek and the older sister of Aola Blen. Together, the Twi'leks ruled Thaere Privo in a complex interplay of power politics. The sisters had some contact with the Hutt crime lord Riboga from the neighboring Cularin system. In public, Mala often expressed disdain for the Hutt and his organization, but is was rumored that in private, Mala made extended visits to the Hutt's court, bringing a range of delicacies to hand feed to the crime lord.\nShortly after Riboga's departure from the Cularin system, both the Blen sisters died, and the control of Thaere Privo shifted to the Bothan Bal Ferensil.",
