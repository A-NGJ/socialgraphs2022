 "content": "Firstpilot Rekush was a Mon Calamari officer and one of Gial Ackbar's closest aides. Rekush was the one who pointed Feylis Ardele out to Wedge Antilles as a possible Rogue Squadron candidate.\nRekush was mentioned once in 1998's Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron, written by Peet Janes for Dark Horse Comics, within a short character biography of Feylis Ardele. When the Handbook was reprinted in the 2005 Omnibus X-Wing Rogue Squadron Volume 1, many of its entries were heavily truncated, and the mention of Rekush was among the material that was cut.",
