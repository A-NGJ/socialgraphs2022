 "content": "Orqiti Aneofo was a merchant who resided in the city of Bestine on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime after 0 BBY, Orqiti worked out of a merchant area in Bestine, alongside her Jawa associate. During the elections in Bestine between Sean Trenwell and Victor Visalis, Orqiti encountered a spacer who she mistook as an individual interested in collecting influx capacitors. After listening to the Jawa for clarification, she learned that the spacer was not the one she was waiting for. Nonetheless, she used the chance to encourage the spacer to vote for Sean Trenwell as Bestine's Director of Commerce so that the marketplace in the city could thrive.\nOrqiti Aneofo was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. She often appeared next to a Jawa in the Bestine marketplace, and would encourage players to vote for Sean Trenwell. Though her appearance and gender were consistent in the game, her name was actually randomly generated. However, the randomly generated name, Orqiti Aneofo, appeared in the Star Wars Galaxies Friday Feature named Bestine Politics: Political Intrigue in Bestine. Since the feature is an official source, this suggests that the name Orqiti Aneofo is the most canon version of her name.",
