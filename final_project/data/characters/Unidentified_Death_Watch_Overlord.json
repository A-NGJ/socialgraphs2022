 "content": "A Human male was the Overlord of the Death Watch remnant during the Galactic Civil War. They were based inside the Death Watch bunker on the forest moon of Endor, virtually hidden from the rest of the galaxy.\nThis Death Watch Overlord was in command of Death Watch Wraiths, Ghosts, Bloodguards, and Black Sun mercenaries dispatched within the bunker.\nSometime in 1 ABY he was killed by an individual working for Commander D'krn, who wished to obtain a vial of his blood for possible usage in cloning a new batch of stormtroopers.\nThis Death Watch Overlord was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Though his appearance was always obscured by his armor, using an in-game text command revealed him to be a Human male.",
