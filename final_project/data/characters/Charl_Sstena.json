 "content": "Charl Sstena was a male Jawa smuggler from the planet Tatooine who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAround 0 ABY, Charl Sstena helped sell C-3PO and R2-D2 to Owen Lars. He then apparently survived the onslaught by the Imperial Stormtroopers soon after.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Sstena worked as a smuggler, transporting goods outside the Tatooine system. In 1 ABY, he was contracted to deliver goods to the Meatlumps, a criminal gang on Corellia. A spacer working for a Meatlump armorer contacted Sstena and arranged a rendezvous outside Coronet. However, the meeting point was attacked by some Ragtags, a rival criminal group. After the spacer defeated the attackers, Charl Sstena was able to land and make the delivery.\nCharl Sstena was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Charl Sstena was added to the game as part of the \"Meatlumps Theme Park\", introduced with \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008.\nPlayers who took part in the \"Meatlump Themepark\" could receive a quest where they must speak to Charl. When the player spoke to him, Charl would ramble on about Uncle Owen and R5-D4.",
