 "content": "Mennis Duren was a member of a sentient species and had yellow skin, gray hair, and orange eyes. The alien was present on the Ring of Kafrene trading outpost in the year 0 BBY. The Rebel Alliance agent Cassian Jeron Andor passed by Duren in the outpost's busy streets while the alien stood next to a Delphidian at a food stall. Andor then passed the alien again at the entrance to an alley where the agent was due to meet his contact Tivik.\nDuren was later present in Jedha City on the moon of Jedha, where the alien spoke with a hooded individual near several market stalls shortly before the city's destruction by the Galactic Empire. Duren wore blue robes while on the Ring of Kafrene and Jedha.\nMennis Duren first appeared in the 2016 Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Duren was portrayed by Dilu Miah, who has said the character was difficult to play due to the heavy cloak. The character was not named in the film's theatrical release but was identified in the \"Rogue Connections\" featurette included in the picture's home release. The featurette also revealed that the character was named after Industrial Light \u0026 Magic special effects artist Dennis Muren.",
