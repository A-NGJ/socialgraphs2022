 "content": "Surrel was a female Human who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, in which she served as a corporal in the military forces of the Alderaanian Great House of Organa. During the conflict she worked selling light armor in in the market section of the estate in the Apalis Coast region of the planet Alderaan. She had dark skin, brown eyes, and brown hair. While selling goods from a stall, she carried a blaster pistol, wore armor, and had a piece of silver-colored jewelry on her forehead.\nSurrel appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Light Armor Vendor for Republic players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Surrel was removed from the game along with the rest of the Light Armor Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
