 "content": "An Eodon was living on the Forest Moon of Endor in 3 ABY. At some point, the Eodon its tusks, and they ended up in the possession of a merchant named Mooth who operated a trading post on the moon. The Eodon eventually traveled to Mooth's place, where the toothless creature discovered that the tusks were now in the possession of four young Ewoksâ€”Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, Latara, Teebo, and Wicket Wystri Warrick. The Eodon demanded the tusks back, and the Ewoks complied.\nThis Eodon was created by writer Michael Reeves for \"Hard Sell,\" an episode of the Ewoks animated series that first aired on October 25, 1986, during the show's second season. The unidentified Eodon is played by an uncredited voice actor.",
