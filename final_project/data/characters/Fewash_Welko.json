 "content": "Fewash Welko was a Selkath member of the Order of Shasa. He was one of the Shasan adepts who, shortly before the Battle of Endor, met a dark-suited Human Jedi and was convinced to rise up against the Imperial forces occupying Ahto City. Welko was one of the two hundred Shasans who engaged in the dark side-fueled massacre, and afterward was informed by the \"Jedi\" that they now served the same master.\nHe eventually wrote the book, The Battle of Ahto: A Memoir.",
