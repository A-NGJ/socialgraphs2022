 "content": "Lucius Rothingham was a former engineer working for the Galactic Empire as a spy. His Imperial career also involved kidnapping, interrogation and sometimes killing. He was a born pragmatist and loved serving the Empire, seeing the regime as a means of keeping order in the Galaxy, and his conscience was subordinated by his desire to serve well. A well-educated man with a broad knowledge base, he was adept at technical matters, and had an annoying habit of using mechanical and technical metaphors in his speech. He reported to Captain Anton Kale. After the Empire's fall, Rothingmam would still strive to maintain its ideals, and worked toward its eventual restoration. He had several tattoos on his arms and chest.",
