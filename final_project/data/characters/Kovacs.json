 "content": "Kovacs was a stormtrooper stationed on the Forest moon of Endor prior to 4 ABY.\nHe was part of a platoon of stormtroopers sent to make contact with the native Ewoks. When one of the Ewoks stuck a flower in the barrel of one of the troopers's blasters, the platoon leader misinterpreted it as the Ewoks trying to jam their weapons and ordered the troops to open fire. After this, the Ewoks began attacking the Imperials at night, including Kovacs, whose desecrated remains were found by his squadmates thereafter.",
