 "content": "Borvo was a human male sniper and soldier who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nBorvo was a human male who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a soldier and marksman. By the year 0 BBY, the Alliance was involved in the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. During this time, Borvo may have served the Alliance on various missions based on the planet Jedha and may have also participated in the battle on the planet Scarif.\nBorvo was a light-skinned human with a graying beard and brown eyes.\nWhile participating in missions, Borvo would wear the garb of a rebel trooper. In addition to carrying a blaster rifle, Borvo utilized a sniper rifle that could be used to pick off targets at long range.\nBorvo was created as a playable character for the online browser video game Star Wars: Boots on the Ground, and was one of four characters—alongside Cassian Andor, K-2SO, and Shara—that the player was given to use at the start of the game. Borvo could be selected as a member of the player's three-man rebel squad that would undergo missions together.\nGiven the freedom that the player has in creating their squad, there is no certainty as to what missions and battles in the game, if any, Borvo actually participated in.",
