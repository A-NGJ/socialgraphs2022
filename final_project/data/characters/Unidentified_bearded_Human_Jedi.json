 "content": "This bearded Human Jedi was a Jedi who had survived Order 66. He fell victim to the Great Jedi Purge in the Battle of Shumari in which Imperial forces clashed with a group of Jedi survivors. He witnessed the deaths of three of his fellow Jedi at the hand of Darth Vader and swore that Vader would pay for it, but in the ensuing abrupt duel, Vader easily dispatched him. As he lay dying, the Bearded Jedi encouraged Tao, who was also present during the battle, to stay alive.\nThis individual only appears in the story Perfect Evil, which spanned issues Black and Silver of Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical. The planet Shumari has been later referenced in The Essential Atlas, which included the Shumari system in its appendix. However, according to Jason Fry, \"its inclusion shouldn't be taken as a statement of canonicity for anything except the geography.\"",
