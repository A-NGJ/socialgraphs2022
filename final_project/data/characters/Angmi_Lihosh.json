 "content": "Angmi Lihosh was a female human who lived on the planet Lothal in the year 4 BBY. Alongside Tsoklo and Lornto Teswam, she listened to a Ezra Bridger's broadcast denouncing the Galactic Empire. She later found herself at the mercy of Imperial stormtroopers. However, the Spectres led by Kanan Jarrus managed to rescue her, and she went to live in the rebel hideout known as the Haven, along with other defenseless citizens.\nAfter being brought to the Haven, Lihosh remained frightened but was given hope by a member of the Spectres, whom she thanked.\nAngmi Lihosh wore a conical helmet with a green tunic and trousers.\nAngmi Lihosh first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Call to Action,\" and was first identified in the mobile game Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions. Along with extras from the episodes \"Spark of Rebellion,\" \"The Future of the Force,\" and \"Legacy,\" Lihosh's character model is a recolored version of that of Imperial Minister Maketh Tua.",
