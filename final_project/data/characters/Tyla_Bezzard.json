 "content": "Tyla Bezzard was a Human female who resided on the planet Tatooine during the final years of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire.\nThe daughter of Lotho Pelhane, a farmhand at Orrin Gault's moisture farm, Bezzard grew up on Gault's ranch until her father left to start his own farm. She later married another local moisture farmer, Tellico Bezzard, and the two had an infant son by 19 BBY. As a result of frequent attacks by Tusken Raiders, Gault set up the Settlers' Call, a fund which provided weapons and vehicles for the mutual defense of its members. The Bezzards subscribed to the Settlers' Call, but Pelhane chose not to until an apparent Tusken Raider attack on his home forced him to move out and convalesce with his daughter on the Bezzard farm. Only weeks later, however, the Bezzards were attacked by Tusken Raiders. Pelhane was killed in the attack before the other Settlers' Call members arrived drove the Tuskens off. In the aftermath of the attack, the Bezzards temporarily left the farm and were put up by Annileen Calwell, a merchant at the nearby Pika Oasis. Grieving for her father and afraid to return to the farm, Bezzard remained at Calwell's with her son after her husband returned to the farm.",
