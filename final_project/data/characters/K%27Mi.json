 "content": "K'Mi was a Kushiban male slave. Although not a fighter, he could be aggressive when accused of being cute.\nIn around 20 BBY, K'Mi was imprisoned against his will in Phylus Mon's slave zoo aboard the Animiasma. He was willing to cooperate in a massive escape if needed.\nPhylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves. The explosive would be activated in the case of Phylus Mon's death, but it could also be deactivated with the impact of an ion weapon. All the slaves in Phylus Mon's zoo were also regularly battered.",
