 "content": "Vakk was a male Gand findsman who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Empire.\nVakk joined the crew of a rebellious young smuggler, and carried out various missions on the smuggler's behalf throughout the Anoat sector.\nAt the time of the Iron Blockade, the findsman Vakk operated in the Anoat sector. Unusual even among his mystically minded peers, Vakk was strictly non-violent, using his skills only to track and discover but never to apprehend or kill.Vakk first appeared in Star Wars canon in the multiplayer mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, created by the Kabam company and released on September 10, 2015 for iOS and Android platforms. Within the scope of the game, Vakk acts as a potential crewmate for the player character, able to be tasked with carrying out timed quests to recover valuable experience points and loot.",
