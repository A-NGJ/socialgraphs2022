 "content": "Kobbu was a green-gray male Toydarian with warts and a pathological liar.\nDue to a bet he made with a Hutt, Kobbu was captured and imprisoned by slaver Phylus Mon in his zoo at the ship Animiasma. There, in around 20 BBY, Kobbu would hover in his cell. Whenever he found anyone he could think could help him, he pretended to be a mighty Jedi eager to punish the evil-doers who did that.\nPhylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves. The explosive would be activated in the case of Phylus Mon's death, but it could also be deactivated with the impact of an ion weapon. All the slaves in Phylus Mon's zoo were also regularly battered.",
