 "content": "Lyn Sekla was a female yellow Twi'lek who wanted desperately to get off Taris. In 3956 BBY, she heard that Bib Surool of the Starlight Entertainers was stuck on Taris due to the Sith quarantine, and auditioned for him as a dancer. Revan ensured her that he could be a good partner for her audition, and helped her to be hired.\nIf the player's persuade skill is high enough, then they can persuade her to be her partner. If the player succeeds then she is hired; however, the player can also purposely ruin the audition by running around her in circles or falling down.\nThere are 3 dances, each with 3 choices:\nSafe: Revan is careful, dancing off a bit to the side. This always works, and Lyn is guaranteed a job.\nBold: Revan dances close to Lyn, be it to the side, in front or behind. Success of each dance is 50-50.\nRuin: Revan spoils Lyn's chance, like her last 2 partners.",
