 "content": "\"Drayk\" was the nickname of a clone trooper captain who served in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, he was part of a battle group that was sent to the planet Kothlis to prevent a Confederate invasion—led by General Grievous—from eliminating the Bothan Spynet. Although their communications were jammed due to a new Separatist weapon, the Republic fleet forced Grievous to retreat from Kothlis. Following the battle, Drayk worked with Clone Sergeants Ando and Ven to coordinate the remaining clone trooper forces on Kothlis.\nA clone trooper captain by the nickname of \"Drayk\" was one of many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett who were bred on the planet Kamino to fight in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 21 BBY, the second year of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic dispatched a fleet to the planet Kothlis in order to thwart a Confederate planetary invasion led by General Grievous, who was intent on eliminating the Bothan Spynet. Drayk was subsequently assigned to the battle group bound for Kothlis. When the Republic fleet arrived near Kothlis, Grievous made use of a computer virus that jammed the communication systems of the Republic starships. Although their mission was complicated because of the virus, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker ordered a counterattack. The Republic's clone trooper forces landed on Kothlis' surface and fought against the Confederacy's battle droids, suffering heavy losses due to the unexpectedly large number of droids.\nDuring the battle, the Republic fleet restored their communication systems and forced Grievous to withdraw from the system. Skywalker subsequently led squadrons of Republic starfighters to support the ground troops on Kothlis, and the Republic forces eventually defeated the remaining battle droids. Because Kenobi had been injured during the battle and Skywalker was needed elsewhere, Captain Drayk received orders to conclude the work on Kothlis, since the Confederate attack had left heavy damages. Clone Sergeants Ven and Ando also remained on Kothlis to help coordinate the troops.\nCaptain Drayk was raised and trained on the planet Kamino. Like all clone troopers, he stood 1.83 meters tall. He fought for the Galactic Republic's Grand Army and earned a reputation for being a good and reliable officer. Jedi General Anakin Skywalker possessed a level of trust for Drayk, and had the officer coordinate the remaining troops after the battle on Kothlis.\nDrayk first appeared in the first novel of the Clone Wars Gambit duology, Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth. The novel was published in February 2010 and was written by author Karen Miller. In the novel, Drayk was mentioned in a dialogue between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi following the battle on Kothlis.",
