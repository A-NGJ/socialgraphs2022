 "content": "Many generations before the Galactic Civil War, a king ruled over the Phlogs who lived in the land of Simoom on the Forest Moon of Endor. At some point, his subjects decided to build a palace for him, which prompted them to chop down all the trees of the land to build it. Because of that, Simoom became a desert, and the Ewok tribes who lived there were forced to flee to other side of the Forest Moon.",
