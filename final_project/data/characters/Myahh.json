 "content": "Myahh was a male Twi'lek who served the Galactic Republic during the Cold War. As first lieutenant of the Endar Rebirth, Myahh was part of the ship's mission to investigate devastated ecumenopolis planet Taris as a potential site for the Republic's planned Taris Resettlement Initiative in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War. At some point the ship was destroyed in orbit, and Myahh was among a small group of survivors to escape to the planet surface.\nMyahh and the Republic soldiers lived in the Tarisian wilderness for five years before he came across a Republic encampment overseen by Commander Bhoenn. With the aid of Republic agents, Myahh and the soldiers were rescued and promised Republic support for the rest of their lives.\nAfter five years of isolation in the Rakghoul-infested wilderness of Taris, Myahh had developed a jittery, alarmist personality. He was jumpy and terrified of many things, fearing attack even when none was forthcoming.\nMyahh was first introduced as an NPC character in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. His role was in presenting the player character with the mission \"Operation Salvage,\" in which the player must rescue the surviving members of the Endar Rebirth from the Tularan Marsh region on Taris.",
