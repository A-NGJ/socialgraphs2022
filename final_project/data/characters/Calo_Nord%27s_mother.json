 "content": "The mother of Calo Nord was a Human woman married to Nord's father. The couple sold their son into slavery when he was a young boy. When he turned sixteen years of age, Nord killed his slave masters and proceeded to track down and murder his parents. After Nord killed his parents, a bounty was placed on his head. However, Nord killed the bounty hunters sent after him, and eventually found and killed the people who placed that bounty. He grew to become the most feared bounty hunter of his time.",
