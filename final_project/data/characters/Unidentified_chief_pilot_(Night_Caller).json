 "content": "A male lieutenant was a young Human who served as a chief pilot aboard the modified New Republic CR90 corvette Night Caller.\nDuring the New Republic's campaign against Warlord Zsinj, the chief pilot was assigned to the recently captured Night Caller, a modified CR90 corvette that Wraith Squadron managed to capture from Zsinj's fleet. His assignment was due to the loss of the ship's entire bridge crew—with the exception of Lieutenant Atril Tabanne—during the Battle of Talasea. The chief pilot would later survive the battle between the New Republic and Zsinj's vassal Admiral Apwar Trigit on the planet Ession.",
