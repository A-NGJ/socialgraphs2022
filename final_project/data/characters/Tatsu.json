 "content": "Tatsu was a male Pantoran Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Pantoran, Tatsu was a Padawan apprenticed to the skilled Jedi Master Bruu Jun-Fan during the Clone Wars. Like most Padawans, Tatsu constructed his green-bladed lightsaber lightsaber at a young age. Bruu Jun-Fan, his Master, took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. One notable event that he participated in was the Skirmish on Yellowblade's Landing, where he and Jun-Fan, as well as Plo Koon, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Grohto, and Ko Solok traveled to Yellowblade's Landing to apprehend Darth Maul and his brother, Savage Opress.\nDuring the engagement with Opress, Tatsu called Oppress a coward as Maul and Savage were fleeing from the Jedi strike force with Esano's sister, who had agreed to pay the two Sith for her rescue from the Scourge gang. In return for being called a coward, Savage cut off his right hand. Afterwards, the two Sith escaped along with the female, killing Grohto and several clone troopers in the process. Since Tatsu was injured, he could not continue to the chase of Darth Maul and his brother to Pleem's Nexus.\nDuring the Skirmish on Pleem's Nexus, his Master Bruu Jun-Fan along with Ko Solok, was slain by Maul, and Tatsu was left masterless.",
