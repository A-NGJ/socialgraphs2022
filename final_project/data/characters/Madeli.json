 "content": "Madeli was a human female farmer who lived in a farming settlement near Black Spire Outpost on Batuu. When Dolin, a farmer from the community who had joined the Resistance, attempted to convince his friends to fight against the First Order, Madeli and the other farmers were skeptical. However, after stormtroopers of the First Order killed one of the settlement's residents, Tophin, many of the farmers chose to assist the Resistance.",
