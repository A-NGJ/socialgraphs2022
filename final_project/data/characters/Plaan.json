 "content": "Plaan was a male Weequay. In 25 ABY he was the chief of security on Tholatin. He later was first mate on the Sweet Surprise, and encountered Han and Leia Organa Solo on Nova Station looking for someone to pilot refugees to Coruscant. Plaan indeed went to Coruscant to deliver refugees, but aboard the Sweet Surprise he also carried at least four voxyn. Nevertheless the voxyn were captured by Han and Leia Solo, with help from Rogue Squadron, before they were unleashed on Coruscant.",
