 "content": "A human male impostor of the Rebel Alliance operative Luke Skywalker lived in the galaxy during the Imperial Era. Around 3 ABY, he boasted in a cantina about his alleged exploits of destroying the Death Star, hoping he could fool bar patrons and be hired as a pilot. He said to ask his astromech droid Ardee if they didn't believe him, since she was there with him handling the targeting computer. Soon after, however, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader Force choked the man killing him. Darth Vader spared the other customers of the cantina because he wished them to witness that \"claiming the name of Luke Skywalker also claims his crimes against the Empire\".\nThe impostor had fair skin and blond hair. He wore dark glasses to hide his cybernetic left eye. The man was a swaggering trickster, but when the Sith Lord Darth Vader confronted him, he apologized and tried to excuse himself, but the Sith Lord killed him anyway.\nThe unidentified Luke Skywalker impostor appeared in the comic Star Wars  5, published by Marvel Comics on August 5, 2020. The comic was written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Jes√∫s Saiz, Arif Prianto, and Dan Brown.",
