 "content": "Broadside was the Wookiee bartender at the Starboard Broadside Club, a cantina aboard Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport. He was overweight, and several patches of hair were missing due to scars from injuries sustained during his life as a gladiator. Rumor was he had fought alongside Omze in the gladiator pits of Loovria.\nHe kept peace in his club by using his immense strength and a large metal pipe he kept behind the bar.",
