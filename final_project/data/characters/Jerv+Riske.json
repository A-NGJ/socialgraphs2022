 "content": "Jerv Riske, a Human male, was a former bounty hunter who served as the personal bodyguard of Passel Argente. He teamed up with Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Lorana Jinzler to foil an assassination plot against the Corporate Alliance leader, although it was Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth who was finally responsible for saving Argente's life.\nWhen Corporate Alliance leader Passel Argente traveled to the planet Barlok for a round of negotiations with the mining guild there, Riske, who had quit his job as a bounty hunter, served as his loyal bodyguard.\nInside the eating establishment Panky's, Riske encountered a trio of Jediâ€”Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Lorana Jinzler. They did not recognize him, but Riske knew the caliber of beings he was dealing with and tried to escape when Kenobi and Skywalker were distracted. However, after being pursued by Lorana Jinzler, Master C'baoth's Padawan, he paused to confront the young Jedi. Riske was immediately forthright with her, explaining the reasons for his presence on the planet, but likewise inquired about the objectives of the Jedi Council in sending its representatives there. After Jinzler responded in kind, the two parted ways.\nLater, Kenobi and Skywalker encountered Riske again in their continuing investigations. As the Jedi were searching for the missing Lorana, Riske briefly offered his help by way of information, then returned to his own investigations and preparations for the Corporate Alliance-Barlok mining guild negotiations set for the following day.",
