 "content": "Uopled was a male Rodian black marketeer.\nHaving initially attempted a bounty hunting career, Uopled began working for a black marketeer. He discovered he was naturally talented at this line of work, excelling in negotiations, and soon made a fortune dealing in stolen goods. He then bought Petabys Station very cheaply and transformed it into one of the most successful Invisible Markets during the reign of the Galactic Empire.",
