 "content": "\"Hawk\" was a clone trooper pilot who served in the Galactic Republic Starfighter Corps during the Clone Wars. Bred from a human template, the bounty hunter Jango Fett, he often performed escort, drop-off, or extraction duties for Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's 501st Legion.\n\"Hawk\" was a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett; created and trained on Kamino as part of the Galactic Republic's new military. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Hawk served as a gunship pilot for the Republic Navy.\nDuring the Battle of Christophsis, Hawk flew a LAAT/i gunship when he was called in by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker to rescue him, fellow Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Clone Commander Cody, Clone Captain Rex, and their clone troopers after their position was overrun by Separatist battle droids. As Republic troops were forced to abandon their position, Hawk picked up the survivors on the roof of a building.\nIn 20 BBY, Hawk was present at the Battle of Umbara where he transported clone troopers of the 501st Legion to the surface of Umbara.\nHawk later dropped off Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka Tano, and Rex on the planet Onderon, where they were to train Saw Gerrera and Lux Bonteri's group of rebels that were fighting against the new Separatist leader of the planet.\nIn 19 BBY, Hawk and the rest of Skywalker's fleet were dispatched to retake the Outer Rim planet Scipio, the base-of-operations of the InterGalactic Banking Clan that had recently been occupied by the Confederacy. Upon entering the Scipio system, Hawk and other pilots emerged from the three Venator-class Star Destroyers that had arrived to retake Scipio. General Skywalker, heading to Scipio aboard a gunship, contacted Hawk via comlink, telling the clone pilot that he would need air support once he reached the surface of the planet. Hawk reassured Skywalker, informing the General that he and his wing mates would be ready to fly in support of the General when he need it. Hawk and the other pilots proceeded to engage with the Separatist flotilla's vulture droids in their Clone Z-95 Headhunters. Breaking through the Separatist blockade, Hawk and his comrades were able to reach the atmosphere of the planet. Under orders from Count Dooku, the Separatist blockade proceeded to retreat from Scipio, abandoning the droid forces stationed outside the Main Vault of the InterGalactic Banking Clan on the planet surface.\nHawk first appeared in the August 2008 Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, which served as an introduction to the television series of the same name. Like all clone troopers on the show, Hawk was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.\nHawk was originally slated to die in a scene of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars theatrical film. In the scene, Anakin Skywalker called Hawk for an extraction from the B'omarr Order Monastery on Teth, however, at some point during the extraction, Hawk's gunship would've been shot down by a vulture droid. The sequence was ultimately cut from the movie, saving Hawk from death in the process.",
