 "content": "Hiem Bryl was head of operations for Verga Mer Mining Company's operations on Tilnes. He was a gaunt Sullustan with slightly sunken cheeks. He did not speak Basic well, so he tended to speak slowly. He preferred letting underlings deal with outsiders, but was not sure they would do so appropriately, so he met with those who came to the mines with questions.\nBryl was a fan of Sullustan sports, and kept images and trophies of such sporting events in his office. He was an accomplished deep-miner, with a degree from a mining school on Sullust. He was popular with his workers, and was able to motivate them easily.",
