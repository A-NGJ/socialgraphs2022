 "content": "Dowron was a Duros who settled on the planet Artorias sometime after the Battle of Endor. By 6 ABY, he had taken a slave named Nina. When Atorias' King Caled Galfridian found out, he stormed into Dowron's compound and demanded that Dowron free her. Dowron tried to bargain with the king, and even offered to let him borrow her, but Caled, disinterested, ordered him to deactivate her kill chip. As the Duros did so, Nina immediately attacked him. She then told Caled to leave, and killed Dowron with her bare hands. Afterward, Caled ordered Dowron's followers to leave Artorias.",
