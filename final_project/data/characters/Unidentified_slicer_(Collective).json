 "content": "A human non-binary slicer worked for the Collective, an underground organization on the planet Corellia. On behalf of the Collective, they visited the Dead Aeronaut cantina for a lunchtime meeting with Monti Calay, a cadet who worked in the Records Department of the Corellian Engineering Corporation. Calay had stolen a First Order datapad from his supervisor, Executive Records Officer Winshur Bratt, that contained an encrypted list of the First Order's targets and prisoners. The slicer used a key obtained by a friend from Doaba Guerfel to decrypt the list. Calay then gave it to the Collective benefactor Nifera Shu, who put it up for auction.\nThe slicer had freckled, light brown skin; green eyes; and brown hair. Their hair was worn long on one side and shaved completely on the other, which was tattooed with the white-horned serpent symbol of the Collective.\nTo avoid facial recognition by the First Order's cams, they outlined their eyes with thick white liner and wore a white scarf that could be pulled over their features. They also wore white gloves with a gray jacket and pants. The ensemble contributed to Calay's impression that the slicer had the appearance of a criminal.\nThe slicer was capable of completing a decryption in approximately six minutes.\nThe slicer appeared in the 2019 novel Resistance Reborn, which was written by Rebecca Roanhorse.",
