 "content": "Dakk'ik was a male Jawa scavenger from Tatooine. At some point after 3636 BBY he was recruited into the crew of Blizz, one of the few Jawas who took the salvaging beyond the sands of Tatooine and into the wider galaxy, and took his pet Womp rat Scabby with him. In 3631 BBY the crew was working on Hoth, where they had a work assignment from Languss Tuno, though Scabby could not survive the cold temperature of Hoth and perished. The Commander of the Anti-Zakuul Alliance showed up to recruit Blizz and his crew to their cause and Blizz agreed on the condition that the stranger would help them complete their current job first. Dakk'ik received the \"sniff-machine\" to help him deal with Scabby's death and later joined the rest of his crew in the assault on the encampment of Ugnaughts, who held the box their client was after. After the box was retrieved and their job completed, Blizz accepted the new job and the entire crew traveled with him to Odessen.\nDakk'ik appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during the Blizz Alliance alert mission.",
