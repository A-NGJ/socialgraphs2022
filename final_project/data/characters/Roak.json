 "content": "Roak was a male Human who served as the first officer aboard a Rebel Alliance blockade runner commanded by Captain Chedaki. In 3 ABY, the ship was assigned to take Princess Leia Organa to the Shiva system, in order to investigate suspicious Imperial activity in the remote region. However, when Organa and Chedaki attempted to scan the inhabited Shiva IV in the ship's shuttle, they ran into an unseen anti-matter bomb that killed Chedaki and damaged the blockade runner. Roak immediately took charge of the situation, but his efforts to retrieve Organa were hampered by the blast's effect on the shuttle's firing circuits. Instead, Organa crashed her shuttle on the planet below, a decision which saved the ship.\nRoak appeared in Star Wars 53: The Last Gift from Alderaan, written by Chris Claremont and released in 1981.",
