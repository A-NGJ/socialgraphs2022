 "content": "Susejo was the sarlacc of the Great Pit of Carkoon. Formerly a male Choi, Susejo fell victim to the Great Pit of Carkoon on Tatooine before his conciousness was merged with that of the sarlacc.\nThe very young Susejo fell into the sarlacc pit around four thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. After being swallowed by the sarlacc, he passed time by trading stories with another Jedi who shared his fate. By 4 ABY, his personality had merged with that of the sarlacc, which had digested him alive for thousands of years whilst it absorbed his consciousness. Thus, Susejo's personality embodied the creature, rendering it indistinguishable from the ancient sentient. Susejo introduced himself to Boba Fett when the bounty hunter suffered the same fate.\nThroughout Fett's stay, Susejo/the sarlacc and Fett had several lengthy conversations. It was by goading Susejo that Fett made the sarlacc contract around his jetpack, creating a means of escape.\nFett returned a year after his escape to taunt Susejo and the sarlacc, promising to eventually destroy them one day.\nSusejo made his first, and only, appearance in the 1996 short story \"A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett\", written by Daniel Keys Moran under the pseudonym of \"J.D. Montgomery\" and published as part of the Tales from Jabba's Palace anthology. Keys Moran initially intended for the sarlacc to be sentient, but ultimately gave its contribution to the story to Susejo when Lucasfilm Ltd. vetoed the possibility of the sarlacc being intelligent.",
