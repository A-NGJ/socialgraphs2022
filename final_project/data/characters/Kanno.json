 "content": "Kanno was a male Human Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. He had a daughter on Korriban and considered bringing a Selonian as a pet to her.\nIn 3640 BBY, Kanno was among the Sith that invaded Corellia under the leadership of Darth Decimus. When a group of Selonian warriors in Axial Park began to threaten the Imperial occupation forces there, Kanno recruited an Imperial hero to assault their warren and eradicate the natives.\nKanno was a male Human who held prejudiced views against Selonians, frequently referring them as \"strays\" as the Sith Lord saw their staunch stance against Imperial intrusion and their warrior's ways as savagery.",
