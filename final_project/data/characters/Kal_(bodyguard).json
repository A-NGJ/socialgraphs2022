 "content": "Kal was a muscular male Human that served as a bodyguard to Jedi Master Kai Hudorra following his acquisition of The Lucky Twi'lek on Kestavel.\nWhen Dass Jennir, Beyghor Sahdett, and the crew of the Uhumele arrived at the casino in search of Hudorra, Kal and his partner, Urtsk, backed the already imposing Bothan up, greatly intimidating Meekerdin-maa. When Sahdett betrayed Hudorra and Jennir, Kal was among the guards that surrounded the Dark Jedi. Following the bisection of Urtsk and guardswoman Makall, Bomo Greenbark utilized his Nosaurian flash ability, blinding the Verpine. Kal lunged at the former Jedi Master, but missed himself, losing his vibro-ax to Sahdett's lightsaber. Before he could be killed, however, the Nosaurian grabbed Kal's hip blaster, distracting him long enough for the Jedi to defeat him.\nHe and Greenbark would then attempt to interrogate a bound Sahdett, but the Verpine refused to talk to them owing to their lack of Force-sensitivity. Only after Hudorra and Jennir arrived did Sahdett explain his fall to the dark side after being seduced by Emperor Palpatine.\nLater, when Hudorra tried to force his remaining staff to flee in advance of the upcoming Imperial attack, Kal, along with Bryti, Shaylai Veila, Dayn, and Nira, reaffirmed their loyalty to the Jedi Master, refusing to abandon him. As such, Kal helped plan the ambush on Darth Vader, whom they assumed was coming to deal with the Jedi personally. Kal and Veila later helped seal the casino entranceway with concrete. Kal sat at Hudorra's left side during a final feast, where the Bothan told everyone that only he and Jennir would be staying.\nLater, as Vader and his stormtroopers marched across the bridge to the casino, Kal was already aboard the Uhumele and caught the ziplining Greenbark, the last crewmember to evacuate. Kal would later be witness to Hudorra's final message, recorded on a holodisc given to Jennir by Bryti, wishing that the Force be with him.",
