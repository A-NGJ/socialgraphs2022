Devonan was killed during the Battle of Corellia by Imperial forces who took the files, but not before the Imperials had to steal a Czerka ion round from the courtyard to destroy the main structure of the tower on which the Czerka employee stood, forcing Devonan from her metal platform which she was repairing into a lethal confrontation.\nArmin Devonan sported a blaster rifle and a light leather armor. She was also equipped with grenades and a repair tool which emmitted a red-beam.",
