 "content": "Tauntaza was a human female member of the Galactic Empire who served as governor of the planet Gabredor III. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the governor began to use the services of the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate to help her consolidate her power and began to neglect the individuals who lived on Gabredor III, including a colony of refugees, and the planet itself, which was suffering from a drought and was drying up as a result.\nThe Imperial governor was first mentioned in a StarWars.com article published on March 15, 2022 previewing the comic solicitations for June 2022. In twenty-third of Star Wars: Darth Vader, that was published by Marvel Comics on June 1, the governor is mistakenly referred to as a male in one panel.",
