 "content": "Kile Hannad was a Royal Guard who survived the aftermath of the Emperor's defeat at Byss and death on Onderon.\nWhen the guardsmen met at Yinchorr and decided to avenge Palpatine by killing the traitor Carnor Jax, they were attacked almost immediately by a swarm of stormtroopers. Although the guardsmen fought ferociously, killing dozens of stormtroopers, they were eventually overwhelmed until only two remained: Kile Hannad and Kir Kanos. With the flip of a coin, Hannad stayed to fight while Kanos escaped. Hannad's sacrifice allowed Kanos the chance to exact revenge against Jax.\nIn the audio dramatization of the Star Wars: Crimson Empire series, Kile Hannad is portrayed as the Royal Guard who was with Palpatine on Onderon and brought news of Carnor Jax's betrayal to his brothers on Yinchorr. However, Crimson Empire 3 portrays the survivor of Onderon as a separate character, who is killed during the ambush on Yinchorr before Hannad.",
