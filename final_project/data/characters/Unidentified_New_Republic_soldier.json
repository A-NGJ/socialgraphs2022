 "content": "A human male soldier served in the New Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry during the Galactic Civil War. Around 5 ABY, while the company was deployed on the planet Troithe, he and half a dozen other soldiers talked with some pilots from the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron. The soldier inquired whether Troithe's governor was the next target, claiming that the galactic capital Coruscant was the 61st's next target.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the soldier served in the New Republic's 61st Mobile Infantry. Around 5 ABY, he was present with the company on the planet Troithe in the Cerberon system. One evening, the soldier joined half a dozen comrades in meeting with some pilots from the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron around a table in a refugee camp on the planet. One of the pilots, Nath Tensent, passed out Imperial rations. The soldier asked Alphabet Leader, Lieutenant Yrica Quell, if it was true that the 61st was going for Troithe's Imperial governor, Hastemoor. The lieutenant inclined her head, and the soldier swore, predicting that they might win over the system.\nChass na Chadic, another Alphabet jokingly asked whether the soldier did not want the system to be won, and he laughed, remarking that the 61st's next assignment would just come sooner as a result. When the final Alphabet pilot, Wyl Lark, asked where the next assignment was, the soldier claimed that the New Republic High Command was testing tactics with the 61st on Troithe to prepare the company to deploy on the galactic capital, Coruscant. Quell said that the soldiers better succeed the first time if it was practice, drawing laughter from the soldiers. The group around the table continued to talk through the evening.\nThe soldier was a human male with olive skin and gray hair. He had a high-pitched lilt in his voice. The soldier believed that the 61st was being used as a trial in preparation for a deployment on Coruscant. He was sure to inquire with Yrica Quell on whether the governor was the company's next target, believing that Coruscant would come soon if so.\nThe New Republic soldier appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed.",
