 "content": "Monthan was the eldest child and only son of the king of the planet Shu-Torun and stood to inherit the throne upon his father's death. When the king decided to rebel against the Galactic Empire and attempt to assassinate their representative, the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Monthan and his sister Hollian stood with their father in the Shu-Torun royal palace's throne room while their sister Trios was sent to lead Vader into a trap. Monthan did not attempt to stop his father from sacrificing Trios in order to kill Vader, and the prince was killed soon after when Vader's assassin droid BT-1 murdered everyone in the palace throne room.\nMonthan was the princely heir to the throne of the Mid Rim mining planet Shu-Torun during the reign of his father as king. He had two younger sisters, the elder Princess Hollian, who stood to inherit the title of celebrant warlord of the planet's War-Faith, and the younger Princess Trios. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Shu-Torun provided ore for Imperial building projects, but when the planet's ore-dukes became displeased with the Empire's required tithes after the Battle of Yavin, the king chose to rebel.\nThe Empire responded by dispatching the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader to investigate why Shu-Torun was not meeting its ore quotas, and the king devised a plan to assassinate their visitor, which involved Trios leading Vader into a trap while Monthan, Hollian, and the king watched from the throne room. The plan began well enough, with Trios guiding Vader into the Shu-Torun royal palace's subterranean abyssal rooms, where a ball was being held; however, when assassins working for the king, but pretending to be rebels against both him and the Empire, ambushed Vader, the Sith Lord easily killed them all.\nTrios then enacted the suicidal backup plan, in which she led Vader into the palace's tunnels to be killed by molten lava. Monthan stood by the king's side as his father lamented having to sacrifice Trios and did not prevent him from activating the system that would deliver the lava and kill his sibling. Vader was able to once again escape from the king's trap, bringing Trios with him as he cut his way out of the tunnel using his lightsaber. With no further traps, the king demanded that Monthan and everyone else in the throne room prepare a defense, knowing that Vader would be headed straight for them.\nHowever, the prince was never given the chance to face Vader in combat, as the Sith Lord's assassin droids, BT-1 and 0-0-0, had infiltrated the throne room. After 0-0-0 gave up on trying to poison the king, BT-1 resorted to opening fire on the room's occupants. The droid shot Monthan, the king, Hollian, and all of the guards present directly in the heart, killing each of them instantly. Vader then brought Trios into the throne room and revealed her family's deaths to her, crowning her and leaving her to rule Shu-Torun as the new queen.\nMonthan was a human male with blond hair and fair skin. He did not protest when his father attempted to sacrifice his sister Trios in order to kill Darth Vader.\nMonthan wore white armor with golden trim and a blue cloak.\nMonthan first appeared in Darth Vader Annual 1, a comic book released in 2015. The story was written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu.",
