 "content": "Tanka was a Trandoshan who was a member of the Revengers, a group who fought against the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate. After Crimson Dawn destroyed the village where Tanka and Ankala Sahm resided, the two joined with S'ira, whose own village had been destroyed by the syndicate, to form the organization, making their goal to seek out locations where Crimson Dawn was operating and attack its operatives. While on Calior, where Chief Regional Auditor Cygnus Anton of the Galactic Empire was making demands to the locals while accompanied by Crimson Dawn enforcers, the Revengers were assisted by servants of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was also embarking on a quest to eliminate the syndicate. Tanka and the other members of the Revengers were recruited by Vader as part of his quest.",
