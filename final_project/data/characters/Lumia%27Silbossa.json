 "content": "Lumia'Silbossa was a Twi'lek female who resided on Ryloth before the fall of the Galactic Republic.\nLike so many female Twi'leks, Lumia was sold into slavery during her adolescent years. It was not until Lumia was older that the Jedi Master Vhiin Thorla rescued her from her life as a slave. Like all the slaves that Master Thorla rescued, he offered Lumia a place at his refuge called The Enclave. Lumia accepted the offer whole-heartedly and took up residence at Thorla's refuge. She soon became The Enclave's healer, tending to the all manor of wounds sustained by life in the Bright Lands of Ryloth. Lumia also showed a measure of Force sensitivity which allowed her to better assist those in need.",
