 "content": "The Clenched Fist of Hate was a dark side Force user and an unwilling follower of Exar Kun.\nBefore becoming an unwilling follower of Exar Kun, the Clenched Fist of Hate was a student at Corellia University, and may have been a member of an archeological expedition on Yavin 4 in 1 ABY that unknowingly tunneled into the tombs below the Temple of Exar Kun and released the Sith Lord's spirit. The evil spirit bound the students and researchers to his will, and inducted them into the Cult of Exar Kun. Afterward, he sent them to Talus, to the Corellia University research outpost they had originally come from to enslave the rest of the people there. The majority of them were then sent back to Yavin 4.\nAfter losing contact with the outpost and fearing the worst, Professor Cornelius Wagglehorn hired a group of spacers to travel to Talus and investigate. After arriving at the research outpost and discovering what had happened, the spacers informed the professor. He sent them the location of the tomb and implored them to travel there and destroy the malevolent spirit.\nThe Clenched Fist was the fourth major enemy the group encountered, having previously encountered and defeated the Open Hand of Hate, the Minder of Weak Wills, and the Caretaker of the Lost Souls. The Clenched Fist would prove to be their biggest challenge yet. After sending six of his tomb guardian minions after the spacers, two at a time, the Clenched Fist launched his attack at the group, brandishing a long, two-handed sword of Massassi construction, and constantly setting many of the spacers ablaze with the Force. After a long battle, with many burns and blade cuts suffered by the ragtag group of spacers, the Clenched Fist was finally killed, his spirit fleeing from the grasp of Exar Kun. After his death, the spacers were free to challenge Exar Kun's spirit directly.\nThe Clenched Fist of Hate was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Clenched Fist of Hate was added to the game as part of the \"Exar Kun\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 9\" update, on April 3, 2008.\nThe Clenched Fist of Hate was a \"boss\" enemy NPC in the Temple of Exar Kun Heroic Encounter. He was the fourth encounter in the instance, coming after the Open Hand of Hate, the Minder of Weak Wills and the Caretaker of Lost Souls.",
