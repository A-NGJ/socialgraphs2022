 "content": "Kerek was a male Human bounty hunter who worked as the chief enforcer of the Hutt crime lord Kaltho's criminal empire during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. When Kaltho traveled to Cloud City on the planet Bespin to bid on the Jewel of Yavin, a corusca gem, Kerek accompanied him to make the locals fear the Hutt's power. While in Cloud City Kerek moved between various locations where he could spread fear, including the Four-and-a-Half cantina. The bounty hunter however, was not overly loyal to Kaltho and was willing to provide information on his boss for credits or information on a good bounty.\nA group of spacers planning to manipulate the bidding for the jewel and then steal it contacted Kerek, and the hunter provided them with information on Kaltho that might aid them in their plan.\nKerek first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game. Players have the option of finding Kerek and gaining information on Kaltho from him, which this article assumes they successfully did.",
