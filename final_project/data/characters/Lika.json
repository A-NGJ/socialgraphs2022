 "content": "Lika was a female Terrelian Jango Jumper who was captured during the Clone Wars, a conflict fought between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, by Trandoshan big game hunters, who transported her, along with several other prisoners, to the Trandoshan moon of Wasskah to be hunted for sport. The Trandoshans deposited Lika and the others on Island Four and immediately opened fire, killing several prisoners instantly while she and Katt Mol, a Snivvian, escaped into the jungle. The next day, she and Mol were wandering through the jungle when they were fired upon by a Trandoshan hunter named Ratter, instantly killing the Snivvian. Lika attempted to flee, but she was shot dead by Ratter's partner, Sochek.\nLika first appeared, albeit unidentified, in \"Padawan Lost,\" the twenty first episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season, which originally aired on April 1, 2011, and was first identified in its episode guide on StarWars.com. Lika's character model was based on that of Cassie Cryar, a Terrelian Jango Jumper who appeared in \"Lightsaber Lost,\" the eleventh episode of The Clone Wars' second season, which originally aired on January 22, 2010.",
