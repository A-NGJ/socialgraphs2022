 "content": "Gorn was a human male dissident during the height of the Galactic Empire who served as a lieutenant in the Imperial Army local garrison on Aldhani.\nWhile stationed on Aldhani, Gorn fell in love with a local woman, who was eventually killed at the hands of the Galactic Empire. Following that, he lost faith in the regime and became a spy and an inside man for Vel Sartha, and was part of her team that partook in a mission on Aldhani. He was shot and killed during the raid when the rebel team was discovered by Corporal Kimzi.\nGorn was respected by the men serving under him. Although he was a firm commander, he was also thoughtful. Although initially loyal to the Empire, he became disillusioned with their rule and grew to despise the Imperials, particularly his superior officer, Commandant Jayhold Beehaz.\nGorn was portrayed by Sule Rimi in the television series Andor.",
