 "content": "Borosiv was a Quesoth male from the planet Quethold and a member of the Circling of the First of the Red Quesoth caste, which bred more of the Quesoth insectoid species and advised the Queen of the Red, the Quesoth leader. In 8 ABY, the Quesoth Trevik became the Queen's bowlcarrier, carrying a bowl of nectar for her while following her and Borosiv's litters.\nThe Circling ordered the bowlcarrier to straighten up, follow the Workers' stance, and rise the monarch's bowl higher, which Trevik did. The following day, Borosiv joined the Queen's escort and was killed along with the Queen shortly after by her ally, the alien warlord Nuso Esva, during a battle between Esva and the Queen's forces and the Empire of the Hand. Borosiv spoke Quesoth Common Speak with a low voice.\nBorosiv appeared in the novella Crisis of Faith, written by Timothy Zahn and published in 2011 as part of the 20th Anniversary Edition of the 1991 novel Heir to the Empire.",
