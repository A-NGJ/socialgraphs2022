 "content": "Charpp was a Human male security guard stationed at the Chancellor Palpatine Spaceport on the planet Coruscant. He was a great admirer of the Jedi and possessed great knowledge about their Order.\nWhile heading to the planet Vjun during a secret mission, Jedi Master Maks Leem was routed to Charpp's station for inspection. Using his security scanner, Charpp recognized her hidden lightsaber for what it was, then concluded that Leem was a Jedi and offered her his help on her mission. Leem pretended to know beforehand that Charpp was a Jedi supporter, and that she was intentionally sent to his security line to maintain her cover. Charpp believed the tale and was pleased that he was able to help a Jedi complete a mission.\nA Human male, Charpp worked at the Chancellor Palpatine Spaceport on the galactic capital Coruscant as a security guard. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Charpp had a strong fascination in the Jedi Order and gathered a great deal of knowledge about its members.\nIn 19 BBY, Charpp was stationed at security point eleven of the spaceport. He chanced upon Jedi Master Maks Leem, who had lined up for his station. The Jedi Master was at that time working undercover for a mission, which required passage to the planet Vjun. Charpp took Leem aside after scanning the Jedi and told her that he recognized the unique signature readings of her hidden lightsaber, thus deducing that Leem was a Jedi.\nWhen Leem confirmed her identity, Charpp became excited at the opportunity of meeting an actual Jedi and readily offered his help on her mission. Faced with an overeager admirer, Leem pretended that the Order knew Charpp was a loyal supporter of the Jedi, and that they specifically chose his security line for her to go through, knowing that he would not blow her cover. Ecstatic that he was able to help the Jedi on her mission, Charpp allowed Leem to go on her way.\nIn 19 BBY, Charpp was middle-aged, with black and white-streaked hair that was cut in a military buzz. He had a double chin and tended to sweat a lot. Charpp had a strong admiration for the Jedi Order and strove to know as much as he could about them, to the point of watching the play Jedi! at least fifteen times and trading information about the Order with other like-minded individuals. Charpp refused to believe that the Jedi would compromise their ideals to serve as Chancellor Palpatine's secret police. When presented with the opportunity to speak to a real Jedi like Maks Leem, he became highly excited and volunteered his assistance to Leem's mission, going so far as disregarding his own safety and assuring the Jedi that he would do anything to help.\nCharpp is a character created by author Sean Stewart for the 2004 novel Yoda: Dark Rendezvous.",
