 "content": "Barin Trevina was a male Balosar and accomplished thief. He was born on Balosar but soon migrated to Mos Eisley on Tatooine in search of opportunities. He was known for his ability to get in and out of tight spaces. He bragged he could enter and leave any building in Mos Eisley and often would wager on the success of his \"expeditions.\"\nTrevina was short and thin, and wore his hair short. He was a favored employee of Prello the Hutt.",
