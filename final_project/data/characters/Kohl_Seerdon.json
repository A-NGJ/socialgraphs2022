 "content": "Kohl Seerdon was a Human male Moff who served in the Galactic Empire and was aware of the tactics of Rogue Squadron during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn the time of the Galactic Republic, Kohl Seerdon was a military officer from Chandrila. During the Clone Wars, he replaced Hiram Drayson as commander of Chandrila's defense forces.\nWhen Emperor Palpatine declared his Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Seerdon was made Moff of Sector 3 and assumed the role of commander of the 3rd Sector Army. Seerdon later arranged for his son, Maximillian, to have a ranking position in the Imperial Security Bureau.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Seerdon held control over the gas giant Taloraan and its tibanna gas mines. He also had a Weapons Research Facility on the planet Fest. During the war, Seerdon started consolidating forces to take over Rebel Alliance bacta supplies on Thyferra. The Rebel Alliance watched his moves closely. He was one of the most dangerous enemies of the Rebel Alliance flight group Rogue Squadron months after the Battle of Yavin.\nAfter Rogue Squadron attacked the snow planet Fest and destroyed his research facility, Seerdon attacked and blockaded a city on Chandrila, home planet of Mon Mothma and Seerdon himself. Rogue Squadron halted his attack, forcing Seerdon, who was overseeing the attack, to flee in a Lambda-class shuttle. While Rogue Squadron launched a retaliatory raid on a Capacitor on the planet Sullust, Seerdon invaded Thyferra and took control of the planet's bacta factories. Rogue Squadron counter-attacked, outmaneuvering Seerdon's forces.\nAfter losing control of the captured bacta, Seerdon engaged Rogue Leader Luke Skywalker in his heavily modified Sentinel-class landing craft. After a harrowing dogfight, Commander Luke Skywalker defeated him. The shuttle exploded, instantly killing the Imperial Moff, resulting in a Rebel victory.\nMoff Seerdon was unforgiving to those who failed him, and considered it the way of the universe that the weak should give away to the strong. He was also greedy.\nSeerdon serves as the main antagonist in the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron. Kohl Seerdon was voiced by Neil Ross.\nSeerdon is also one of the Imperials in the skirmish mode of Star Wars: Force Commander.",
