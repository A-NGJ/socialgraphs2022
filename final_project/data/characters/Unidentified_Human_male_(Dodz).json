 "content": "An old man lived on the planet Dodz. In 15 BBY, the wizened Human tried to encourage the young boy Jost Ellon to fight back against the ruling governor, Kugg, who had been imposing heavy, unfair taxes; the man reminded Ellon that their ancestors had fought hard to free their land in the first place, so it was only right that they continued battling. He also implored Ellon to follow his heart. The old man had white hair that included a full beard as well as light skin, sporting green clothing and shoes while carrying a wooden staff.\nThe old man appeared in the first issue of the Star Wars: Droids comic series, which was written by David Manak, illustrated by John Romita, and published by Marvel Comics in 1986.",
