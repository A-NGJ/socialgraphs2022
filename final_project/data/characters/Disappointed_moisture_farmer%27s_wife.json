 "content": "The disappointed moisture farmer's wife was the wife of a Human farmer on Tatooine. Along with the rest of the family, she was disappointed to learn that her husband had not been able to purchase any droids from a clan of Jawas.\nThis individual only appears in the story Oh!! Jawajawa, published in Star Wars Manga: Silver issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical.",
