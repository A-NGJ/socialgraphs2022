 "content": "Roskin was a Human woman from Sulon who served as a sympathizer of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early Galactic Civil War.\nShe was somehow involved to a protest demonstration in the capital of Barons Hed, but after the retaliatory Sulon massacre by the Galactic Empire, local leader Morgan Katarn took her, her three children and hundreds of other Rebel sympathizers to an abandoned space station, and later boarded the Cyclops to Ruusan in 1 BBY.\nShe was in the first load of the two shuttles that brought the colonist refugees planetside. Morgan was with them and noticed how her children troubled her while they tried board through the airlock; he lifted the youngest one into his arms, offering to help her. Morgan secured the toddler into a seat, and kept him occuped with a multi-tool he was carrying.\nThey settled Fort Nowhere. Years later, she was killed during a ensuing battle in the Fort while her children remained safe.",
