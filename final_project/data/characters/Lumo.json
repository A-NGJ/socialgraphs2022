 "content": "Lumo was a male Human living on Rishi during the Galactic War. At some point he was enslaved by Nova Blades pirates and forced to mine Exonium for them. In 3637 BBY an individual incited a rebellion among the slaves kept by Nova Blades on a remote island, but Lumo warned their rescuer that Slavemaster Kendruh kept the records of the slaves' families to punish them in case the slaves rebelled and escaped. After the individual killed Kendruh and retrieved his journal, Lumo and the other slaves joined the rebellion in full force.\nLumo appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
