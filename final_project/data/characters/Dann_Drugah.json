 "content": "Dann Drugah was a shy droid expert who was part of the FarStar crew during the hunt for Moff Kentor Sarne.\nIn 8 ABY, Drugah worked in a repair shop on Kal'Shebbol. Following the liberation of the planet by the New Republic, he signed onto the crew of the FarStar. He didn't seek fortune or revenge, or even to see new worlds. His only goal was to be left alone with his droids. He was possibly assigned as the ship's chief droid technician.\nDrugah was a reserved Human, and was only active and friendly when surrounded by droids. He considered droids to be his best friends, and was awkward when talking with living beings. He was adamant about not damaging other beings and always rejected blasters that were offered to him.",
