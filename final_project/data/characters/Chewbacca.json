 "content": "Chewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee male warrior, smuggler, mechanic, pilot, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, the Cold War, and the subsequent First Order-Resistance War. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces of the Kachirho Wookiee Militia during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi General Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Chieftain and General Tarfful, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.\nIn the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by Corporal Han Solo, becoming his co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon during coaxium run for Crimson Dawn with Tobias Beckett and Qi'ra. Winning the Falcon from Landonis Balthazar Calrissian, they later worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba the Hutt until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.\nThroughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Calrissian on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. The Emperor was killed for the first time aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.\nAfter Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To on the Falcon, where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the Falcon, including piloting the ship to aid the Resistance during the Battle of Crait.\nRoughly a year after the battle of Crait, Chewbacca was one of the last of the Resistance. Having learned of the mysterious return of the Emperor, Chewbacca and the crew of the Falcon, now including Poe Dameron, traveled to the planets Pasaana and Kijimi to find a clue to how to find where the Emperor was hiding, being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Chewbacca's death, as Rey, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Kylo Ren and destroyed a First Order transport that she had thought Chewbacca had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.\nHowever, Chewbacca survived and was rescued by the Resistance as they continued the quest. Rey eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Sith, and led the charge during the battle that ensued later on. Rey ultimately killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned Ben Solo in the climax of the battle, while the Resistance, joined by the Citizens' Fleet, progressively overpowered the Sith Eternal's Final Order fleet that the Emperor planned to unleash.\nHaving destroyed the Sith once and for all, the Resistance reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light.\nA Wookiee male, Chewbacca, nicknamed \"Chewie,\" hailed from Kashyyyk, a peaceful planet where he was born in the city of Rwookrrorro, one hundred and eighty years before the Clone Wars to Attichitcuk and a female Wookiee. He was married to a female named Mallatobuck, and had a family to support, including a son named Lumpawaroo. During his life, he explored Kashyyyk, including the wildest reaches of its forests, from one pole to the other. His exploration hardened his footpads.\nAt some point during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists, Chewbacca famously shielded his allies. He served as a combat engineer while other Wookiee soldiers led the charge in battle. In 20 BBY, he was captured by a Trandoshan hunting guild led by Garnac; taken to Island Four on Wasskah to be their prey, his transport was attacked by a trio of Jedi apprentices—the Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the younglings Jinx and O-Mer, also prey of the Trandoshans.\nChewbacca escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio  to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a transmitter to contact his people on his nearby homeworld; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Chewbacca joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Wookiee relief force led by General Tarfful—who had received Chewbacca's transmission—as well as bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas. Once all the Trandoshans had been killed, Chewbacca and the Wookiees accompanied the young Jedi to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they parted ways.\nDuring the last days of the war, Lieutenant Chewbacca was a major player in the Battle of Kashyyyk, overseeing the confrontation between the Grand Army of the Republic and the invading Separatist Droid Army alongside Tarfful and Jedi General Yoda, as well as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli. Following the implementation of Order 66, Chewbacca and Tarfful witnessed the assassination attempt on Yoda by Commander Gree and his aide; he helped the Jedi Grand Master elude the clone troopers and escape from the planet.\nFollowing the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca saw his people sent to work as slaves, or as miners in places such as Kessel, or made to serve as science experiments. A year into the Empire's reign, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the very same Force-sensitive Chewbacca had met on Wasskah, pondered what had happened to him after reading updates on the state of Kashyyyk, starting to lose her hope that he remained free.\nAt some point, while on the run from Imperial forces, Chewbacca and several other Wookiees were captured and enslaved by several Trandoshan slavers. Like them, he was forced into slavery, working to cut the wroshyr trees in order to feed the Imperial Army. Chewbacca temporarily escaped but was turned over to the Empire by a back-stabbing and greedy Kowakian monkey-lizard bounty hunter. Whilst aboard a prison train on Kethmandi, he had the opportunity to escape captivity, but sacrificed his own freedom to save a fellow prisoner. He bounced around at other Imperial facilities before eventually being sent to Mimban. Whilst on Mimban, he came to be referred to as \"the Beast.\" Chewbacca also learned that the Imperials were trying to sell him off as a pit fighter.\nIn 10 BBY, after Han Solo was denounced as a deserter by Tobias Beckett, a criminal impersonating an Imperial officer, his commanding officer decided to execute him by giving him to \"the beast.\" While imprisoned in an underground holding cell, Han used his knowledge of Shyriiwook to convince Chewbacca to stage a fight with him after realizing that one of the supports in the cell was weak, and that destroying it would allow them to escape imprisonment. Following their escape, the pair managed to join a reluctant gang. Chewbacca, grateful for Solo's intervention, proclaimed a life debt to the outlaw. Chewbacca thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.\nChewbacca and Han began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett's crew. The group were hired by Crimson Dawn to steal a train car of refined coaxium on Vandor. However, they failed due to the intervention of Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders, and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Chewbacca promised Dryden Vos of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious Kessel Run. Vos sent Qi'ra, who had become his top lieutenant, with them.\nKnowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to Lando Calrissian. Solo played Calrissian in a game of \"Corellian Spike\" sabacc, with the stakes being Calrissian's YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.\nChewbacca, Solo, Qi'ra, Calrissian, and Beckett stole the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian's navigational droid, L3-37. During the escape, Solo flew the Falcon, with Chewbacca as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium fuel as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on Savareen in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called the Maw, reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.\nUpon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew was confronted by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.\nHowever, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Chewbacca as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Chewbacca were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' yacht to meet Crimson Dawn leader Maul. Solo and Chewbacca entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.\nSolo and Chewbacca tracked down Calrissian to Numidian Prime. Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve, and challenged him to a rematch of sabacc for the Falcon, a game which Solo won fairly. The Falcon instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their new-found ship and confidence, Solo and Chewbacca began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers. Around the same time, Chewbacca likewise hung a pair of chance cube dice above the freighter's piloting console.\nWith the Falcon as their ship, the two smugglers took on many jobs over the ensuring years. They also came to meet the Tonnika sisters, though their relationship with the siblings soured over the course of their work together, and fellow smuggler Dash Rendar. At some point, Chewbacca also told Tivoche Bilure about what happened to Kashyyyk after the Clone Wars.\nAt one point, Han Solo and Chewbacca were transporting two tons of Cordaxian ore on Odona, with the help of Frax, a Kajain'sa'Nikto. They were being pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Imperial prison, pulled a blaster on Han. Chewbacca did a barrel roll with the Millennium Falcon, knocking Frax out of the ship entirely. They successfully escaped the Empire and Odona, but left Frax behind.\nSolo and Chewbacca were later smuggling some Imperial cargo for Jabba the Hutt when they were stopped by an Imperial blockade. They started being chased by several TIE fighters, and they were faced with a choice: surrender, or drop the Imperial cargo. Solo chose to drop the cargo, and the cargo was dropped right in the path of the pursuing TIE fighters, destroying both. Without being pursued, Solo and Chewbacca flew down to the nearby planet, the Falcon heavily damaged.\nOnce landing, they began making repairs, until they found out that the planet was inhabited by the crime lord Nodo. Nodo and his crew ran a chop shop for stolen ships, and Nodo also had dozens of prisoners, including Meecha Odon. Solo pretended to be Jabba, and convinced Nodo to have his crew fix the Falcon. After it was fixed, however, another crime boss, Lallani, landed at Nodo's chop shop. Lallani had heard Jabba was there, and wanted to capture him.\nA battle broke loose, and in the chaos, Solo and Chewbacca freed Odon and the other prisoners. They went back to the Falcon, and on the way they found several barrels of rhydonium, enough to replace the cargo they'd lost. However, Chewbacca convinced Solo that Odon and the prisoners needed the fuel more, and Solo relented. They gave up the fuel they desperately needed, so that Odon could use the fuel to pay for her and the other prisoners' way home.\nIn 9 BBY, as they were unloading the rhydonium from the Falcon at Valtos space port, Zuckuss and 4-LOM attacked them. They revealed that Han and Chewbacca had a bounty on their head, put there by Nodo himself. Zuckuss managed to put Han into the Mist Hunter's hold, but Chewbacca attacked Zuckuss in order to rescue Solo and Beris Ford, Zuckuss's other prisoner, from the bounty hunters. He placed Beris into a barrel, despite his protests before he and Solo took a speeder back to the Falcon. However, Zuckuss and 4-LOM caught up with, but Chewbacca and Solo were able to use several barrels to knock them down. As they flew Falcon away from Valtos, Chewbacca and Solo ejected Beris' barrel into space with a homing beacon to notify his family. However, they were pursued by Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and their ship, the Mist Hunter.\nChewbacca manned one of the Falcon's laser cannons to fight off the Mist Hunter. Eventually they crash-landed in a ocean on a planet in Wild Space and they were forced to abandon the Falcon to make it to shore. After the Mist Hunter crashed, Chewbacca and Han then Zuckuss behind. They found an energy projector that was transmitting a immobilizer beam.\nSolo and Chewbacca climbed the projector, but were confronted by Zuckuss who tossed spears at them. When Chewbacca go to the top, he was able to turn off the beam by destroying it's power source. However, small droids were activated and wanted to destroy them and all organic life in the galaxy.\nThe two opposing sides decided that it would be best to work together to escape the droids, and they escaped to the Falcon. Han pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the Falcon, jumping into the water below. Solo and Chewbacca left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.\nAt one point, while on Coruscant after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by Alinka Aloo, the daughter of Sim Aloo. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her tower. A week later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a tooka-sitting job for Chewbacca, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Chewbacca went on a cargo ship with the librarian Mayvlin Trillick. But the ship, on autopilot, pulled them into hyperspace. During the unwilling flight, Chewbacca and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet Ushruu. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo prisoner, and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Chewbaccca continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Chewbacca about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo droid, K-2SB, who was actually K-2SO on an undercover mission for Cassian Andor. Eventually, the ship pulled out of hyperspace.\nWhen they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by Janus Greejatus. Trillick and Chewbacca proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an antigrav crate with supplies, including a medkit, and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several Corellian hounds, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the trees, but were attacked by a tongue of the Vathyr, the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Chewbacca managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient book of dark side teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the Enchantress, spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for Emperor Palpatine.\nK-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Chewbacca and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Chewbacca came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to Coruscant. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Corellian hounds that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the Falcon, and fought many TIE fighters to escape Coruscant. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of Oktaro.\nDuring one of their smuggling attempts at the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Millennium Falcon was boarded and the two lost the cargo that they were hauling for their usual employer, Jabba the Hutt. Arriving at Mos Eisley on Tatooine to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. At the bar, Chewbacca was approached by Ben Kenobi, who was searching for passage for himself, Luke Skywalker and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan. Promised 2,000 credits in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Alderaan, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to the commission.\nIn Docking Bay 94, Solo and Chewbacca found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired help. One of them, the famous bounty hunter Boba Fett, kept an eye on Chewbacca, noting the Wookiee getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba. Thus, he moved his arm enough to ensure the Wookiee braids he wore were visible to Chewbacca, which the Wookiee decided to show no reaction to. Ultimately, Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time. After a brief firefight with stormtroopers, the Falcon left Tatooine with its new passengers, escaping from Imperial vessels before entering hyperspace.\nDuring the hyperspace journey, while Kenobi trained Skywalker in the use of the Force, Chewbacca played a game of dejarik with R2-D2, who made a move that Chewbacca disliked. C-3PO advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Chewbacca, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, prompting the two droids to surrender.\nUpon the Falcon's exit from hyperspace, the group found themselves in a meteor storm produced by the destruction of the planet by the Imperial Death Star superweapon. The group were soon caught by the tractor beam of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the Falcon's smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by R2-D2 that Princess Leia Organa was being held in Detention Block AA-23, her execution scheduled. They set out to rescue her, with Chewbacca posing as a prisoner of stormtrooper-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Chewbacca and the others managed to escape from the Death Star—except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with Darth Vader. The Falcon soon arrived to Yavin 4, landing on Rebellion's secret base, just as the Death Star closed in on the moon.\nSkywalker was hopeful that Chewbacca and Solo would join the Rebellion, but Solo was more concerned with receiving his payment in order to pay his debt to Jabba. Though Chewbacca growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Rebel Alliance on its own to deal with the Death Star. They would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin from Vader's TIE Advanced x1, allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive battle station by firing a proton torpedo into its exhaust port.\nBack on Yavin 4, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were both awarded medals by Organa, while Chewbacca howled in delight during the ceremony. The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Alderaan was destroyed, whereas General Dodonna announced their need to evacuate Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location. Chewbacca would be also awarded a medal, and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.\nHowever, before they could depart for Tatooine to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Chewbacca convinced him to accept—to rescue Lieutenant Caluan Ematt from Cyrkon. On the Falcon, the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the Vehement, which they avoided with a false IFF transponder, and landed in Motok. There, they were immediately attacked by some of Jabba's bounty hunters, including Captivator, which prompted Solo to accuse them of being \"Rebels\" and set them against ISB Commander Alecia Beck's garrison.\nChewbacca slipped away with Solo to the Miss Fortune cantina, where they found their old friend Delia Leighton, to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Chewbacca and Solo rented a V-40 and went into a hotel, where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save Curtis's life. However, they escaped and made their way to the Falcon, only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stormtroopers.\nForced to surrender, Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Chewbacca and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo noticed the Miss Fortune making their way to save them, but with the magnetic field activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Chewbacca pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his E-11 medium blaster rifle and destroy the field generators, flooding the hangar with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the Miss Fortune opened fire at the Imperials, and Chewbacca made his way to the Falcon to start the engines while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.\nSoon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the Miss Fortune, they found themselves against the Vehement and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the starfighters, defeating several of them, until the Miss Fortune's took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Chewbacca saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the 1550-LEX space yacht to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the Vehement's tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's atmosphere themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the Falcon at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the Falcon began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.\nSometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the flight stabilizer of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on Andelm IV, Chewbacca went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a Besalisk vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl, Zarro, who tried to sell her stolen speeder bike. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord, Jaum. Chewbacca stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Chewbacca then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.\nAfterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Chewbacca repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Chewbacca and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the Andelm beetle larvae to the Empire to be processed into Dedlanite, a substance used in the manufacture of blasters. To maximise profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.\nThe following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's mine. She got Chewbacca to search for an open air vent for the slave miners to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Chewbacca to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Wookiee was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father Arrax objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.\nBefore Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Chewbacca snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his bowcaster. After meeting Zarro's father, Chewbacca joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down GNK-series power droid and used it to disable a wheeled battle droid. Shortly later, the Wookiee knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power droid. Chewbacca eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's Shistavanen enforcer Tyvak fired on the incendiary larvae with his blaster, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.\nDespite Tyvak's efforts, Chewbacca and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Wookiee's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Chewbacca and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Chewbacca managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Chewbacca encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power droid. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy droid chassis on the man, leaving him behind.\nWhile the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Chewbacca came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Wookiee's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Chewbacca managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Chewbacca then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Chewbacca and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.\nIn truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Chewbacca's support, they traveled to the planet's spaceport. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend Sevox and his protocol droid I-7, who served as the \"eyes\" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Chewbacca came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire. this plan involved fitting a decrepit R5 repair droid with explosives. Sevox thought Chewbacca and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.\nAfter shooing away a group of child beggars, Chewbacca and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new war droid and a hooded alien. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers, Scout troopers, and an AT-ST walker. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an Imperial landing craft. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Chewbacca opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.\nWhile Chewbacca exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 droid \"Boomer\" aboard the shuttle. Chewbacca then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Wookiee however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Imperial walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and \"Boomer.\" The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Imperial Commander Kai, the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.\nPer Commander Kai's orders, Chewbacca and Zarro were transported up to Kai's Imperial Star Destroyer in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to overpower their stormtrooper captors aboard the Imperial shuttle. After landing, Chewbacca knocked out an Imperial RA-7 protocol droid that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.\nZarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel spy and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's \"droid\" \"Boomer\" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to escape on a TIE/sa bomber. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a thermal detonator which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.\nWhile Chewbacca turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the Battle of Yavin. After departing as friends, Chewbacca traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village and gave a child a bandolier that belonged to the child's late father, who was being mourned at the moment. Shortly later, Chewbacca departed aboard the Millennium Falcon. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his IT-O Interrogator.\nChewbacca took part in an assault on Weapons Factory Alpha, on the moon Cymoon 1, alongside the usual team—Solo, Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2—, with Solo posing as the envoy of Jabba the Hutt to enter the factory, Skywalker and Organa disguised as his bodyguards, along with R2-D2. Separately, Chewbacca and C-3PO landed the Falcon in the refuse fields surrounding the factory, with the latter going to a vantage point to observe through the scope of his sniper rifle how Solo engaged Overseer Aggadeen and entered the facilities.\nUnexpectedly, though, Darth Vader arrived on a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, and Chewbacca contacted Solo, telling him to stand down, for firing on the Sith Lord would put the entire moon on alert, but Organa gave the order to take the shot. Chewbacca consented and fired, but Vader sensed danger and deflected the first shot with his lightsaber. He continued shooting, but the Sith Lord had lifted two stormtroopers into the air using the Force and used them as human shields, only for him to topple the building Chewbacca was perched upon. Though it collapsed, the Wookiee escaped from the wreckage. Now being hunted down, Chewbacca lost contact with the team as he made his way to the Falcon.\nWhen he arrived, he discovered C-3PO in pieces strapped and the freighter being dismantled by tentacled aliens. Angered, Chewbacca chased the scavenger away, recovered the protocol droid and made contact with Solo, who along Organa had hijacked an AT-AT and were escaping from Vader. Despite the lengthy time he needed to fix the ship, Chewbacca repaired enough of the Falcon's damage to pilot it to the team's position, where he extracted them and many of the slaves Skywalker had freed. As they began their retreat from Cymoon 1, Organa took over the controls instead of a delirious Solo, so that Chewbacca could repair the hyperdrive, which he managed to do, so that Organa could make the jump into lightspeed and escape a blockade of Star Destroyers.\nWithin two days, the Millennium Falcon rendezvoused with the Alliance Fleet, where Solo was treated for his injuries and Chewbacca and Solo went on to better repair the Falcon on an Alliance Nebulon-B frigate, when the Corellian noted that it had been a miracle that the ship had flown with Chewbacca's rushed repairs, prompting an annoyed reply from the Wookiee, while they strived to repair the Falcon.\nThe need for new parts prompted Solo to go on a mission with Organa, leaving Chewbacca behind with the freighter. However, when he heard that Skywalker had been captured by Grakkus the Hutt on Nar Shaddaa, he volunteered for the rescue mission before Chancellor Mon Mothma, and Generals Dodonna and Gial Ackbar of the Alliance High Command. Taking C-3PO with him, Chewbacca took the Falcon to the moon, wherein the droid did the talking, and the Wookiee used more violent means to interrogate the criminals in search of Skywalker. It was a Zabrak bartender who told them of Skywalker's location on Grakkus's palace and his direction, and Chewbacca and C-3PO set out to Skywalker's encounter. Just as Chewbacca and C-3PO were planning to break into Grakkus's palace, they were attacked by Dengar. Chewbacca fought Dengar until Solo and Organa arrived, and Solo shot Dengar in the back. With Dengar distracted by Solo, Chewbacca used the opportunity to throw Dengar off the building. Chewbacca, Solo, and Organa then went to save Luke from Grakkus, only to find several stormtroopers in the way. R2-D2 acquired a few lightsabers from Grakkus, and they used them to fight the enemies. After that, they fled Nar Shaddaa.\nLater, when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader crash-landed on Vrogas Vas, Organa approached Solo and Chewbacca for help in defeating Vader and saving Luke. While Han Solo faced off against Doctor Chelli Aphra, Chewbacca ripped the arms off of Triple-Zero, a homicidal protocol droid. But Triple-0 managed to inject a lethal dose of Mandalorian xenotox into Chewbacca, leveling the playing field. But before Triple-0 could kill Chewbacca, Luke came to the rescue, further damaging Triple-Zero. Chewbacca, Luke, Han Solo, and R2-D2 then all fled from BT-1, a homicidal astromech droid. As they all went to save Leia from Vader, they were attacked by Krrsantan, who was working alongside Aphra. Even though he was feeling the effects of Triple-Zero's poison, Chewbacca started fighting Krrsantan. Chewbacca was initially losing the fight, but when R2-D2 injected him with the antidote to the poison, Chewbacca started winning the fight. However, Krrsantan was defeated when he attacked C-3PO, who electrocuted Krrsantan. When they returned to the Falcon, they were able to capture Aphra.\nLater, Chewbacca assisted the rebellion in commandeering the Star Destroyer Harbinger. Chewbacca jettisoned the ship's reactor just before it exploded, creating the illusion that the ship was destroyed. He, along with many other Rebels, worked on keeping the ship afloat while flying it towards Tureen VII. When Task Force 99 infiltrated the Harbinger to stop them from breaking the Empire's blockade of Tureen VII, Chewbacca fought one of the elite stormtroopers, Zuke. Since the fight took place in the engine room, Chewbacca was able to throw Zuke into the engine's machinery, which brought the engine back to full power. When the Rebels broke the Imperial siege above Tureen VII, they all fled except for C-3PO, who was captured by SCAR Squadron.\nAt some point, Organa was nearly captured by the Empire while transporting important information on Skorii-Lei, but escaped with the help of an inhabitant of the planet named Pash Davane. Solo, Skywalker, and Chewbacca helped the two escape in the Millennium Falcon.\nWhen Skywalker left with Aphra for the Screaming Citadel, and Solo, Organa, and Starros were preparing to go rescue him, Chewbacca attempted to go with them, but wasn't allowed, because the people of Ktath'atn were extremely hostile towards Wookiees.\nLater, Solo was asked by Mothma to transport Grakkus to a Rebel holding facility in the catacombs of Akiva. During the trip, Solo and Chewbacca were attacked by several TIE fighters. Chewbacca manned the Millennium Falcon's turret while Solo flew, but they had to give up and land on a nearby asteroid, since the Falcon's hyperdrive was damaged. Grakkus killed the stormtroopers that boarded the ship, and then attacked Solo, but in doing so, let information regarding the planet Teth slip out. Solo electrocuted Grakkus, and they continued on to Akiva.\nAt one point, Solo and Organa were on Odona looking for a new spot for a Rebel base. They were attacked by Frax, and Organa was grazed by a blaster bolt. Chewbacca helped her into the Falcon, and they fled.\nNow full-fledged members of the Rebel Alliance, and following a dangerous run-in with bounty hunter on Ord Mantell, Chewbacca accompanied Solo to Hoth, for they had been assigned to the newly-established Echo Base, where Chewbacca would be effecting repairs on the Millennium Falcon to pay their debt to Jabba once and for all.\nWhile at Echo Base, Chewbacca was assigned to digging corridors by Organa. On one of these assignments, Chewbacca dug into a cave occupied by a wampa. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Leia and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Chewbacca clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Chewbacca ended with the wampa waking up. The wookiee ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Leia acted as a distraction. At the last minute, Chewbacca finished his job on the door, and with Organa back inside, he closed it and trapped the woken beast in the cave.\nChewbacca's repairs on the Falcon were when Solo had to venture outside during Hoth's night to rescue Skywalker. Soon afterwards, Chewbacca and Solo destroyed an Imperial probe droid, but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out assault on the planet, forcing Chewbacca, Solo, Organa and C-3PO to flee on the Millennium Falcon.\nHowever, with the Falcon's damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Imperial forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Chewbacca continued to repair the freighter until mynocks attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a space slug, forcing them to flee. The Falcon was subsequently attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer Avenger, but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to Cloud City on the gas giant Bespin, where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintance of Han's. Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.\nUpon arrival to Cloud City, the group was welcomed by Calrissian, and spent a few days until the Falcon was repaired. However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after C-3PO disappeared. Chewbacca took on the task of finding the missing protocol droid, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some Ugnaught workers, he brought the droid back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Darth Vader, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.\nSeparated from the others, Chewbacca began to partially reassemble C-3PO, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been tortured by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's carbon-freezing facilities where Solo was to be frozen in carbonite to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Chewbacca tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day. The Wookiee then relented and allowed himself to be placed in stuncuffs as Solo was marched off and frozen.\nAs Chewbacca and Organa being escorted to Vader's ship, Calrissian, who was growing increasingly dissatisfied with Vader's deal, betrayed the Sith Lord and freed the two. Chewbacca, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Boba Fett was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the Falcon to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a duel on Cloud City with the Sith Lord. Subsequently, the group made their escape back to the Alliance Fleet, where they parted ways—Organa, Skywalker and the droids remained with the fleet, whereas Chewbacca and Calrissian set out to find Fett and Jabba to rescue Solo.\nAware of Solo's location on Jabba's Palace, the team gradually infiltrated the fortress to rescue the Corellian: First, Calrissian infiltrated as a guard, then the droids as Skywalker's \"gift,\" then Leia Organa posing as the bounty hunter Boushh with Chewbacca as her quarry; she convinced Jabba with a thermal detonator, so the Hutt had Chewbacca imprisoned.\nThat night, Organa freed Solo from his encasement at the cost of her freedom, for Jabba had caught her red-handed, and whereas the princess was to remain at the Hutt's side, Solo was thrown in a cell together with Chewbacca, who gave him a passionate embrace, happy to reunite with his old friend, and told him that Skywalker would free them with the skills he had learned as a Jedi Knight.\nSkywalker did indeed arrive and requested an audience with Jabba by influencing the crime lord's major-domus Bib Fortuna. After Skywalker was pit against Jabba's rancor and defeated it, the enraged Hutt ordered the execution of Chewbacca, Solo and Skywalker by casting them into the Great Pit of Carkoon in the Dune Sea, to be devoured by the sarlacc that resided there. Brought to the pit in a skiff, Skywalker recovered his new lightsaber and freed Chewbacca and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Chewbacca, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit. While Organa assassinated Jabba himself, the group went on to slay the rest of the Hutt's thugs, before destroying the crime lord's sail barge and returning to the Rebel Fleet aboard the Falcon.\nOn the meeting to debrief the Alliance on the plan to destroy the second Death Star, Chewbacca volunteered for a mission to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor, intent on following Solo, newly-appointed General of the Alliance. Joined by Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Imperial shuttle Tydirium, with Chewbacca piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the Star Dreadnought Executor which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Wookiee to \"fly casual,\" landing only after they were granted access by Darth Vader.\nOn the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Imperial scouts, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Chewbacca, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.\nDuring their search, Chewbacca came across a dead animal on a stake, which proved irresistible bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by Ewoks. Chewbacca was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas C-3PO was treated like a deity, and the group was transported to Bright Tree Village to become part of the banquet in C-3PO's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking C-3PO had unleashed his \"magic\" by levitating him with the Force, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after C-3PO's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City, Chief Chirpa declared them all part of their tribe, with one Ewok giving Chewbacca an enthusiastic hug.\nWith the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Chewbacca accompanied the others and successfully entered the Imperial base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Imperial forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the assault against the Death Star above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Imperial troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Chewbacca to steal an AT-ST with the help of two Ewoks. Using the commandeered walker, they reached the generator's back entrance, where Solo boarded the Imperial transport to broadcast a message to the generator's personnel while posing as an Imperial officer, thereby tricking the installation's crew into opening the door.\nThanks to the success of Han Solo's ploy, the Rebel forces, Chewbacca among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian, Nien Nunb and Wedge Antilles to destroy the Death Star above. Chewbacca looked to the sky and cheered as he witnessed the final destruction of the battle station and, later that night, he celebrated at Bright Tree Village over a bonfire; Chewbacca danced in triumph along with his friends, old and new. During the celebration, Calrissian told Solo and Chewbacca that the Falcon's sensor dish had been lost during the struggle, when Shara Bey asked him about the Pathfinders' location, to reunite with her husband, Kes Dameron.\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, Chewbacca would join Han and their rebel companions in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the remnants of the Empire. The morning after, he would take part in the assault on an Imperial holdout on far side of Endor, the Rebels hitting the base hard and fast, and entering to find their computers with data that signaled the war was not over yet.\nTwenty days or so later, Chewbacca participated alongside Solo, C-3PO, Kes Dameron, Sakas and other Rebel troops on a raid on an ISB black site at the Wretch of Tayron. During the mission, he saved Sergeant Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Chewbacca also fetched C-3PO, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers. The group then became aware of the concurrent Operation: Cinder and contacted Calrissian to deploy the Alliance Fleet so as to successfully aid the besieged Naboo.\nNow agents of the New Republic, just as Wedge Antilles set out on a reconnaissance mission that took him to Akiva, Chewbacca and Solo went on their own mission to find the Empire's supply lines, during which they visited several planets, including Ord Mantell, Ando Prime, Kara-bin and finally Dasoor. However, Chewbacca was forced to remain on the Falcon, while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the hyperspace drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of Krish marauder-ships.\nHowever, as they reached Dasoor, Imra contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity—Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Chewbacca's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Chewbacca was tasked to contact the Wookiee mercenaries, among them Roshyk, Hrrgn, and Kirratha.\nWhen Han's wife Leia learned about Han Solo's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Chewbacca not to trust Imra. However, Han and Chewbacca were determined to proceed with their campaign to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Chewbacca attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewbacca and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured and locked inside the automated Imperial prison Ashmead's Lock in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the Millennium Falcon in attempt to find a way to free his friend.\nLater, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the Siniteen architect Golas Aram, who resided on a secluded compound in the planet Irudiru. Han was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley, her son Temmin Wexley, his battle droid Mister Bones, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the New Republic soldier Jom Barell. Norra and her team had been sent by Princess Leia to rescue Han. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.\nFollowing a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system SOL-GDA, Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father Brentin Lore Wexley. Following an emotional reunion, Chewbacca stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic capital of Chandrila.\nFor the next month, Han and Chewbacca organized a campaign to hunt down Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with inhibitor chips which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Chewbacca and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's island fortress. Jas also recruited more Wookiee exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.\nWhile Chewbacca, Han, and the rest of the team infiltrated Camp Sardo, Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Imperial officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Wookiee uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and his team fought off a Low-altitude Imperial transport while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Han's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk.\nAfter Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Chewbacca and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Chewbacca along with Han, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer Dominion. They managed to storm the Dominion with webweaver spiders and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before Vice Admiral Domm Korgale.\nBefore Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Princess Leia aboard the Millennium Falcon, Captain Wedge Antilles and his Phantom Squadron, and Fleet Admiral Ackbar's flagship Home One. Chewbacca and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the Dominion. They then used the Dominion's cannons to destroy the nearby Vitiator. As a result, the remaining Imperial Star Destroyer Neutralizer capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Han Solo. Solo then left on the Millennium Falcon to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.\nIn the successive months, Chewbacca took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon Commandant Dessard and several Imperial soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Wookiee slave who turned out to be Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Chewbacca personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Chewbacca then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of Mount Arayakyak.\nOnce Kashyyyk was freed from the Imperials, Chewbacca returned to his homeworld and reestablished connections with his family. He settled back into a peaceful domestic life on his homeworld but kept in touch with his old friend Han Solo, who had become the business owner of a shipping company and the manager of a series of prestigious piloting championships known as the Five Sabers. Chewbacca had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Leia Organa, who had become a leading Populist senator in the New Republic's Galactic Senate. Following the Napkin Bombing, Chewbacca sent a message via hologram to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader destroyed her political career, Chewbacca along with other former Rebel Alliance veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.\nDespite his peaceful retirement, Chewbacca decided to join him when Han Solo resumed his smuggling activities. Fortunately, the strong familial bonds and the extended lifespan of the Wookiees allowed him to spend decades away from his people.\nChewbacca and Solo continued their partnership. Chewbacca would keep an eye out for him, including one time during which Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters—Strater, Hove, and Rigger—sent to capture him on the Serendipity cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Chewbacca sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the Serendipity's door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Corellian told them to warn their possible employers  that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.\nAt some point during the 30 years after the Battle of Endor, the Millennium Falcon was stolen from Han and Chewbacca, at the age of 234, and they were using a Baleen-class heavy freighter, the Eravana, for their smuggling operations. They eventually recovered the Falcon using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet Jakku. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewbacca went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger Rey and the defecting stormtrooper Finn hiding, whom Han assumed were the thieves that had stolen the Falcon. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance as he had a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewbacca agreed to help them.\nUnfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, who had hired Solo on previous jobs, which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewbacca went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, Bala-Tik, recognizing the BB-series astromech droid from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three rathtars. Han, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the Falcon, though Chewbacca was injured from a blaster shot during the escape.\nChewbacca accompanied Han, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to meet with Maz Kanata. After the First Order was tipped off that BB-8 was with them, they attacked Maz's castle. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn were captured by the First Order. However, the Resistance had also been tipped off, and Resistance T-70 X-wing starfighters led by Poe Dameron arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs. Ren ordered the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them. Despite the First Order being driven off, Han witnessed Kylo Ren carrying Rey away. The remaining Falcon crew then rendezvoused with the Resistance at their home base. There Chewbacca's wounds were treated by Resistance doctor, Major Harter Kalonia.\nAs Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them Starkiller's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point—a thermal oscillator—that, if destroyed, would eliminate the superweapon. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its main weapon.\nHan Solo piloted the Falcon to Starkiller Base accompanied by Chewbacca and Finn. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the X-wing squadron to strike, although Finn's main objective was to rescue Rey. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the Falcon landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn snuck into the main base and captured Captain Phasma, who they forced to disable Starkiller's shields before disposing her in a garbage chute. They reunited with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Poe Dameron commenced their assault. They fired on the base's weak point, but failed to destroy it as the First Order sent TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.\nSeeing this, Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Han then confronted his son, Kylo Ren, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his lightsaber to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Han's chest. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca, Han stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Chewbacca fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Finn and Rey also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Chewbacca managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Chewbacca then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy Starkiller's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge its main weapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which would eventually result in destroying the superweapon and leveling the entire planet's terrain.\nAs Chewbacca made his exit from the base, he briefly debated upon whether to pursue and kill Kylo Ren. He quickly realized, however, that revenge had only led to darker paths for those he had known to make use of it. Thus Chewbacca quickly decided that saving those still alive was the better alternative. He quickly commandeered a snow speeder and headed back to the Millennium Falcon which was guarded by six Snowtroopers. One by one, Chewbacca took them out and entered the Falcon. The Falcon then rose from the snow and headed off to find Rey and Finn.\nShortly afterward, Chewbacca arrived with the Millennium Falcon to rescue the scavenger and Finn, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Resistance fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered hyperspace to return to D'Qar.\nThe Resistance celebrated their victory while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourned Han's death. R2-D2 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Luke Skywalker was hiding. Using this, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Rey flew aboard the Falcon to Ahch-To, where Luke was exiled.\nAfter Rey tried and failed to recruit Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca decided to help her in convincing his old friend into helping them by busting in his hut. When Luke heard of Han Solo's death, Chewbacca comforted him. Chewbacca was later seen aboard the Millennium Falcon when Luke came in to remember all the good times he had in his adventure. Later that evening, Chewbacca caught and roasted two porgs for dinner, but relented when their brethren approached him, watching sadly before scaring them away.\nDuring the Battle of Crait between the remaining forces of the Resistance and a First Order invasion army, Chewbacca piloted the Millennium Falcon, using it to lure the Order's TIE fighters away from a force of Resistance ski speeders. After the battle, he landed the ship and used it to evacuate the surviving members of the Resistance.\nDuring the Resistance's time on Anoat, Chewbacca piloted the Millennium Falcon to save Rey after she provoked an attack by an Anoatian pit beast. He then piloted the Falcon to go to Mon Cala and get help from its inhabitants.\nTraveling aboard the Millennium Falcon to the Sinta Glacier Colony, Finn and Poe Dameron engaged Chewbacca in an intense game of dejarik. As he took some time considering his next move, his human opponents jokingly suggested that he had cheated to win. The implication infuriated Chewbacca, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Their game was interrupted by an alarm from the cockpit, and Chewbacca ordered his opponents not to turn off the game as he left to check it, but Finn and Poe agreed that he was cheating and shut off the holochess board.\nThe Falcon arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony, and Finn opened the docking hatch to meet a Resistance informant, Boolio, who informed them about a spy in the First Order and gave them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to give it to General Organa. As First Order TIE fighters jumped into the system, the Resistance members downloaded the message into R2-D2 and made their escape. Poe damaged the Falcon in the escape, angering Chewbacca, and further infuriated him performing several lightspeed skips to shake off their pursuers.\nThe group returned to the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss bearing the knowledge they obtained from Boolio. They decoded the information, and Poe stated that Darth Sidious' return was confirmed, and that the Sith Eternal's fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order, was hiding on Exegol in the Unknown Regions, but without any leads to the true location of Exegol. Rey, however, had learned from Luke Skywalker's notes in the Jedi texts of a relic known as a Sith wayfinder that could lead to Exegol. Resolving to continue Luke's search, Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO departed in the Millennium Falcon to Pasaana, where the original trail went cold.\nThe Falcon exited hyperspace over the desert planet of Pasaana and landed at Luke's coordinates near the Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors. Wandering among the crowd, the group attempted to lay low and blend in. Unsurprisingly, Chewbacca struggled to slouch and keep his head low. At this time, Kylo Ren established a connection with Rey through their Force-bond and stole a necklace she had received from the Aki-Aki. Rey rushed to warn her comrades that the First Order knew their location and that they needed to find the wayfinder quickly. As they prepared to escape, a lone stormtrooper confronted them before being quickly shot by a mysterious figure. Asking the team to follow him into a transport, the masked savior revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, who had seen Chewbacca in the crowd.\nLando showed them a hologram of a Sith wayfinder and explained that only two were ever created. He further revealed that many years prior, he accompanied Luke went in search of the a Sith loyalist named Ochi, whom they believed held a key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his ship, the Bestoon Legacy, abandoned. The old hero of the Rebellion offered them directions to Ochi's ship in the desert where he left it, as squadrons of TIEs and First Order dropships flew overhead. Chewbacca and the crew hurried through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders and attracting the attention of two First Order treadspeeders, which began a fierce pursuit aided by jet troopers.\nThe troopers proved no match for the Resistance and were swiftly dispatched, though not before sending the stolen speeders crashing into the quicksands of the Lurch Canyon. Chewbacca and his comrades fell into a web of caves below the surface, quickly joining up as they used the glow of the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive flashlight to guide themselves through a series of underground tunnels. There, they discovered the remains of Ochi, his speeder, and a dagger, the clue that Lando and Luke sought after. Rey felt a very strong connection to the weapon, but couldn't quite articulate it. C-3PO identified the writing as a Sith language depicting the location of the wayfinder, but revealed that his programming restricted him from translating the script. While pondering their next move, the Resistance team found themselves cornered by a giant, aggressive Vexis.\nNoticing that the serpent was wounded, Rey approached and used the Force to heal its injuries, satiating it and providing them an exit out of the tunnels. Chewbacca took possession of the dagger, placing it in his sachel as the group headed to escape the planet in the Bestoon Legacy. Unbeknownst to Chewbacca and the crew, the Knights of Ren had arrived on Pasaana to hunt them down. Sensing Kylo Ren's presence, Rey walked out into the desert to confront him alone, but Chewbacca was captured by the Knights before he could retrieve her. The dagger was taken from him as he boarded a First Order transport. Rey and Kylo both noticed the departure of a transport, and while she used the Force to pull the ship back to the ground, Kylo counteracting her by pushing it away. In her frustration, lightning blasted from Rey's hand, destroying the transport and sending it crashing to the ground. Horrified at the thought of killing Chewbacca, Rey screamed in despair before boarding Ochi's ship with the rest of her crew.\nAs Ochi's ship hurried away from Pasaana, the Resistance team mourned the apparent loss of Chewbacca and the dagger. C-3PO remorsefully told his companions that the dagger's inscription was only committed to his memory. they plan is made to hack into C-3PO's programming to bypass the restrictions. Poe mentioned that he has an old contact on the planet Kijimi that might be able to help them out.\nAboard the Star Destroyer Steadfast, General Hux presented to Allegiant General Pryde a \"valuable prisoner\" taken during the fighting: Chewbacca, still alive and safe aboard a different transport. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Wookiee, ordered he be taken to Interrogation Six. Shortly after, Kylo Ren returned to the Steadfast, having failed to accomplish his task set by Palpatine. On Kijimi, Poe tracked down an old contact of his, Zorii Bliss, who brought them to the droidsmith Babu Frik to override C-3PO's programming to read the Sith language on the dagger, at the cost of his memories.\nDuring the process, the Knights of Ren arrived on Kijimi after following the Resistance group there. At the sight of the Steadfast in the sky, Rey sensed that Chewbacca had survived, and the group staged a rescue mission aboard the Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii. As they boarded, Rey followed the feeling that she needed the dagger, recovering it along with Chewbacca's bowcaster and bandolier. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn rescued Chewbacca, but their rescue attempt failed and resulted in their capture. Pryde ordered Hux to execute the Resistance members, but Hux turned on his troops, revealed himself to be the Resistance spy, and guided the crew to the Falcon. Before departing Kijimi, they rescued Rey from her confrontation with Kylo Ren in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay.\nThe group traveled to Kef Bir and Chewbacca stayed behind to repair the Falcon as Rey attempted to find the wayfinder aboard the wreckage of the second Death Star. While she eventually recovered the wayfinder, Kylo Ren arrived and destroyed it. In the ensuing lightsaber duel, both Kylo and Rey sensed the death of Leia, giving Rey the chance to defeat him and escape in his ship. Following Rey's departure, Chewbacca and the remainder of the Resistance crew boarded the Falcon along with their newfound ally Jannah and returned to their hidden base on Ajan Kloss. Upon returning, Chewbacca learned of Leia's death and mourned her along with the rest of the Resistance.\nRey was able to locate Exegol with the wayfinder and transmitted her coordinates to R2. The Resistance then used the coordinates to mount a full-scale assault on the Sith fleet. The Resistance was met with formidable force as the Sith Eternal forces prepared to overtake the galaxy. Overwhelmed and hopeless, Poe apologized to the Resistance and conceded that the enemy was too formidable to defeat. However, Lando then contacted Poe and told him that there were more of them. Piloting the Falcon along with Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles, Lando led a fleet of reinforcements to aid the Resistance. During the battle, Sidious severely damaged the Resistance fleet with a massive burst of Force lightning. However, with the help of their allies and the final destruction of Sidious, the Resistance was able to defeat the remaining Sith forces and save the galaxy.\nUpon returning to Ajan Kloss, the Resistance celebrated their victory. During the celebration, Maz called Chewbacca over to her and awarded the Wookiee a medal which was once worn by Han Solo.\nKnown for his great strength, bravery and loyalty, Chewbacca often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors, which made people trust him more than they did Solo. However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing. He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.\nAs a Wookiee, Chewbacca knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the Falcon; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him. Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior. Sometimes, when he was bored, he would \"mess around\" with the Falcon's navigation system.\nWhen his friend Han Solo briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Hoth, Chewbacca was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return. Later, when Solo was to be encased in carbonite in Cloud City, he tried to fight to save him despite the presence of the Sith Lord Darth Vader and an Imperial security detail.\nChewbacca's desire to free his family and people led him to take part in Han Solo's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk from Imperial rule. He came up with the idea of using webweaver spiders to storm the Star Destroyer Dominion. Chewbacca loved his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo, who had been separated from him by the Empire. He and his son experienced an emotional reunion during the liberation of Kashyyyk.\nBesides the characteristic strength of his species, Chewbacca possessed exceptional skills in piloting as well as mechanic repairs, from his experience of piloting the Millennium Falcon, of which he had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems. Chewbacca was notably faster at operating the Falcon's controls, a fact he kept hidden from Han to prevent hurting the smuggler's ego. Although not particularly meticulous, Chewbacca's technical skill allowed him to understand the inner workings of a great number of devices, including droids and transmitters, being able to build one out of a wrecked starship.\nLike many of his people, Chewbacca preferred their native bowcaster as his personal weapon. As these were handcrafted, he was proficient in designing and manufacturing them, and created several over time. The latest known bowcaster that he crafted was during the Imperial era. It was an unconventional design, as he had used the frame and power pack of a stormtrooper blaster.\nChewbacca first appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. He had a major role in both of the subsequent films of the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi, and also appeared in the prequel film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. He was portrayed in all films by Peter Mayhew, who also reprised the role for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens and its sequel, Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. Finnish basketball coach and insurance salesman Joonas Suotamo doubled as Chewbacca for some of the more physical scenes in The Force Awakens, due to Mayhew's advanced age.\n\nChewbacca was a major character in many stories of the Expanded Universe, the continuity now known as Star Wars Legends, but was killed off in the novel The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime. Chewbacca's death in this publication was marked as Number One in the 2005 article 20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe, published in the Star Wars Insider official magazine. On April 25, 2014, the Expanded Universe was declared non-canon as a whole, with the only elements considered canon being the original and prequel films, the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the film that launched it, and most material released after that date. George Lucas placed off-limits the possibility to use Chewbacca in The Clone Wars when writer Henry Gilroy was writing the show bible, though he later appeared in the third season episode \"Wookiee Hunt.\"\nGeorge Lucas came up with the concept of Chewbacca after people mistook Indiana, an Alaskan malamute dog owned by Lucas in the 1970s, as a human riding beside him in his car. There were many early versions of Chewbacca's appearance . When it was time for Ralph McQuarrie to make concept art of Chewbacca, Lucas gave him a picture of a Lemur for reference. Stuart Freeborn, the make-up artist that transformed Mayhew into Chewbacca, was given a different reference point, and he was instructed to make a creature that is a mix of a cat and a dog. Freeburn was influenced by the monkey-man creatures that he recently worked on in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Chewbacca's final appearance in the movie is based on a 1976 piece of concept art by Ralph McQuarrie, which in turn was based on an illustration by John Schoenherr for George R.R. Martin's novelette \"And Seven Times Never Kill a Man,\" published in the July 1975 issue of Analog. The Schoenherr illustration also includes a weapon that became an inspiration for Chewbacca's bowcaster.His final appearance became a mix of a dog, cat, lemur, and a monkey.\nIn the original draft of A New Hope, Chewbacca had a father named Auzituck. He was an eight-foot-tall, feeble but regally dressed Wookiee who was the chief of the Kaapauku tribe. The Auzituck anti-slaver gunship was named after Auzituck.\nFor his appearances in the original trilogy, the Chewbacca suit, designed by Stuart Freeborn, was made out of knitted mohair  and yak hair. It would later be used and retouched during the making of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace for Senator Yarua. For his appearance in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, Chewbacca was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.\nThe memorable voice of Chewbacca was designed by Ben Burtt, sound designer for all nine films. Creating Chewbacca's voice was Burtt's first job for A New Hope. He mixed together various animal growls for different emotions, including those of walruses, lions, badgers, bears, seals, sea lions, tigers, camels,, and sick animals. The most heavily used sound came from a cinnamon bear named Pooh. Burtt also used a black bear named Tarik, who died of congestive heart failure, liver disease, and cancer in October, 1994 at the age of 16.Burtt also used Petulia, a walrus that he recorded at the zoo.",
