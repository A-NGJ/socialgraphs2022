He was the only Kilassin of his kind and every year, the Tarasin Hiironi irstat would send two of their best hunters to try and hunt Tassa'to. However, they never succeeded in killing their quarry and would always return to the irstat empty handed, with cuts and bruises that Tassa'to had inflicted on them",
