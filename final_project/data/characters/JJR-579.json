 "content": "JJR-579 was a male stormtrooper in service to the Galactic Empire's Imperial Army. In 4 BBY, he was stationed on Grand Moff Tarkin's Imperial Star Destroyer, the Sovereign, based on Lothal.\nJJR-579 was a stormtrooper stationed aboard the Sovereign, the flagship of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, in 4 BBY. Stationed at the TIE Fighter Depot aboard the vessel, he was present as the Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus was being transported for his final interrogation. During these events, a TIE fighter that had been commandeered by the Spectres entered the hangar and JJR-579 commented to his companion, JTN-303, that the vessel's colorful paint job was against Imperial regulations. JTN-303 replied that he kind of liked the design, and JJR-579, a dedicated soldier of the Empire, was about to question his companion's loyalty when the TIE fighter set off a stunner, knocking the two stormtroopers out. The two have left the area by the time the rebels escaped.",
