 "content": "Maban was a male Human who was a miner at the Peragus Mining Facility. When HK-50 took control of the facility in 3951 BBY and turned the droids of Peragus on the miners they retreated to the facility's dormitories. Maban made it to the dormitory level but was separated from his coworkers due to a lockdown of the facility. Despite his efforts, he was frozen to death by an automated fire extinguisher. However, had he made it to the dormitories with the others he wouldn't have survived much longer. Poisonous gas was building up inside the locked rooms due to an explosion which had damaged the ventilation system eventually killing all inside.",
