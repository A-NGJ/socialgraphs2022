 "content": "Elan Tallah was a Galacian leader of the hill people of Gala.\nElan was the illegitimate heir of the dead King Cana of Gala and Tema of the hill people, long before Cana married Veda. Elan lived much of her life leading the hill people. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn came in search of her, trying to convince her come to Galu with her people and join the elections, in an effort to ensure that Wila Prammi, the one candidate not anti-democratic  or in league with Offworld Corporation , would be chosen. But Elan refused, convinced that Veda had sent him to imprison her or scatter the hill people.\nHowever, an attack made by misguided royalist forces under orders from Lonnag Giba, Veda's traitorous leading Council Minister, compelled her to return to the city. Once the elections were over, Elan was shown to be the true heir to the throne as she bore the Mark of the Crown, a mark only detectable in one chamber of the palace, and only seen on the true heir. She comforted her half-brother Beju afterwards.\nElan was known for her leadership and healing skills, as well as her stubborn but kind personality.",
