 "content": "Coralya was a female Human prostitute who operated out of Providence during the Galactic Civil War.\nBorn on Dantooine, Coralya chose the adventurer's life at a young age, which forged her strong nature. During the Galactic Civil War, she was chosen as a chief and representative by her colleagues at the pirate lair of Providence.\nCoralya had a strong will and sense of command, and was able to impose herself on the brutal and bawdy men of the station. She would always enforce her rights, which earned her respect but also garnered hatred by those who didn't receive her favors or challenged her.\nFew would stand before her, and her authority was undisputed in the arcades.\nCoralya was created by Jean-Michel Ringuet for the ambiguously canon roleplaying aid \"Providence,\" which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 1. She was illustrated by Jean-Marc Emy.",
