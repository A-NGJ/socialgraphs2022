 "content": "Drang, along with Sturm, was one of Talon Karrde's two pet vornskrs.\nKarrde encountered Drang pinned in one of his Myrkr base's perimeter traps. Having already learned from Sturm that removing a vornskr's venomous tail will curb its aggressive tendencies, Karrde tranquilized Drang and bobbed its tail. When Drang recovered, Karrde was able to train him easily. Karrde brought Drang and Sturm to Mount Tantiss, in hopes that they could locate Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker using their Force-related hunting technique.\nThe name, along with Drang, was a reference to Sturm und Drang, an eighteenth-century German literary movement emphasizing struggles of the individual against society, something which author Timothy Zahn felt would appeal to Karrde as an educated, pun-loving sort.",
