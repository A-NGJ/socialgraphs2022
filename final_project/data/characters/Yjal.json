 "content": "Yjal was a Rattataki male arms dealer who lived during the time of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was an associate of Kaliyo Djannis and hired her to provide him with more weapons to sell. Her side deals got him in trouble and he lost a considerable fortune and almost went to prison. Following that, he began hunting her down to either force her recoup his losses or kill her. To protect herself, Djannis made Yjal a target for Imperial Intelligence and had Cipher Nine assassinate him.\nIf the agent player chooses a light side option, he/she can avoid violence by paying Kaliyo's debt.",
