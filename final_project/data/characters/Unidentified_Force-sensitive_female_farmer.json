 "content": "This farmer was a girl who had Force potential but was ultimately unworthy of becoming a Jedi Knight and was sentenced to work on Dantooine. She was encouraged by her friend Wass to fight against the Separatist droids when they attacked the planet. Though she had difficulty using telekinesis and at first was overcome by fear, she noticed she was unconsciously lifting metal tools, and grabbing a metal pole, fought against a small force of B1 Battle Droids, deflecting a burst of blaster fire and defeating several before a shot disarmed her. Managing to draw on her telekinesis again, she was able to push and take down the remaining four, dropping to her knees from the effort.\nFinding her friends had defeated the other droids, all three took a ship to Coruscant, hoping to rejoin the Jedi academy and graduate.",
