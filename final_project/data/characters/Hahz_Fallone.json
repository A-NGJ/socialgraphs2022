 "content": "Hahz Fallone was a minor crime lord who operated out of Iritsa on the planet Chazwa. He was a rival to Jorga Sune, who felt that Hahz had betrayed him on an earlier raid on the planet Eckless. This raid also caused him to be a wanted man on Eckless and he was hunted down after ten years by Rusha. He used a group of bounty hunters to set up Sune with a fake artifact that led to his death.\nHe wore the real Black Sphere on a gold chain around his neck.",
