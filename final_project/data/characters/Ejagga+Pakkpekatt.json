 "content": "Ejagga Pakkpekatt was a Hortek officer in New Republic Intelligence.\nPakkpekatt began his career as an officer in the Interrogation Department of Alliance Intelligence. There, he was assigned to the Alliance's most stubborn Imperial prisoners, where he used his Hortek telepathic abilities and intimidation skills to access information beyond standard interrogators.\nAfter the formation of the New Republic, he was transferred to the Special Threats Division of New Republic Intelligence. A stern officer, Pakkpekatt was unpopular amongst some members of the Council on Security and Intelligence .\nBecause of his hunting instincts and impressive track record, Colonel Pakkpekatt was placed in command in 16 ABY of the expedition charged with intercepting the Teljkon Vagabond. Immediately, Pakkpekatt was at odds with General Lando Calrissian, dispatched by Admiral Hiram Drayson under the guise of representing the Defense Fleet. After Calrissian and his crew boarded the Vagabond against Pakkpekatt's orders, the colonel attempted to give chase when it vanished at Gmar Askilon. When the CSI recalled most of his task force for duty in the Koornacht Cluster, Pakkpekatt took a volunteer crew aboard Lady Luck to rescue Calrissian, Lobot, C-3PO and R2-D2. Pakkpekatt and his crew found the Vagabond through a slave circuit, and they were pulled through a series of hyperspace jumps until arriving at Brath Qella, where the mystery of the Vagabond was made clear.",
