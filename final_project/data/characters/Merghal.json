 "content": "Merghal was a male Cathar criminal living during the Galactic War. As some point after the Eternal Empire conquest, he was arrested by the Galactic Republic and forcibly conscripted as a Private into the Dead Man's Legion, a unit of the Republic Army for men convicted of crime. In 3631 BBY Dead Man's Legion was deployed on Nar Shaddaa under Provost Marshal Fideltin Rusk. Merghal tried to act tough in Rusk's presence, but was forced to back down after Rusk threatened him with a firing squad.\nMerghal appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during the Rusk Alliance alert mission.",
