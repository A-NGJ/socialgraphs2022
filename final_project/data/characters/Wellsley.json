 "content": "Wellsley was a Twi'lek male with teal skin. At some point between 22 and 19 BBY, Wellsley attended Tomarian's Annual Festival of Light Gala at Tomarian's theater on the planet Naboo with the Togruta Rawlson.\nWhile attending the gala, Wellsley was clothed in a tan dress shirt covered with a dark blue vest fastened with a wide green sash. Golden bands adorned his lekku. Upon arrival at the gala, Wellsley and Rawlson were greeted by the gala's host, Tomarian. Wellsley expressed that the pair would never miss one of Tomarian's parties and was excited to see that a Jedi—Anakin Skywalker—was present.\nWellsley appeared in \"The Incident, Part 1,\" a comic story by Katie Cook with illustrations by Cara McGee and Brittany Peer. The story was published on June 23, 2021 by IDW Publishing in the fifth issue of the 2020 comic series Star Wars Adventures.",
