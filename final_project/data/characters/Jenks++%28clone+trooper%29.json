 "content": "\"Jenks\" was the nickname of a clone trooper commander during the Clone Wars. He was aboard a Republic gunship with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, when it crashed on a mission to locate General Grievous and Count Dooku's hideout on the planet Ruhe.\nWhen Jenks told the Jedi that the repairs to the ship may take days, Obi-Wan and Anakin took two clones and went out to find Dooku's fortress on speeder bikes, leaving Jenks behind to make repairs. The Jedi were soon ambushed by battle droids, who destroyed their bikes and killed the two clones. Continuing to the hideout on foot, the Jedi arrived to find themselves surrounded by battle droids. Fighting their way to the roof, they were forced to the edge, which caused Obi-Wan to fall off, only to be caught by Jenks and the repaired gunship.",
