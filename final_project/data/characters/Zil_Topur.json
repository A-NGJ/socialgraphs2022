 "content": "Zil Topur was a Quarren with orange skin and blue eyes. In 22 BBY, Topur wore a crimson robe while attending a session of the Galactic Senate in the Senate Building on the planet Coruscant where Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks proposed that Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine be given emergency executive powers to raise a Grand Army of the Republic to combat the Separatist Crisis. Topur was stood in a repulsorpod with Senator Tundra Dowmeia and another Quarren, and the trio applauded Binks's suggestion, which was soon implemented as the Clone Wars began.\nZil Topur appeared in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which was released on May 16, 2002. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was identified by the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used prior to the release of Attack of the Clones in the StarWars.com Databank entry for the Quarren. The name was first associated with the Quarren seen in the film by the Depth Commentary on StarWars.com that was accessible through the DVD-ROM home release of Attack of the Clones on November 12, 2002.",
