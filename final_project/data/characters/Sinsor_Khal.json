 "content": "Sinsor Khal was a male Hapan who was once a Jedi trainee during the time of the Galactic Republic. For reasons unknown, he was considered a failure as a Jedi, and as such was overlooked during the Great Jedi Purge. Shortly before the Purge, he returned home to the Hapes Consortium and eventually became a respected scientist, but his disregard for the well-being of his subjects resulted in a semi-imprisonment on Gallinore by Ta'a Chume.\nIn an effort to isolate Yuuzhan Vong communication technology and use it to her advantage, Jaina Solo sought out Khal during the Yuuzhan Vong War. To achieve results, a captured pirate named Crimpler, who had a coral implant in his neck, was \"experimented\" on into a near-death state. After two days, Khal got the desired results, and gave them to Jaina to use.",
