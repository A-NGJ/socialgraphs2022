 "content": "Royd Pew was a male Human scientist who worked in the Tech Section of Imperial Intelligence. He was in charge of creating and modifying technology for field agents.\nJahan Cross visited him before his trip to the Corporate Sector to arm himself. While there, he and Pew observed Bleeker test out a set of parawings. Even though the test was unsuccessful, Cross still decided to take a set with him. Pew expressed disbelief at this decision, but then went with Cross to look at weapons for his trip.\nRoyd Pew was a short, balding man with thick spectacles that hid his eyes. He exhibited Speciesism by expressing his disdain for Alessi Quon.",
