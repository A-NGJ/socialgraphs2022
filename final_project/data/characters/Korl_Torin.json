 "content": "Korl Torin was a Human male who served the Sith Empire during the Galactic War. He was posted on Hoth, spreading anti-Republic propaganda.\nIn 3642 BBY, after torturing Aldogh for information, Torin planned on leading a siege towards Crescent Canyon Mine and diverting the highly volatile gas under the Republic's Aurek Base. However, the Republic discovered his plan and dispatched a talented strike team to stop him. Torin boasted that he had already won and demanded that the strike team surrender, promising to ensure they could be returned to Republic space. He was proven wrong when reinforcements arrived in the form of Republic troopers, Talz and Ortolans. Korl was killed in the ensuring battle.",
