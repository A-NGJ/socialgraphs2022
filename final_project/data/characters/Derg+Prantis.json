 "content": "Derg Prantis was a male Twi'lek biologist who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nDerg Prantis was a biologist serving as chief scientist of the Mos Eisley Biolab, based in Mos Eisley, on the planet Tatooine. One of his employees was the female Aqualish lab assistant Bera Jeza.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Derg Prantis obtained a sample of the dreadful Blackwing virus from an Imperial scientist. The Empire had secretly recruited a group of scientists on the planet Dathomir to turn the virus into a bioweapon. Prantis therefore built a secret laboratory on the remote planet Lok to conduct his own research on the virus in order to create a super soldier drug. The scientist recruited his lab assistant Bera Jeza to help him the project. However, Jeza soon betrayed her employer and contacted the Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure to sell him the super soldier drug. Having discovered the betrayal, Derg Prantis requested his long time associate Cale Herron to help him evacuate his secret lab and destroy evidence. However, the lab was brutally attacked before Herron could intervene and the entire staff was assassinated. Prantis eventually returned to the Mos Eisley Biolab on Tatooine.\nIn 1 ABY, the laboratory in Mos Eisley was attacked and Prantis was assassinated. In the meanwhile, Bera Jeza was murdered in a street of Mos Eisley. As Jeza had ties with Jabba the Hutt, his majordomo Bib Fortuna hired a spacer to investigate the crime. The spacer discovered Prantis's corpse in the laboratory along with a data disk. The disk contained Derg Prantis's last words, with instructions to contact Cale Herron in Mos Taike. With the help of Herron, the spacer investigated Derg Prantis's secret lab on Lok. The investigation finally led to the discovery of a Blackwing outbreak on Dathomir.\nDerg Prantis appeared as a dead non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Derg Prantis was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13,\" released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong,\" an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.",
