 "content": "Vasp Vaspar was a human male politician who represented the Taldot sector in the Imperial Senate. He was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served as the Minister of Industry in the Alliance Cabinet, part of the Alliance Civil Government. Though he was risk averse, he was not opposed to armed conflictâ€”but he did not believe the Alliance was capable of destroying the Empire's planet-killing Death Star.\nVasp Vaspar was a politician who represented the Taldot sector in the Imperial Senate during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He was known to oppose Emperor Palpatine's harshest policies. By 3 BBY, Vaspar was a regular attendee of banquets hosted on Alderaan by Bail and Breha Organa, the viceroy and queen of the planet, which secretly served as planning meetings for rebellion against the Empire.\nWhile continuing to serve in the Imperial government, he was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served in its Civil Government as the Minister of Industry. This made him part of the Alliance Cabinet under the leadership of its Chief of State, Chancellor Mon Mothma. As part of his role, he attended classified Alliance Cabinet meetings concerning topics such as the Death Star and Operation Fracture.\nAs Minister of Industry, Vaspar was charged with overseeing the vital yet limited resources of the fledgling Rebel Alliance. As a result of his role, he was more risk-averse than some of his fellow Alliance Cabinet members, though he was not opposed to open conflict with the Empire when warranted. However, when the Alliance learned of the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets, he did not believe that the Alliance could be successful in an attack against the battle station.\nUpon the dissolution of the Imperial Senate, he, along with fellow former Senators Nower Jebel and Tynnra Pamlo, fled to an Alliance safe world.\nVasp Vaspar was a human male with black hair, brown eyes, and light skin. The red lining on his garb denoted the Battle of Balamak.\nVaspar expressed deep concerns about the safety of Yavin 4 due to the wildlife there, and was noted to have repeatedly asked for a personal force field. Mon Mothma tried her best to assuage his worries, but told her aide to have discretion on when to say \"no\" to his requests for an audience, which weren't always as important as Vaspar claimed.\nVasp Vaspar was a character created for the 2016 anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. In the film, he is played by Swedish-Lebanese actor Fares Fares. The character's repetitive first name was inspired by similar redundancy in the actor's name.",
