 "content": "Entha Kandela was the Zabrak female scout who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nEntha Kandela was a skilled scout who served as animal control officer for the city of Mos Eisley, under the orders of Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt. She was severely under-funded by the time of the Battle of Yavin. Because of this, the vermin outside the city walls became a major health hazard. In 1 ABY, she managed to get an individual to deal with the problem. While affiliated with Jabba the Hutt's criminal organizarion, the spacer acted on behalf of the Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt. The spacer eliminated a number of womp rats, kreetles, worrts, tempest rills and rockmites for 2,150 credits, making Kandela very satisfied.\nEntha Kandela was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Entha Kandela was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. She used to be a specialized trainer providing quests to the beginner players who had chosen a \"scout\" career. The \"scout\" profession was later removed from the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005, and Entha Kandela's quests were widely revamped to be available for every new players.",
