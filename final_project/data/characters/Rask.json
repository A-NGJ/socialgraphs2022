 "content": "Rask was a Human male and native of the planet Onderon who worked as a street preacher and philosopher in the Onderonian capital city of Iziz in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. Rask was a member of the Naddist cult, which worshiped the late Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd, who once ruled Onderon. After the fall of Onderon's Naddist monarchy, Rask and his son, Nebo, continued to preach pro-Naddist sermons in the streets of Iziz.\nOne day in 3997 BBY, Rask and Nebo were delivering their usual Naddist messages when they were accosted by an angry rock-wielding mob; however, they were saved by a Jedi Knight, Exar Kun, who defended their right to free speech. Although Rask and Nebo were skeptical about Kun's assistance, Kun eventually admitted that he wanted to learn more about the dark side of the Force and believed the father-and-son duo could help him. Kun enlisted Rask and Nebo to guide him to the Tomb of Freedon Nadd on the moon Dxun, where they watched as Kun cut a hole in the side of the tomb with his lightsaber. Declaring him a tomb desecrator, Rask and Nebo pulled blasters on the Jedi when he emerged from the tomb, but Kun swiftly killed them both.\nA Human male native of the Inner Rim planet Onderon, Rask was a street preacher and philosopher in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. Rask was a member of the Naddist cult, which worshiped former Jedi and deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd, who ruled Onderon with the dark side centuries before Rask's lifetime. Rask eventually had a son, Nebo, who joined him in preaching the Naddist rhetoric to the people of Onderon's capital city of Iziz. However, their messages were very unpopular with the general public, who were happy that the Naddist monarchy fell in 3998 BBY. During their sermons, the father-and-son duo espoused the virtues of Naddist rule and denounced the Jedi Knights, whom they blamed for the downfall of the dark-side-following Onderonian government. Although Rask and his son's views were despised by their target audience, the Jedi refused to arrest them, as they had not committed any crimes.\nOne day in 3997 BBY, Rask and Nebo took to the streets to deliver their usual Naddist sermon. The two preached from the base of a statue in an Iziz courtyard and attracted a large, angry mob of people who had grown tired of their propaganda. The crowd began hurling rocks and other projectiles at the duo. However, a lone Jedi Knight named Exar Kun stepped out of the crowd and stopped the mob from their attack, defending Rask and Nebo's right to free speech. Although the father and son were skeptical at a Jedi Knight interceding on their behalf, Kun clarified that he believed that the two Naddists could help him. Kun revealed his desire to learn the secrets of the dark side of the Force, and after promising them gold, he enlisted Rask and Nebo in guiding him to the Tomb of Freedon Nadd.\nThe three flew a shuttle to the moon Dxun, where the tomb was located, finally reaching the Sith Lord's mausoleum. Kun proceeded to the tomb alone, assuring that Rask and Nebo would get a hefty reward if he found what he sought within. The two watched as Kun cut a hole in the side of the tomb with his lightsaber, and when Kun returned, Rask and Nebo pulled blasters on the Jedi Knight. Calling Kun a tomb desecrator, the two Naddists demanded that he hand over the Sith scrolls he had gathered while in the tomb; enraged, Kun killed the father and son with his lightsaber.\nRask was devoted to the Naddist cause, to the extent that he continued to ardently and vocally support the concept of a Naddist regime even after the fall of the dark-side monarchy. He was a bold public speaker, unafraid to talk about unpopular subjects in front of a crowd. Rask admired former Onderonian monarchs King Ommin and Queen Amanoa, and praised Freedon Nadd for bringing the people of Iziz protection against the wild beasts of Onderon's wilderness. Both Rask and his son despised the Jedi Knights, and were accordingly surprised and skeptical when Exar Kun protected them from a rock-wielding mob. As Naddists, both Rask and Nebo held a measure of reverence toward Nadd's tomb and were quick to accost Kun with blasters when the Jedi Knight, in their eyes, desecrated it.\nRask made his first appearance in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith, a story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and Kevin J. Anderson and released over late 1994 and early 1995. Rask appeared in the arc's second issue, wherein he is killed, and was indirectly mentioned in the arc's third issue. In his appearance, Rask was illustrated by Chris Gossett. He was also featured in the audio adaptation of Dark Lords of the Sith.",
