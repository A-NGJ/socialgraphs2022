 "content": "Duenna Derida was the mother of Terra, Guerra, and Paxxi. After Terra had been memory-wiped, the girl had turned dark. She had forgotten completely who she was. Working for the Syndicat ensured Duenna residence at Syndicat headquarters, where she remained to watch over Terra. When Terra died, Duenna knew that Terra had finally remembered who she used to be. Although Duenna worked for the Syndicat, she secretly funneled funds to those who opposed it.\nIn 44 BBY, she aided Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn on their mission to help destroy the Syndicat. She helped them break in to the headquarters one evening, overall kept them informed, and, after Kenobi was captured, she brought them news of his fate.",
