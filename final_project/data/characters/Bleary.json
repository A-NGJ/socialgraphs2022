 "content": "Bleary was a human male pirate who worked in a crew led by Maliss and Sorath, hired to collect components stolen from Project Stardust for Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit. The mobile way station the pirates operated from was attacked by the Grysks, who captured the survivors, including Bleary. The prisoners were rescued by Grand Admiral Thrawn and Commodore Karyn Faro of the Seventh Fleet, who questioned Bleary before sending him and the other pirates to be prosecuted.",
