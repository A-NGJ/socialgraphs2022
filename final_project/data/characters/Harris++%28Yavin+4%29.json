 "content": "Harris  was a female Human member of the Imperial Reclamation Service of the Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. In 3631 BBY Harris and Doctor Narissa Delau were part of Lieutenant Talos Drellik's expedition on Yavin 4. Drellik eventually left to join the Anti-Zakuul Alliance, but remained in contact with the team. The team managed to uncover a set of Sith relics dated to the era of Exar Kun: a medallion, a coffer and a set of tablets. When Harris tried to sleep while wearing the medallion, the nightmares came almost instantly. Harris eventually uncovered a new artifact in the Architect's Hollow, but when she brought the medallion and one of the tablets to it, a hulking Massassi attacked the team, killing Harris and the escort and scattering the rest.\nHarris appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during Talos Drellik's Alliance Alert mission.",
