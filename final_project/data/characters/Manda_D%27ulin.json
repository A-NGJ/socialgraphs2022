 "content": "Manda D'ulin was the leader of the group of six Mistryl Shadow Guard warrior-women.\nShe was contacted in 0 BBY by a scientist named Kellering, who claimed that he was looking for additional security to protect the Hammertong project on behalf of Dr. Eloy.\nHowever, when she traveled with Kellering to the base to meet Eloy, she was attacked and gunned down by Imperial troops, followed soon after by her comrade Pav D'armon. In reprisal, the rest of the Mistryl team attacked the base, and stole the Strike Cruiser carrying the Hammertong prototype.",
