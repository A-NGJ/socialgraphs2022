 "content": "Pedric Tosh was a light-skinned Human male who served as a Palace Guard sergeant for the planet Naboo's eponymous Royal Naboo Security Forces. During Tosh's service, he carried a S-5 heavy blaster pistol, and wore the typical Palace Guard uniform.\nPedric Tosh was first pictured in a promotional image for 2002's Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, though it is difficult to tell if the character appears in the film itself. The character's name was revealed in the \"Rogues Gallery\" feature of Star Wars Insider 145, released in 2013. Tim Veekhoven, Kevin Beentjes, and Sander de Lange, who contributed to the article, envisioned him as the uncle of Jann Tosh, a character from the TV series Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO. Further speculation was made from the authors about Tosh being one of the Palace Guards killed in the explosion of Senator Padm√© Amidala's J-type diplomatic barge. Because it is unclear if the extra portraying Pedric Tosh is visible at all in Attack of the Clones, this article makes no assumption about the exact time of the Palace Guard's service.",
