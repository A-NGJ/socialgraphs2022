 "content": "A Trandoshan male guard protected a village, and was the commander of a group of several other guards. When the village was attacked by bandits who followed Kouru, the guards stepped in to defend the villagers after being signaled by the chief. The Sith emerged from her troop transport, and the Trandoshan commander ordered her to surrender. The bandit leader leapt down at the Trandoshan, who ordered the other guards to run before the Sith pulled him toward her using the Force. As the Trandoshan once again told the guards to run, knowing they could not beat her, the Sith stabbed him with her lightsaber parasol, killing him.\nThe Trandoshan first appeared in \"The Duel,\" a short film in the Star Wars: Visions series directed by Takanobu Mizuno, produced by Kamikaze Douga, and released on Disney+ on September 22, 2021. He was voiced by Chado Horii in the original Japanese and by JP Karliak in the English dub.",
