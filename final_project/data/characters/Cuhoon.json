 "content": "Cuhoon was a male Fluggrian youngling who was in Tabor Hospital on Protobranch. He was unable to walk, and had to lie on a diagnostic hovercot. When Protobranch was hit by a solar storm that sent its floating cities crashing to the ground, Cuhoon and several other younglings were rescued by Doctor Pira, with the help of the Jedi Padawans Dooku and Sifo-Dyas.\nCuhoon first appeared in the audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott and published in 2019. The spelling of Cuhoon's name was given in the script of the audiobook.",
