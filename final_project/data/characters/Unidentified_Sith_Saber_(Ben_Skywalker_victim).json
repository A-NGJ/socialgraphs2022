 "content": "A Human male Sith Saber was part of the Lost Tribe of Sith on the remote planet Kesh. In 44 ABY, the Human served in a mission to capture the dark side being Abeloth on the planet Nam Chorios. During the mission, he and three other Sith Sabers ambushed Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, and former Sith apprentice Vestara Khai in the town Kesla Vein. During the fight, the Saber was killed by Ben Skywalker.\nA Human male served in the Lost Tribe of Sith after the Second Galactic Civil War. Born on the isolated planet Kesh, he was taken and trained by the Lost Tribe, descendants of a group of Sith who had been stranded on the world thousands of years before. In 44 ABY, the Human had reached the rank of Sith Saber and was part of a fleet sent to the planet Nam Chorios to capture the dark side entity Abeloth.\nDuring that mission, he served under fellow Sith Saber Tola Annax. Together with two other Sith Sabers and Annax, the Human ambushed in the town of Kesla Vein the exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker; his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker; and fugitive Sith apprentice Vestara Khai, who were also searching for Abeloth. The Human proceeded to duel Ben Skywalker during the ensuing fight but was beheaded by his Jedi opponent after a short time.\nThe Human was able to reach the rank of Sith Saber and was in good physical condition by 44 ABY. During the mission to Nam Chorios, he wore clothes typical for a settler on the planet. In combat, he used a red-bladed lightsaber but proved to be no match for Ben Skywalker, who defeated him after a short duel.\nThe Sith Saber appeared as a minor character in Aaron Allston's Conviction , the seventh novel of the Fate of the Jedi series.",
