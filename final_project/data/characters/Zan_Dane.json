 "content": "Zan Dane was a male Human pirate based out of Point Nadir. His background was a mystery, but he was well-versed in naval command. His accent was reminiscent of the Tapani sector.\nHe was flamboyant and enjoyed the life of a pirate, but he was not bloodthirsty. He was honorable and mischievous. Dane preferred brightly colored red and blue clothes, and wore a finely tailored silk cloak and vibrorapier.\nHe had a crew of more than 400 people and droids. His fleet consisted of two capital ships, six transports and a handful of starfighters. The two capital ships were the Amber Star, a CR90 corvette, and the Sweet Victory, a Marauder-class corvette.",
