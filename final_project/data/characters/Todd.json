 "content": "Todd was a Human male who roleplayed as a Jedi. He was once present during a battle between several individuals, including Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, among others, confusing those present. Todd claimed to have the power to control all combatants.\nTodd was a Human male who once made his presence known in the midst of an all-out battle between several individuals, including the fugitive Jedi Zayne Carrick; the Arkanian Offshoot Jarael; the leader of the Mandalorians, Mandalore the Ultimate; and Mandalore's lackey, the Lord of Pain Darth Sion. The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the Snivvian con man Marn Hierogryph, and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks were also present in the battle, although Vader and Skywalker were busy dueling each other and thus did not participate in the primary fight. Upon his emergence, Todd witnessed a fight between Carrick and Mandalore. Surprised by Todd's appearance, Carrick demanded to know his identity. In response to Carrick's question, Todd introduced himself, stating that he was roleplaying as a Jedi, and claimed that all combatants present there were his unwitting pawns. As the battle continued, Binks began to feel confused.\nLight-skinned with light-brown hair and brown eyes, Todd was dressed in garb reminiscent of traditional brown Jedi robes. However, he wore a shirt under the robe with a picture of an individual of Yoda's species. Todd also possessed a blue-bladed lightsaber and claimed to have the ability to control eight people, including two Jedi and two Sith.\nTodd's only appearance is in a short non-canon ad produced in 2008 by Wizards of the Coast to advertise the Star Wars Miniatures set Knights of the Old Republic. The ad was drawn by Jan Duursema.",
