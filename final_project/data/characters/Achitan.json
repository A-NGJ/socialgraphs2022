 "content": "Achitan was a female Togruta who lived on Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She led a group of alien refugees who reclaimed the Poh family estate on Taris, which in actuality had belonged to her family before Humans ever arrived on Taris. She presented the documents to the traveling hero sent by Relus Poh and Jaymizu Poh to clear out the estate, and the hero returned with the documents to the Pohs to prove that Achitan and her group had a more legitimate claim. The Pohs acknowledged her claim, and accepted the fact that Achitan owned the land.",
