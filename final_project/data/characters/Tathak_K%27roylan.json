 "content": "Tathak K'roylan was a male Bothan covered in black fur with tan patches, one directly over his eyes. He was the deputy intelligence leader for Bothawui. He received information from a disguised Lumiya in 40 ABY with details pertaining to the deaths of several Bothan operatives on Coruscant. He was later part of the Bothan assault fleet sent to Corellia to break the blockade. He also received the Galactic Alliance ship Shamunaar after Matric Klauskin had killed the entire crew.",
