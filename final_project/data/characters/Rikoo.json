 "content": "Rikoo was a young Force-sensitive Wookiee male who was just beginning his training as a Jedi youngling by the time of the First Battle of Geonosis. Before leaving Geonosis to go to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Rikoo asked to play hide-and-seek with a Jedi that was deployed there. After the Jedi agreed, Rikoo hid behind a crashed Republic Gunship in Petranaki Arena, but was found quickly. To try to make finding him more difficult, Rikoo hid on an outside platform. Surprised at how easily the Jedi found him yet again, Rikoo quit the game of hide-and-seek and headed off to Coruscant.\nRikoo first appeared in the mission \"Youngling Rikoo\" in the Twilight of the Republic Play Set in the 2015 video game Disney Infinity 3.0. Upon completing the mission, players receive Youngling Rikoo as a Toy Box Townsperson.",
