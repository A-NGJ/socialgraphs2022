 "content": "Capin Harinar was a male human who served as a major and a materials analyst in the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service division of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the period leading up to the Battle of Yavin.\nA male human, Capin Harinar joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire, and served as a major under General Davits Draven in Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service. A materials analyst, Major Harinar helped plan countermeasures against the Empire by examining captured Imperial technology to assess the enemy's capabilities. He was tasked by Airen Cracken to come up with possible configuration for a kyber crystal powered superweapon. He and his team determined that the Empire might try to scale up the Operation: Cinder weapon by using Project Celestial Power technology.\nA light-skinned human male with dark eyes, Major Capin Harinar had a full, bushy beard of dark hair that turned white with advanced age. In the Alliance, Harinar wore a plain tan shirt under a white overcoat, similar to the tactician's overcoat worn as an Alderaanian custom by General Jan Dodonna. As a materials analyst, Harinar spent his time examining Imperial technology to assess the Empire's capabilities and plan countermeasures with members of Alliance High Command. Airen Cracken told Mon Mothma that Harinar was very adept at reverse-engineering captured Imperial technology.",
