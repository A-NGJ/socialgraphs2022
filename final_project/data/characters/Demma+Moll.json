 "content": "Demma Moll was a woman in her mid-forties during the early years of the Galactic Empire and the leader of a resistance cell on her homeworld, Annoo. She was the mother of Kea Moll.\nDemma and Kea lived on the family farm on Annoo, which led to trouble with the gangster Sise Fromm, who wanted to take possession of the property. Demma was opposed to the tyranny of the crime gangs and the Empire and felt that evil had to be fought.\nWhen she discovered that the Fromm Gang were constructing a powerful weapons satellite, Trigon One, which they intended to use to take over the other gangs, Demma charged Kea with finding and destroying Trigon One. With the assistance of the speeder racers, Thall Joben and Jord Dusat, along with their droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, Kea succeeded in breaking into Tig Fromm's secret base on Ingo and stealing Trigon One.\nWhile Joben hid the weapons satellite in a forest on Ingo, the Fromm Gang kidnapped Demma and Dusat from the farm. Joben agreed to reveal the location in exchange for their release. Tig Fromm went to retrieve Trigon One, but Joben and R2-D2 had sabotaged the guidance system, causing the ship to collide with and destroy Sise Fromm's base on Annoo.\nDemma Moll was voiced by Toby Tarnow.",
