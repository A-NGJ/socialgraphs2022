 "content": "Condren Foreck was a wealthy farmer's daughter on the agriworld of Azbrian, one of the potential brides considered by Lando Calrissian.\nIndependently wealthy in addition to her trust funds, Condren was also an accomplished athlete. She spoke in an unusual high-pitched, squeaky voice. Though flattered by Lando's proposal, she assumed he would never actually show up. She had forgotten the offer, and by the time Lando arrived on Azbrian, she had just returned from a week-long honeymoon with her new husband Frang Colgter. The unfortunate chain of events led Lando, in his subsequent nuptial visits, to call first rather than arrive unannounced.",
