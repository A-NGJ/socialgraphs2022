 "content": "A male human native to the Core Worlds planet Brentaal IV was the father of a single daughter. He worked as a bodyguard for House Cormond on his homeworld, but left their service after he accepted a lucrative offer to oversee security for House Elegin of the planet Asmeru. The man moved with his entire family to Asmeru, and once his daughter took up the name Q'anah, the word for an ancient local festival in the planet's native tongue. The former bodyguard taught his daughter how to fight, and seeking adventure she became the mistress of the youngest son of House Elegin. She later joined a pirate crew the young noble secretly lead, taking over control of the group after her lover was captured and executed.\nQ'anah's father was first mentioned in the James Luceno novel Tarkin, released in 2014.",
