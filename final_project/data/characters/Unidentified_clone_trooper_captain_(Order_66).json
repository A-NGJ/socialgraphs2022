 "content": "A clone trooper captain served under the Jedi Masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel in 19 BBY during the waning days of the Clone Wars.\nAfter serving in the siege of the Outer Rim world Saleucami during the Clone Wars that same year, the captain, along with the Jedi Generals, were ambushed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This forced them to flee to the Bogden system—eventually taking them to the world of Bogden 3—in their damaged Theta-class T-2c shuttle. Once the group safely arrived at Bogden, the clone captain and his troopers made a stop to repair the ship before taking a lunch break.\nDuring this, the clone captain received Order 66—which deemed all Jedi as traitors—from Palpatine, Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. As instructed, the clone captain opened fire, along with the rest of his troopers, on the Jedi surrounding them, which included the younglings of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan. The clone captain was subsequently killed by K'Kruhk in retaliation.",
