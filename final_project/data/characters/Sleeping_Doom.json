 "content": "Sleeping Doom was a male Esh-kha who was imprisoned on the planet Belsavis by the Infinite Empire thousands of years before the Cold War. He resided within the Deep Prison when he along with his kind were accidentally freed by the attack of the Sith Empire on the Tomb. This led to the Esh-kha attacking both the forces of the Sith and the Galactic Republic. During the Battle of Belsavis Sleeping Doom resided within the area known as the Passage to the Scar, where he was cornered and killed.",
