 "content": "Voyce Evlen was a Human female whose mother was Admiral Biana Drayce. In 44 ABY she became captain of the Galactic Alliance corvette Starhook. She was sent by corrupt Alliance General Stavin Thaal to meet with the Imperial vessel Concussor, which, by then, was commandeered by Bhindi Drayson's unit of Wraith Squadron. Evlen spoke with the fictitious Captain Avven Hocroft, in fact Wraith Two Turman Durra in disguise, who had sent out previously a message to Thaal over the question of whether or not he wanted power. Evlen saw through Wraith Squadron's ploy and ordered fire on them. Wraiths successfully escaped.",
