 "content": "Herron was a Human male who served as a sergeant in the Republic Army during the Battle of Corellia against the Sith Empire in 3640 BBY. While stationed in the Blastfield Shipyards on Corellia, Sergeant Herron led a squad in an attempt to recover several newly-developed shuttles from the Rendili Vehicle Corporation's facility when Imperial forces seized control of the factory, but the mission was a failure because of bad intelligence on the size of the enemy forces. Herron sought aid from other Republic and Jedi forces, who were able to infiltrate the factory and open an access tunnel so that Herron and his subordinate Yung could lead their unit into the facility and steal the shuttles.",
