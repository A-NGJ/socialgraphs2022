 "content": "A Human male was a captain in the Confederate Navy.\nThe captain was the commanding officer of the battleship Starcrusher when Admiral Kirst was away. During the attempt to kill several prominent Jedi, he picked up the skeleton crew, including the Admiral, from the Starcrusher decoy.\nHe attempted to stop the internal attack by Anakin Skywalker in his interceptor, but failed and was killed with the rest of the crew when their escape pods were captured by a star's gravity well and crashed into it.",
