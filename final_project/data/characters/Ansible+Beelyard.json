 "content": "Ansible Beelyard was a Human male who was a well-known hero of the Rebel Alliance during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Known as the Holy Terror, Beelyard was the right-hand man of the famous Cody Sunn-Childe in ferocious fights against the Galactic Empire that earned them notoriety across the galaxy. However, around 3 BBY, Beelyard, Sunn-Childe and the rest of their resistance band disappeared mysteriouslyâ€”having had a religious revelation after a battle that awoke latent psychic abilities, Sunn-Childe created a dream utopia free of war, and there adopted a peaceful way of life for a time along with Beelyard and their companions.\nBeelyard and Sunn-Childe's whereabouts were unknown until 3 ABY, when Rebels Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca arrived in Sunn-Childe's pocket dimension by accident due to a hyperdrive malfunction. Their presence attracted the attention of a nearby group of Imperial troops, who began attacking Sunn-Childe's City of Dreams. Rather than forsake their pacifistic philosophy and fight back, Beelyard and his companions allowed the Imperials to destroy Sunn-Childe's realm and kill them.\nAnsible Beelyard first appeared in Star Wars  46, written by John Marc DeMatteis and released in 1981. In the issue, Beelyard was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
