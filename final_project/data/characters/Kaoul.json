 "content": "Kaoul was a male human who served in the Galactic Empire. Around two months after the establishment of the Iron Blockade, Kaoul held the rank of agent, and he was stationed at an Imperial outpost on Nar Hypa, in the Mataou system. Despite the flock of interrogator droids that protected him, Agent Kaoul was killed in a fight with a young smuggler who had broken into the outpost to steal a seized shipload of XJ9 hyperchargers.\nAgent Kaoul first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising. He was the end boss of the story mission \"The Second Facility.\"",
