 "content": "\"Ince\" was the nickname of a clone trooper in Torrent Company during the Clone Wars.\nAlong with several other troopers, including Sergeant Coric in 22 BBY, Ince accompanied Captain Rex to JanFathal as part of a mission aimed at rescuing the captured Republic Intelligence agent Hallena Devis. He received a severe wound to his thigh, just above the knee, and while he was kept alive and transported back to the Republic warship Leveler, he succumbed to his injuries shortly thereafter. He only had eight days of service out of Kamino.\nInce was considered the \"funny man\" of his squad. He often had a witty remark at the ready, whatever the situation.\nInce first appeared in the 2009 book The Clone Wars: No Prisoners by Karen Traviss.",
