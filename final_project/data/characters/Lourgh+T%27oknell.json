 "content": "Lourgh T'oknell was a Morseerian male pilot who held the rank of lieutenant in the New Republic's Flare Squadron during the Galactic Civil War. In 5 ABY, he flew a X-wing during a skirmish with the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing in the Ciaox Verith system, but was killed along with one other TIE pilot. T'oknell's brother was a comms officer who was stationed aboard the Deliverance in the comm room, and following his death, his brother had let Wyl Lark make unauthorized broadcasts because Lourgh was one of Lark's pilots and he was kind to him.\nLourgh T'oknell was first mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed.",
