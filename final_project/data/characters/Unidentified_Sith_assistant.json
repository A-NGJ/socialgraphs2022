 "content": "A human male assistant served Sith Lord Darth Vader on Coruscant shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire. In 19 BBY, the servant approached the Sith while he was meditating in his chamber. He informed the Dark Lord that the Imperial Security Bureau had discovered an incident in Imperial City that might involve a Jedi, who turned out to be Jocasta Nu. The Sith Lord told the cloaked figure to inform the ISB that he would arrive shortly.\nThe assistant appeared in Darth Vader  8. He is similar in appearance to the character Vaneé, who served Vader on Mustafar.\nAccording to a story told by Lellis in Star Wars Adventures: Shadow of Vader's Castle, however, Vaneé did not begin serving Vader until after the construction of Fortress Vader, meaning that the servant in Dark Lord of the Sith 8 cannot be the same as Vaneé. When asked of this to Cavan Scott on twitter, he simply replied by saying that the unidentified Sith assistant is part of the same semi-religious order as Vaneé and that the robes the servant was wearing is the robes they wear, confirming that the servant is indeed not Vaneé.",
