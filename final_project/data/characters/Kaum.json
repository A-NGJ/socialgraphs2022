 "content": "Doctor Kaum was a male Mon Calamari scientist who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Kaum was an expert in weapons technology and, by the Battle of Yavin, his specialty was beam weapons. In 1 ABY, Dr. Kaum was recruited by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt to develop some weapons for his organization on the planet Tatooine. However, the arrival of the scientist on Tatooine was discovered by Lady Valarian, the leader of the Valarian criminal syndicate and main rival of Jabba. As the Mon Calamari did not know any of Jabba's thugs, Lady Valarian's lieutenant Ind tasked a spacer with picking him up before Jabba's men. The spacer thus encountered Kaum upon his arrival on Mos Eisley and escorted him back to Ind at the Lucky Despot. Unaware that he had been lured, Dr. Kaum later began to work for the Valarian syndicate.\nKaum was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Dr. Kaum was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Dr. Kaum was consequently removed from the game.",
