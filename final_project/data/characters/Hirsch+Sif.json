 "content": "Hirsch Sif was a Human male member of the Sif mercenaries who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. A powerful soldier, Hirsch was the brother of Doak and Erran Sif. After the Battle of Yavin, his sister Erran who was an Imperial spy betrayed the Empire and the Rebel Alliance and was wanted by both for selling information to the Hutts. She had thus fled from Corellia to Talus where she assembled a group of mercenaries. Hirsch and Doak Sif joined those mercenaries, based in a bunker in the Akazi Plains.\nHirsch Sif was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
