 "content": "\"Stak\" was a ARF clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic's Lightning Squadron during the Clone Wars and participated in the Battle of Ryloth.\nBorn on the planet Kamino and bred from the genes of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, this clone trooper, who would eventually receive the nickname of \"Stak,\" was, like all clones, cloned to fight and die for the Galactic Republic as a part of a massive clone army. The army was first pressed into service when Republic Jedi engaged the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Geonosis, which sparked the start of the galaxy-wide Clone Wars.\nDuring the Ryloth Campaign, Stak served as an ARF trooper in the 91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps's Lightning Squadron under Jedi General Mace Windu and Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds.\" He and the rest of Lightning Squadron assisted Windu in clearing a path for the All Terrain Tactical Enforcers when their forces came under attack by several Armored Assault Tanks.\nStak, alongside his fellow ARF trooper CT-6910 \"Razor,\" then volunteered to accompany Windu in locating Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters' hideout. Razor, Stak, and Windu then found the Twi'lek Resistance after they took out a droid patrol. They were then taken to their hideout. When they were inside Stak tried touch a blurrg, but the blurrg roared and Stak was told to be careful. Syndulla agreed to help the Republic. Later Stak took part in infiltrating Lessu with Windu and Razor. Together, they were able stow aboard one of the Multi-Troop Transports loaded with treasure across the Plasma bridge. When droids scanned and discovered the three of them, Razor and Stak were then Force-pushed by Windu across the bridge. Razor and Stak then lifted and followed Windu into Lessu. Razor and Stak then went to the control room where they eliminated the battle droids and activated the bridge in time to allow both the freedom fighters' blurrgs and Lightning Squadron's All Terrain Reconnaissance Transports to cross. They then defended the control against B1-series battle droids and a pair of BX-series droid commandos.",
