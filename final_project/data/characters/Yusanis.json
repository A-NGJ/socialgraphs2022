 "content": "Yusanis was a legendary Echani general, prior to and during the Mandalorian Wars.\nAs famous as he was in melee combat and strategy, Yusanis was just as infamous for fathering his sixth daughter, Brianna, through an illicit affair with Jedi Master Arren Kae. When the affair was brought to light, Arren Kae was exiled from the Jedi Order, and the two of them left to join Revan in the Mandalorian Wars.\nTheir daughter would never know her mother, or even remember her face—Kae was said to have perished in the final battle of the war on Malachor V, yet her body was never recovered.\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, Yusanis discovered that the Sith Lord Darth Revan had assassinated an Echani senator, and challenged Revan to a duel. Despite his great skill in melee combat and use of his finely crafted double-bladed sword, he was slain by the Dark Lord.\nYusanis's death had a severe impact on the Echani just as Revan had intended; by destabilizing their government Revan prevented the Echani from seceding from the Galactic Republic, keeping the Republic's political and economic infrastructure intact.\nYusanis's death would be later commemorated by a limited production of personal dueling shields, which boasted superior protection over even the most expensive mass-produced military grade models. Somehow Yusanis's personal blade ended up in the hands of a Paaerduag merchant on Tatooine by the name of Mic'tunan'jus Orgu, during the Jedi Civil War.",
