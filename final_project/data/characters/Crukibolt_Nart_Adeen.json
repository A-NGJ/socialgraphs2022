 "content": "Crukibolt Nart Adeen, known as Crufeela, was a Corellian Shani female singer who lived during the High Republic Era. Notorious for her penchant for eating creatures from endangered species, Crufeela was wanted in multiple star systems for violating environmental laws. On one occasion, after a scandal involving endangered papdoos, Crufeela attempted to make a comeback by performing the song \"Corellia for Corellians\" on a galactic talent show, but it was quickly discovered that she was lying about having written the song and had been lip-synching to a voice recording of a Naboo teenager. Around 230 BBY, Crufeela was hired to perform at the Finance Ball after Svi'no Atchapat had to pull out. Atchapat's friend Alys Ongwa, the head of Supreme Coronet City Diplomat Protection, was working with the Jedi to uncover Nihil corruption in the Coronet City government, and set up a sting operation with Padawans Reath Silas and Ram Jomaram to entrap Crufeela with a meal from an endangered species, leading to her arrest by the Coronet City Chapter of the Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts.",
