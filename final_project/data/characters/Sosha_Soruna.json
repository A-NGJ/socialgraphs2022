 "content": "Sosha Soruna was a human female monarch who ruled as Queen of the Royal House of Naboo during the Age of the Galactic Empire. In accordance with the posthumous instructions of the late Emperor Palpatine, Naboo and several other key planets were targeted for annihilation under Operation: Cinder. Hoping to prevent the devastation that the Imperial Military would unleash on the Naboo homeworld, Queen Soruna joined forces with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, thereby committing Naboo to the Rebel cause in the waning months of the Galactic Civil War. She made a chromium donation to the New Republic after the battle.\nSosha Soruna earned a fighter pilot certification a year before her election as Queen of Naboo. In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, where the Alliance to Restore the Republic defeated the authoritarian Galactic Empire, Queen Soruna—whose world had been a member of the democratic government that preceded the Empire—became a potential ally for Mon Mothma, Chancellor of the Alliance. Some twenty days after Endor, Soruna received a visit from Leia Organa, princess of the destroyed planet Alderaan, who acted as the Alliance envoy to Naboo.\nDuring Organa's visit, it transpired that the Empire was using an array of satellites to disrupt the climate of Naboo and provoke typhoons that would render the planet uninhabitable. Although Naboo had been demilitarized years earlier, Queen Soruna still had access to a few remaining N-1 starfighters, which she made available to Organa and her aide, the Alliance pilot Shara Bey. In addition to providing crafts that could destroy the Empire's satellites, the queen decided to get involved in the dogfight herself, against the advice of her head of security, Captain Korro. Soruna, Organa and Bey formed a temporary flight group. While Shara Bey was trying to buy time, destroying TIE fighters that came out of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Queen of Naboo and the Princess of Alderaan set off to locate and destroy the satellites. Together, Soruna and Organa destroyed at least nine satellites, with the queen blowing up the last of them. However, the Star Destroyer started moving toward the improvised flight group, whose three fighters could not match the new threat. Fortunately for them, an Alliance flotilla led by General Lando Calrissian came out of hyperspace at the eleventh hour, engaging the Imperial ships and allowing Soruna, Organa and Bey to disengage. After Organa and a force of rebel reinforcements defeated the subsequent Imperial ground invasion of Theed, Soruna made a donation of chromium to the New Republic, the successor state to the Rebel Alliance.\nSosha Soruna had black hair, brown eyes, and light skin. As a queen, she usually wore a headdress, makeup and a scar of remembrance. Soruna was kind to her allies, as the chromium donation she made to the New Republic was a generous one.",
