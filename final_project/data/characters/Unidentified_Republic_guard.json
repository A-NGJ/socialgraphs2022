 "content": "A Human male guard was affiliated with the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War with the Sith Empire. The Republic guard served on the planet Corellia during the Battle of Corellia, which occurred in the year 3640 BBY. While on Corellia, the guard was assigned to the forces commanded by Jedi Master Sumalee. At one point during the fighting, Sumalee ordered the guard to aide a smuggler turned privateer in protecting a Selonian named Curske during a mission to set charges and reopen underground routes to the Museum of Alien History.\nAll of the content with the Republic guard and opening the routes to the Museum of Alien History were cut from Star Wars: The Old Republic before it was released in 2011.",
