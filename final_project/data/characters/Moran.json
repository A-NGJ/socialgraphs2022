 "content": "Moran was a Twi'lek male Jedi Master stationed on Ilum around 3640 BBY.\nDuring the Battle of Ilum, Sith Lords Prejad, Shados, and Wenom slaughtered a forward camp of the Republic's alien allies. Normally, Master Moran would not resort to payment in kind, but it was clear the Sith Lords would not negotiate, so he had to ask a group of Republic heroes for assistance in defeating them. The heroes smoked out and defeated the Sith Lords one by one, while also eliminating their forces, releasing alien captives and obtaining Imperial battle plans.\nMaster Moran appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a quest giver for a heroic mission Darkness on Ilum. The mission is intended for a group of at least two players and can be skipped, as well as its bonus mission Alien Extraction. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means both missions are completed.",
