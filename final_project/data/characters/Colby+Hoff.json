 "content": "Colby Hoff was a Human male and formerly a pesky business competitor of Prince Xizor, the leader of the Black Sun crime syndicate. After a failed gamble to outsmart Xizor left him ruined, Colby committed suicide by firing a blaster into his mouth and blowing off the back of his head.\nSeeking to avenge his father's death, Hoff's son later ambushed Xizor inside a protected corridor on the planet Coruscant in 3.5 ABY. Xizor calmly subdued his assailant and snapped the young man's neck after remarking that Colby Hoff was foolish to have challenged him.\nColby Hoff was first mentioned in the 1996 novel Shadows of the Empire, written by Steve Perry. The 1998 Star Wars Encyclopedia and the 2000 A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded state that Xizor had Colby Hoff murdered, but the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia later clarified that Hoff committed suicide, which matches the description from the novel.",
