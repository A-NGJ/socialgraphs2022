 "content": "Geeda was a female Rodian from Nar Shaddaa. She was a trader and owned a shop on the Smugglers' Moon while working as a spy for the Republic. Geeda encountered Meetra Surik when the latter came to the planet in search for Zez-Kai Ell, a missing Jedi Master.\nFellow merchant Oondar wanted to remove Geeda because she was stealing his customers and offered Surik a discount if she would promise to do so. Geeda, in response, matched the discount. Oondar then threatened Surik; however, Surik decided to let Geeda stay and removed Oondar after hearing Geeda's words of wisdom about the two possible paths in the scenario—one quick and easy, the other longer and perhaps more fulfilling—which served as a metaphor for Surik's choices in pursuing the light or dark side of the Force.\nAfter extending her search for the Lost Jedi to Dantooine and Dxun, Surik offered Geeda trading between her shop and Khoonda and the Mandalorians. This greatly helped Geeda's business by getting her new items for lower costs.\nIf the player decides to pursue the dark-side option, the Exile removes Geeda instead of Oondar and gets a discount from the latter.\nAfter getting Onderon stabilized, the exile can talk to Geeda and establish a trade route and the exile can buy a HK pacifism package and when the player installs it into HK-47, he acts kind, and gentle but the player eventually gets tired of him and takes it out.",
