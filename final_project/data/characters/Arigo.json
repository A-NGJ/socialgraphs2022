 "content": "Arigo was the nickname of a Human male agent of The Exchange on Ord Mantell, working in weapons trafficking. He was Zeerid Korr's contact until 3653 BBY, when Arigo was presumed killed by a group of pirates or mercenaries, which included Scar and No Scar. Korr was scheduled to deliver a weapons shipment to Arigo, but instead encountered Scar and his gang. They posed as men sent by Arigo, but Korr realized the situation and killed the men.",
