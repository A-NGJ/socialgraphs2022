 "content": "A Sith male lived in the territory of the Sith Empire sometime during the time period between 3950 BBY and the end of the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Near the end of his life, the man was utilized by the Sith Emperor as his Voice, or host body. Like the other Voices, the elderly Sith male was eventually replaced with a new Voice when he died.\nThis Sith male was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Voice of the Emperor in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. The Sith Warrior mission \"The Voice of Darkness\" confirms that the Voice must either die of natural causes or be killed in order to free the Emperor's essence, meaning that the Sith Voice must have died naturally or have been killed for the Emperor to have gained a new host.",
