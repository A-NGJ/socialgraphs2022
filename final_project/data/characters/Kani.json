 "content": "Kani was a Hutt who was a member of the Grand Hutt Council during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY Kani and the rest of the Council was invited to a auction on the planet Jekara for the carbonite encased body of Han Solo that was hosted by the returning Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate. After the conclusion of the auction, which saw Council member Jabba Desilijic Tiure claim Solo at the cost of one million credits the Sith Lord Darth Vader claimed possession of Solo, and Jabba ultimately surrounded Solo to Vader in order to maintain the relationship of the Hutt Clan with the Empire. After Jabba departed, Bokku, who felt insulted by what Jabba had allowed to happen, appealed to Kani and Meeka about whether he was right that the Council represented their people, their honor, and their power. Meeka reaffirmed that Bokku spoke the truth, though Kani did not respond.",
