 "content": "Hoole was a male researcher who looked after Zak and Tash Arranda. The Arrandas, alongside a droid, assisted him in his work. On one occasion, Hoole tasked his charges with studying energy spiders, though the two were disinterested, wishing to instead research the Jedi Knights. Hoole insisted that the spiders were dangerous and that research was critical, insisting that they complete the task. The two Arrandas sneaked away during the night while Hoole was asleep to investigate a nearby cave, where they had a run-in with a group of cultists.\nIn the new Star Wars canon, Hoole first appeared in the comic story \"Tales of Villainy: Grave Digger,\" written by Dave Scheidt, illustrated by Stefano Simeone, and published in Star Wars Adventures 10 by IDW Publishing on September 29, 2021. Mammon Hoole previously featured alongside Zak and Tash Arranda in the novel series Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, written by John Whitman.",
