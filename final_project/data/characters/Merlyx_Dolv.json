 "content": "Merlyx Dolv was a Human male processing agent for the Imperial Transport Commission who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nMerlyx Dolv was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Merlyx Dolv spawned under the generic \"corsec_agent\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of four possible depictions. He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male wearing either an officer's uniform or a pilot's jumpsuit, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female wearing either the officer's uniform or pilot's jumpsuit. Because the quest dialogue identified Dolv as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, the type of clothing he wore cannot be definitively determined.",
