 "content": "Propti Xaroon was a female Twi'lek mercenary who lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War. She was one of the leading members of the Azure Cabal, a mercenary organization that operated in many parts of the galaxy.\nXaroon used to be an entertainer. When she was young, a conman named Andro Hoverdale robbed her of everything she owned. She performed for him and Hoverdale stole her family jewels, her identity chips, and all of her money.\nBy 1 ABY, Xaroon had become a member of the Azure Cabal, a mercenary organization led by Loruna Scathe. She stayed in the city of Mos Espa on Tatooine where her background as an entertainer enabled her to hang around in the local cantinas and hear things that others could not.\nIn 1.5 ABY, Scathe sent an adventurer to Xaroon that wanted to become a member of the Cabal. But the adventurer needed the endorsements of Scathe's trusted inner circle first, including Xaroon's. Xaroon did her own dirty work and didn't really need any help with her current operations. But then she remembered her belongings that had been stolen by Hoverdale and decided to give the spacer a chance. She gave the spacer the coordinates to Hoverdale's Hideout and asked the adventurer to bring back as much of her stolen property as possible. Soon the spacer returned and presented Propti's old pouch that contained some of the things that were stolen from her. Xaroon was very thankful and sent her endorsement to Scathe.\nPropti Xaroon was a Non-Player Character  in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. She could be found in the city of Mos Espa on Tatooine. Xaroon was part of the Azure Cabal quest line, which was added to the game with Chapter 6: Dangers of the Wild in May 2007. In order to become a member of the Azure Cabal, the player had to complete a series of missions for Xaroon and three other Cabal members.",
