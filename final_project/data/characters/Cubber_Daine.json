 "content": "Cubber Daine was one of the mechanics assigned to Wraith Squadron shortly after their formation as a temporary squadron. Cubber worked with Kell Tainer to get and keep the squadron's X-wings, TIE fighters, and their CR90 corvette in running order.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Cubber Daine served for a year on Hoth. As a mechanic, he relied especially on a treadwell droid to assist him in his repairs, as he found the many appendages and arms of this type of droid highly useful. He would show his treadwell to others, informing them about its usefulness. He was known for doing favors, such as modifying R2 units, in return for pilot training. He also hated factory-new X-wings, because they had a tendency to malfunction.\nHe did, however, have a tendency to lie about how much it would take to fix them, so that Wedge Antilles would think he was working harder than he was. He had a six-year old daughter, who he claimed could lie better than Kell Tainer.\nHe was the father of Zindra Daine, a fighter pilot during the Yuuzhan Vong War.",
