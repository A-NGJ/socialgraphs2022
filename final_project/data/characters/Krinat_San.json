 "content": "Krinat San was a male Rodian smuggler who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A friend of the Republic, San could be found aboard the space station Carrick Station.\nKrinat San appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendor for the Smuggler class; his actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history, as has his presence in the live game. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
