 "content": "Erl was a Human male who served as a member of the Imperial Star Destroyer crew commanded by Major Voss. Their ship was part of the secret armada commanded by Admiral Mils Giel, tasked with transporting a mysterious creature known as the teezl to the Imperial capital. However, their ship was hit by an attack of Rebels piloting modified TIE/LN starfighters, and Voss immediately ordered Erl and his crewmates to return fire. Erl and one other member of the crew were skeptical of their chances of surviving the sneak attack.",
