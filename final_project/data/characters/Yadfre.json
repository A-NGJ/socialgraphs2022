 "content": "Yadfre was a male Trandoshan who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, working in Gadrin on the planet Cularin as a sergeant in the Office of Peace and Security, a local law enforcement unit. During the Clone Wars, Yadfre represented the Office of Peace and Security in a panel discussion about the presence of the Thaereian military in the Cularin system. Yadfre said little during the debate, and just as the discourse came to an end, he threw up his lunch out of view of the holorecorder.",
