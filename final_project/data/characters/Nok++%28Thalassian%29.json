 "content": "Nok was a Thalassian male slaver. The human child Kad was born enslaved to Nok while the slaver was expanding his operations on the planet Tatooine. When Kad was five years old, a local crime lord hired the Mandalorian mercenaries of Clan Awaud to destroy Nok's operation. During the mercenaries' attack, Kad warned the Mandalorians of a trap that Nok had set before the slaver could spring it. After the battle was over, the Mandalorian Avin Solus adopted Kad to raise as his own.\nNok was mentioned in Friends Like These, a 2015 adventure book written by Keith Kappel and Ryan K. Brooks for Fantasy Flight Games's Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game.",
