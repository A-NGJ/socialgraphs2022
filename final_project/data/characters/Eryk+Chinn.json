 "content": "Eryk Chinn was a Human male shadow stormtrooper who served as a sergeant in the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps during the Galactic Civil War. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Sergeant Chinn acted as the personal bodyguard for Colonel Dac Axfow, a paranoid Imperial officer who feared uprisings from the populace. At one point, Sergeant Chinn accompanied Colonel Axfow and his personal pilot, Lieutenant Logro Elsin, outside the starport in Kor Vella, a popular tourist city on the Core World of Corellia.\nA Human male by the name of Eryk Chinn served as a sergeant in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. As a member of the Stormtrooper Corps, Sergeant Chinn earned the distinction of becoming a specialized shadow stormtrooper, otherwise know as blackhole stormtroopers due to their association with Agent Blackhole, Director of Imperial Intelligence. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Sergeant Chinn was assigned the responsibility of acting as a personal bodyguard for a paranoid Imperial officer, a Human colonel by the name of Dac Axfow. Fearing uprisings from the local populace, Colonel Axfow kept Sergeant Chinn, as well as his personal pilot, Lieutenant Logro Elsin, nearby to handle any contingencies. Although Sergeant Chinn did not hold a high opinion of Colonel Axfow's sensibilities, he did not neglect his duties. At one point, Eryk Chinn and Logro Elsin accompanied their superior during a stay at Kor Vella, a popular tourist city on the Core World of Corellia.\nWhile idling about outside the Kor Vella Starport, Erykn Chinn respectfully turned away a spacer approaching the trio, out of fear that the colonel may perceive the individual as a threat, and react unpredictably.\nAlthough he was assigned as a personal bodyguard to Colonel Dac Axfow, Eryk Chinn did not hesitate to openly criticize his superior. On one occasion, Sergeant Chinn admitted that Colonel Axfow was \"short on common sense.\" Eryk Chinn, on the other hand, exercised restraint when it came to any potential threats. While guarding Colonel Axfow in Kor Vella, Eryk Chinn asked an approaching citizen to back away, out of a sense of duty to protect both the citizen and the unpredictably paranoid Imperial officer.\nWhile serving as a personal bodyguard for Colonel Axfow, Eryk Chinn wore black colored stormtrooper armor. This armor was specifically worn by Imperial shadow stormtroopes, and it consisted of unique components, including a harder form of duraplast called stygian-triprismatic polymer.\nEryk Chinn was a non-player character included with Jump to Lightspeed, the 2004 expansion pack for Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. In the game, Eryk Chinn would simply stand alongside Dac Axfow and Logro Elsin in the city of Kor Vella on the planet Corellia, and act as a type of \"NPC greeter.\" Although he was added to Star Wars Galaxies with the Jump to Lightspeed expansion, it was still possible for players without the expansion to interact with the character. When examined, the description for Sergeant Eryk Chinn identified him as a \"black hole stormtrooper.\"",
