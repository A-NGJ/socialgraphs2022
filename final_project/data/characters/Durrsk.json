 "content": "Durrsk was a Quarren crime lord on Nar Shaddaa. A large debt was owed to him by Tyrnia Masak's mother. When she defaulted on it, Durrsk took her daughter instead. His fighting master trained the girl as a gladiator, in which she excelled. Durrsk later killed Masak's mother one day in a fit of rage; at her next bout, Masak retaliated by killing the Quarren as well as his Hutt guest.\nThe Quarren's family later placed a bounty on Masak.",
