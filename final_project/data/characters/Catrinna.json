 "content": "Catrinna was a female Human who lived on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. During the war she worked as a thief and a con artist, partnering up with Carn Truuvik and his men in order to scam targets in rigged sabacc games at Truuvik's cantina, Bovo's. Catrinna would lure potential victims into the game and then allow her accomplices to work together to beat the players and claim all of their credits.\nBorn on the streets, the Human female Catrinna had come to work as a thief and con artist by the time of the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. She operated in Treasure Ship Row, a street in the Blue Sector of Coronet City, capital of the planet Corellia. For a period during the war she worked with Carn Truuvik, a successful criminal, and several other beings loyal to him. The group conned targets out of their credits through rigged sabacc games, which they ran at a cantina Truuvik owned named Bovo's. Catrinna's role in the con was to lure in potential marks, either by directly inviting them to the game or by using more cunning methods if necessary. One tactic she used was appealing to their more heroic side, staging a violent argument with one of Truuvik's men, the Rodian Grenzo, in which she pretended to owe her accomplice a large sum of credits. The act was meant to draw in potential targets who would step in a save Catrinna, promoting the Rodian to flee and the damsel in distress to spin a sob story about her debts in the hopes of being offered further aid. Catrinna would then suggest that her heroes could participate in a game of sabacc Grenzo planned to be part of, claiming they could split the profits to pay off her debt and still provide the marks with a reward. Once at the game Catrinna would offer any players she had brought hefty loans if necessary, unless she had used the debtee act, in which case Truuvik would give loans instead. Catrinna or Truuvik would then eventually suggest the targets put up a starship or similar prize as collateral, in the hopes taking possession of such a object would give them power over the victims of their scam. When targets managed to beat Truuvik and his accomplices, they would accept defeat and pay out as not to put others off future rigged games. Should the targets attempt to leave early Catrinna would attempt to persuade them otherwise, claiming their luck was just about to change.\nBannon first appeared as a character in the adventure module \"Sabacc Game on the Row\", one of several modules included in the Suns of Fortune sourcebook for the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system. The book, which was released in 2014, sets the players up as the target of Catrinna and Tuuvik's rigged game. It outlines various potential outcomes and",
