 "content": "A female sous-chef worked for the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs, who served as head chef at Takodana Castle on the planet Takodana until the castle's destruction in 34 ABY and then went on to start his own business, Tuggs' Grub. During the festive, mid-winter season, she at one point told Tuggs that if she had to hear the festive Huttese song \"Joh Blastoh\" one more time, she would punch someone. The Artiodac managed to talk the sous-chef down from violence and was later inspired by the conversation to create a beverage known as Joh Blastoh Punch. He included a recipe for the punch and mentioned the sous-chef in his second cookbook, The Life Day Cookbook, which he released at some point after publishing his first cookbook in 34 ABY.\nThe sous-chef was mentioned in the 2021 Star Wars: The Life Day Cookbook, a recipe book written by Jenn Fujikawa and Marc Sumerak.",
