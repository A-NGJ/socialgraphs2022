 "content": "Elodore Vane, a Human female from Valahari and a member of the House of Vane, was the Lady of Harko Vane, the Viscount of Valahari. After her husband was killed in what looked as Republic attack, but was secretly orchestrated by Count Dooku, her son Tofen Vane joined the Clone Wars on the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Elodore herself at some point even considered marrying Dooku, but after she received proof of his involvement in her husband's death, she resented him and vowed for her son to quit the war. Tofen, however, refused and was soon killed at the Battle of the Veil Nebula. Following his death, the Valahari stopped supporting both sides of the conflict. Sometime prior to the rise of the Empire, she was found dead in her home, asleep with a letter in her hand to Count Dooku.",
