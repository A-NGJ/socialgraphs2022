 "content": "Terba was a male Ugnaught who previously worked at Reklam Station but was arrested after he tried to escape from the station. At some point after his arrest, Terba and the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka ended up in a prison on the planet Naraka. In 2 BBY, the pair was rescued by the crew of the Ghost. However, Terba died in the prison escape, shot by an AT-DP.\nTerba was a male Ugnaught who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 2 BBY, he worked as a laborer at the Imperial junkyard Reklam Station which lay inside the gas planet of Yarma. He and his fellow Ugnaughts including Melch were used to dismantle various Old Republic starfighters including Y-wing starfighters. Terba tried to escape but was captured and sent to the Imperial prison on Naraka. There, he met the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka and told him about the Imperial operations at Reklam Station.\nHondo, who had been imprisoned by the Empire following a skirmish at Nixus Hub 218, contacted the Spectres and convinced them to help in return for sharing this information. Several members of the Phoenix Cell led by the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger raided the prison and rescued Hondo and Terba. The rebels particularly Sabine Wren were reluctant to rescue a second person until Hondo assured them that Terba knew secrets that were vital to the rebellion. During the escape attempt, Terba demanded a double share but was rebuffed by Hondo, who called him a \"greedy little pig.\" Snubbed, Terba broke free of the group and fled outside the prison only to be blasted to death by an Imperial AT-DP walker. Despite his death, Hondo shared the information on Reklam Station with the Phoenix Squadron.\nFollowing Terba's death, Grand Admiral Thrawn realized that the Phoenix rebels were going to attack Reklam Station after realizing that Terba had been Hondo's cellmate on Naraka. During the rebels' mission to Reklam Station, Hondo was able to convince the other Ugnaughts including Melch to assist them by telling them that he was a friend of Terba.\nAs an Ugnaught, Terba had a diminutive physique, porcine features, and spoke Ugnaught. He was an opportunist and only shared information about Reklam Station to Hondo Ohnaka in return for financial gain and freedom. When Hondo refused to give him a double share of the reward, Terba abandoned his companion. In his eagerness to escape from Naraka prison, Terba was fatally hit by laser fire from an Imperial AT-DP walker.\nTerba first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels episode Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow, which premiered on Disney XD on September 24, 2016. He was voiced by Jim Cummings, who also voiced the character Hondo Ohnaka.",
