 "content": "Tamoss, like his partner Daushoroc, was an Eirrauc and a former slave of the Galactic Empire. After escaping together, and settling some other escaped slaves on a safeworld, they became dealers in gems, curiosities, and rare artifacts.\nSometime during the Galactic Civil War, they arrived on Tatooine to search for the wreck of the Athallian Messenger. The two traders had to make peace with a tribe of Tusken Raiders just to get to the part of the desert the wrecked hull was said to be.",
