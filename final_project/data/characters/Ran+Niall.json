 "content": "Ran Niall was a male Human Imperial turned Rebel. In his time as an Imperial, he was a captain for the Imperial Navy. When Ran saw the atrocities the Empire had committed on Mon Cala, he became a turncoat, and joined the Rebel Alliance. He mentored Setenna Hase and Danel Qurno, teaching them everything he could. Ran was eventually killed during the Battle of the Gauntlet in an explosion after being left behind on Arda I Rebel base.\nWhen the Ardan resistance arrived on Jagomir, people felt remorse for Ran. People remembered his tough love when a rebel hotshot tried to get info from his peers by being extremely charismatic.",
