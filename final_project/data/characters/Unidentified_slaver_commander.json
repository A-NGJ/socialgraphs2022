 "content": "This slaver commander was in charge of a group of Imperial slavers on the planet Mandalore around 3 ABY. During a trek to lead a group of Mandalorian slaves back to the Imperial-held City of Bone, the commander's convoy was attacked by a raiding party led by Mandalore Fenn Shysa. The commander tried to stay out of the battle, as he held the controls to all the slaves' energy links.\nHowever, as the battle grew more fierce, Shysa sought out the commander, blasting him in the chest. The shot destroyed the controls to the energy links and killed the commander in the process. To keep anyone from repairing the controls that Shysa had destroyed, the Mandalorian removed the controls from the dead Imperial's body. While he was in the process of doing this, another slaver trained his blaster on Shysa, hoping to avenge his fallen commander. Before he could succeed, Princess Leia Organa killed the would-be avenger, saving Shysa's life.",
