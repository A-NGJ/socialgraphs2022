 "content": "A male member of the warlike Grysk species was the commander of the Grysk StoneCrusher-class WarMaster Armageddon, which was part of the Grysk operative Jixtus's fleet. Around 18 BBY, the Armageddon arrived in the Unknown Regions' Sunrise system with the other warships of Jixtus's fleet with sheer coordination provided by their respective Attendant navigators. Shortly after, a battle between the Grysk fleet and a fleet of Chiss starships began, during which the Armageddon faced off against the Chiss heavy cruiser Springhawk. After stopping all of the cruiser's breacher missile waves, the ship's commander, Mid Captain Ufsa'mak'ro, thought that the Armageddon's captain was \"damn good at his job.\"\nThe Springhawk attempted to flee with the StoneCrusher in pursuit; however, before the Grysk vessel caught the Chiss heavy cruiser, the Clarr light cruiser Orisson and the Chiss heavy cruiser Grayshrike used their breachers to impact the missile's acid into the Armageddon, damaging it significantly. Shortly after, the StoneCrusher was destroyed.\nThe Grysk was mentioned in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, written by Timothy Zahn as part of his Ascendancy Trilogy.",
