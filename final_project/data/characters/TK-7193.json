 "content": "TK-7193 was the designation of a human male who served in the Galactic Empire as an elite stormtrooper tasked with protecting Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin from all threats, prior to the Grand Moff's death during the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. He wore a set of stormtrooper armor with a black-colored pauldron, and wielded a DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle. The trooper had an exceptional strength, which allowed him to subdue enemies with a single strike from the butt of his blaster rifle.\nThe stormtrooper TK-7193 was introduced in Star Wars: Force Arena, a mobile game developed by Netmarble Games and released on January 12, 2017. The game was later discontinued on March 18, 2019.\nTwo stormtroopers that match TK-7193's description previously appeared in \"Call to Action,\" the thirteenth episode of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels' first season. In the episode, set in the year 4 BBY, they accompany Grand Moff Tarkin during his visit to the planet Lothal to personally handle the rebel group known as the Spectres.",
