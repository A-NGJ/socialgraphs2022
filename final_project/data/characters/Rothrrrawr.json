 "content": "Rothrrrawr was a Wookiee Chieftain who died several years before the Jedi Civil War.\nRothrrrawr was famous for traveling to the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, and breaking Bacca's Ceremonial Blade in two when fighting a terentatek. The blade was stuck in the beast's hide, and Rothrrawr fled with the hilt. Afterwards, the hilt was seen as a symbol of leadership in his tribe, and was passed from chieftain to chieftain until Revan arrived on Kashyyyk, reuniting the blade and hilt.",
