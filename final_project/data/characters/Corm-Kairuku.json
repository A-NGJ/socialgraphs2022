 "content": "Corm-Kairuku was a net-maker for the Visitors, a group consisting of all of the male Lanais from the population inhabiting Temple Island on the planet Ahch-To. He and the other Visitors were responsible for providing the food for the population, and so traveled on a fleet of hand-crafted vessels to other islands while hunting and fishing. After the fleet had gathered supplies, they would return to temple island once per month, delivering food to the female Lanais and then celebrating with them in a multi-day festival. Corm-Kairuku wore a blue byssus-wool smock over a brown robe, with a hat featuring a dried crinoid frondtrailer. His eyes were blue and his skin was a mixture of gray and white.\nCorm-Kairuku was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release. Despite this, the character still appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film on December 15, 2017.",
