 "content": "Nuriin-Ar was a male Korun terrorist who led a group of three other Korunnai and held six Galactic Republic civilians, including a Mon Calamari senator and his aide and a member of the CSA Direx Board hostage for three hours. The plan was to get the Coruscant Security Force to burst in and accidentally kill the Direx Board member, thereby causing a huge political fallout between the CSA and the Republic, and possibly causing the well-armed Corporate Sector to ally themselves with the Separatists.\nThe plan almost worked, but a squad of clone commandos, Omega Squad, was sent into rescue the hostages instead of the CSF. During the twenty-second long fight Nuriin-Ar was killed almost instantly by a well-placed blaster round from one of the commandos.",
