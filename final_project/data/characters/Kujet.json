 "content": "Kujet was a Male Force-sensitive Zeffo held up as one of the greatest, if infamous, of the culture's icons. A Zeffo Sage, the ancient figure was a ruthless authoritarian shrouded in the dark side of the Force.\nKujet was a Zeffo Sage who established a great palace on the planet Dathomir centuries before the fall of the Galactic Republic. Withdrawn in comparison to other great Sages of the Zeffo, Kujet's palace was secluded and difficult to reach during the height of the individual Zeffo's power. Reigning in the time after Sages Eilram and Miktrull, Kujet was a ruthless leader who ordered the destruction of the astriums the species used in their religious practices.\nThe followers of Kujet were promised power and control over the Life Wind, yet the Sage proved to be treacherous and cruel. From the seat of power on Dathomir, Kujet staged a massacre in the halls of his palace, reducing resistance to ashen ruin. When Kujet died, he was entombed within a sarcophagus then placed upon the walls of the his great temple. Within Kujet's dead hands held one of the last remaining astriums. The dark side practitioner's reign marked the decline of Zeffo culture, and his resting place was left abandoned.",
