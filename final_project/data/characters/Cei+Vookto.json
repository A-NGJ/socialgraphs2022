 "content": "Cei Vookto was a Duros male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He trained two Padawans, including the Human Dama Montalvo. Three months into the war, Vookto was dispatched to the planet Lianna to defend a Sienar Fleet Systems starfighter facility from the Separatists. He was slain during the ensuing battle when he sacrificed himself so that the soldiers under his command could survive a Separatist attack. After the Republic won the battle, Vookto's body was given a funeral pyre on Lianna, which was attended by Montalvo and several Jedi Masters, including Yoda and Mace Windu.\nCei Vookto, a Duros male, was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. True to his heritage as a Duros, Vookto enjoyed traveling, embarking on long missions along the Outer Rim Territories. When he returned from his missions to the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, he told stories of his adventures to any Jedi who would listen. He eventually took an individual as his Padawan learner.\nBy the year 22 BBY, after Vookto trained his first Padawan to Knighthood, he selected the Human Dama Montalvo as his next apprentice. When the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted in that year, Vookto returned to Coruscant per the Jedi High Council's instructions and assumed a command position within the Grand Army of the Republic. Three months into the war, Vookto, Montalvo, and the clone troopers under their command were dispatched to the planet Lianna in order to defend a Sienar Fleet Systems starfighter factory—which was essential for the Republic—from an attack by the Separatists.\nDuring the ensuing battle, Vookto sacrificed himself by using his abilities at summoning the elements, which caused a pillar of fire and a pillar of water to cleanse the planet. Although Vookto perished due to his usage of the Force, his squadron of soldiers survived an attack from the enemy. After the Republic secured a victory against the Separatists, Vookto was given a funeral pyre, which was attended by Jedi Masters Yoda, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Tholme, and Quinlan Vos. Also in attendance were Vookto's Padawan Montalvo—who was assigned to Ki-Adi-Mundi's command—and at least two of the troopers who had been under the Duros Jedi's command.\nCei Vookto was remembered by Master Yoda for having a quiet voice and a dry sense of humor. He also made it a point to tell Yoda and other Jedi tales of his travels. Vookto obeyed the Council's decrees without hesitation, and took a commanding role in the Republic's Grand Army. The Duros was a capable leader, and was willing to risk his life for the clone troopers under his command.\nVookto was sensitive to the Force, and was capable enough to ascend to the rank of Jedi Master. He managed to successfully train one Padawan during his career, and tutored Dama Montalvo prior to perishing on Lianna. During the battle at Lianna, Vookto utilized his abilities at summoning the elements to cleanse the planet; however, the exertion from the effort eventually caused him to lose his life.\nCei Vookto was first mentioned in the comic book Jedi: Mace Windu, which was released on February 26, 2003 and written by John Ostrander. His role in the Battle of Lianna was expanded on in The New Essential Chronology, released in October 25, 2005. Vookto also gained an entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
