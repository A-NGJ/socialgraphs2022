 "content": "Frei Aycen was a noted Corellian pirate operating during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. An idealistic woman, she saw through the corruption that plagued the Galactic Senate, and was known to steal cargoes and supplies while ensuring that her victims were not harmed in any way. Her pirate fleets consisted of a number of CloakShape fighters and small transports, all of which were protected by the modified IPV-1 System Patrol Craft, the Freejack.",
