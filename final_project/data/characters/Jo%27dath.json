 "content": "Jo'dath, also known as Jo'dath the Exile, was a male Kadas'sa'Nikto who lived in the dangerous region of the planet Tatooine known as the Outlaw's Den during the Cold War. An exile, Jo'dath made camp in the northern reaches of the canyon area, and spoke of a \"she\" that supposedly \"needed him.\" He often traded goods for food, but sometimes grew angry at outsiders and demanded that they leave \"her\" alone.\nJo'dath appears as a Black Market vendor in the Outlaw's Den, an open-world PvP zone on Tatooine in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
