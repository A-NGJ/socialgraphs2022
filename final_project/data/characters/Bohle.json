 "content": "Bohle was a female miner who lived in the mining town of Torbel during the Clone Wars. The mother of Greti, Bohle was a worker who suffered from damotite poisoning.\nIn 21 BBY, Bohle was present when Torbel was occupied by General Lok Durd of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After been forced to leave her job along with other miners, she suffered from damotite poisoning and was afflicted with a terrible fever. When the village was visited by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, Bohle was nearly close to dying from the poison, but her daughter was able to heal her with the Force. After recovering from the illness, Bohle traveled to Naboo where she and the people of Lanteeb were offered sanctuary by Queen Jamillia of Theed.",
