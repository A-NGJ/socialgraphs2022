 "content": "Berl was a Human male pilot of the Rebel Alliance who flew an X-wing starfighter under the command of Luke Skywalker. Some time after the Battle of Hoth, Berl and fellow Rebel pilot Cinda Tarheel attended Skywalker as wing-men on a mission to the planet Serphidi. Rebel Intelligence had learned that the Serphidian monarch, King S'Shah, had been engaging in talks with the Galactic Empire. The Rebels' mission was to oust King S'Shah before the Imperials could establish a permanent foothold on Serphidi. Moments after landing their fighters, the pilots came upon several Serp warriors armed with lances, riding atop lizard-mounts, and Berl was killed in the ensuing confrontation.\nBerl appeared in Star Wars  64, written by David Michelinie and Michael Fleisher, illustrated by Joe Brozowski and released in 1982.",
