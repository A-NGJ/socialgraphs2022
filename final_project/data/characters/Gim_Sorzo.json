 "content": "Gim Sorzo was the male Twi'lek gunner on board the Rover during the Second Galactic Civil War. He went under the name Spacer First Class Sorzo. Under the command of Jedi apprentice Ben Skywalker, Sorzo as well as Junior Lieutenant Beta Ioli and Chief Petty Officer Tanogo traveled to Terephon in order to rescue Jaina Solo and Zekk. Gim and Skywalker went EV with Jaina and Zekk before the Rover was destroyed during an attempt to contact Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo. They were rescued by the Millennium Falcon shortly thereafter but were once again forced to jettison after the Falcon was heavily damaged during an assault by the Galactic Alliance Guard Star Destroyer Anakin Solo.",
