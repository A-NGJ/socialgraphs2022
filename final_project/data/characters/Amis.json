 "content": "Amis was a Mandalorian human male cadet of the Royal Academy of Government on Mandalore during the Clone Wars. In the course of his academic career, he attended classes with several friends, including Korkie Kryze—nephew to Duchess Satine Kryze of the New Mandalorians. Although Amis and his companions managed to expose a black market conspiracy on their homeworld, they were unable to save the Duchess during the rise of Death Watch.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Amis was a cadet of the Royal Academy of Government in Sundari, the capital city of the planet Mandalore. As a student, he was groomed for a political career in order to lead the next generation of Mandalorians. In the course of his academic career, he maintained friendships with fellow cadets Lagos, Soniee, and Korkie Kryze—the young nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze of the New Mandalorian government.\nAs the war progressed across the galaxy between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Amis and his classmates received a guest speaker from the Jedi Order—Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic and apprentice of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Inspired by Tano's lecture, Korkie convinced his friends to investigate the food shortage in the city, an activity which Amis preferred over hunger. With Tano's help, they discovered an illegal operation established by Prime Minister Almec, who sought to use the black market trade network as an economic asset for Mandalore. Due to the efforts of Amis and his classmates, Almec was arrested and sent to prison.\nIn the aftermath of Death Watch's rise to power, Amis aided his friends and the Nite Owls in an attempt to rescue Korkie's deposed aunt. Their plan ultimately failed, however, consequently leading to Satine's execution as the capital became engulfed in a state of civil war.\nIn his time, Amis was one of the most promising cadets of the Royal Academy of Government, a prestigious institution that trained the best and brightest of Mandalorian youth to pursue careers in politics. Amongst his fellow cadets, Amis was noted for his flippant attitude and high-spirited nature. However, he was also highly intelligent and loyal to his friends, having assisted them in revealing the corruption at the highest level of Mandalorian politics. Despite the rise of Death Watch as the new power on Mandalore, Amis continued to support his comrades while attempting to save Duchess Satine from the Mandalorian super commandos.\nAmis was a human male. As an adolescent, he had blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin. By the time of the New Mandalorian government's collapse, he had a shaved head.\nAmis first appeared in \"The Academy,\" the sixth episode in Season Three of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. He was portrayed by voice actor Omid Abtahi, who reprised the role in the fifth season episode \"The Lawless.\"",
