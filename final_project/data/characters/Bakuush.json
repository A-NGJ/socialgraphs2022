 "content": "Bakuush was a Hutt who had a palace on the planet Nal Hutta. Bakuush founded the industrial town of Jiguuna on Nal Hutta, and the city became a thriving town that served as an operational hub for the mines and factories nearby. At the age of one hundred years, Bakuush was honored in a centennial feast in the Hutt's palace. Orpali dragons were on the menu for the feast when several dragon hatchlings escaped into the palace's sewers, and over time, those hatchlings evolved into the creatures known as chemilizards as they adapted to Nal Hutta's toxic swamps. Under Bakuush's rule, Jiguuna was a booming and influential town, but when Bakuush died in a mechanical accident two centuries before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the town was enveloped in gang wars and anarchy.\nBakuush the Hutt was first mentioned in the Codex entries for chemilizard and Jiguuna in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released by BioWare in 2011.",
