 "content": "Rove was an ambassador of the resurgent Sith Empire to the Hutt Cartel during the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. He replaced Unar in that position after his predecessor was executed by Supreme Mogul Karagga.\nRove was a Human male member of the Imperial Diplomatic Service during the Galactic War, between Sith Empire and Galactic Republic. In 3639 BBY, the Hutt Cartel started attacking and annexing neutral systems and its leader—the Supreme Mogul Karagga—had the Imperial ambassador Unar, killed.\nServing as Unar's replacement, Ambassador Rove to the Hutts, he assigned the protocol droid YD-33 to recruit Imperial champions on Vaiken Spacedock. He met with his recruits and the Hutt Cartel's envoy, Ambassador Grub, aboard the diplomatic vessel Ziost Shadow.\nFair-skinned and with dark brown eyes, Rove was a diplomat but believed in the use of violence when deemed necessary.",
