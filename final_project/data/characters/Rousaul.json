 "content": "Rousaul was a female Twi'lek doctor residing on Dromund Kaas around 3643 BBY, when she was killed by an Empire-affiliated individual. She was part of a secret Republic mission to spy on Kaas City.\nRousaul appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Dromund Kaas. She is not directly involved in any quests, however she appears in the area for the mission \"Into the Maw\" and can be killed by any Imperial character for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means she was killed.",
