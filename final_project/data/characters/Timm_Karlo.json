 "content": "Timm Karlo was a human male who worked at Caleen Salyard on Ferrix with his lover Bix Caleen. Karlo reported the wanted Cassian Jeron Andor to Preox-Morlana because he thought Caleen was cheating on him with Andor. He was shot and killed by Preox-Morlana officers after attempting to help Caleen, who had been detained by them after trying to get closer. By the time Andor returned to Ferrix after the Mission on Aldhani, it was common knowledge that he was the one who had reported Andor.\nHe was portrayed by James McArdle.",
