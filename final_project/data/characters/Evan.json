 "content": "Evan was a young Human farmboy from the planet Garqi.\nEvan's parents were killed during a battle between Separatist and Galactic Republic forces. Their deaths left Evan an orphan, and he went into hiding where he was discovered by the clone commandos in Aiwha Squad. While traveling with Aiwha Squad, \"Sarge\" received Order 66, and Evan watched in shock as the squad killed Jedi Master Traavis.\nEvan was unwilling to leave his home with the clone commandos, but did warm up to them. In contrast to being terrified at the confrontation with a homing spider droid, he said it was \"awesome\". He was fascinated by the Jedi and shocked at the byproduct of Order 66.\nEvan was created by Ryan Kaufman for the short story Orders, which was featured in the fourth volume of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures trade paperbacks. He was drawn by Rick Lacy. Evan received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
