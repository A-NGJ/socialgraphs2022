 "content": "Barnibus was a pink-skinned, pink-eyed, tame rancor that lived during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war, the rancor was a smaller size than the normal height of a fully grown rancor, standing only slightly taller than an adult Human.\nBarnibus first appeared as a rare companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures, which was released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010 and shut down in 2014. The rancor could only be obtained as a random reward from a sealed cargo crate, an object which players earned by completing mini-games and then had to open using access codes bought with station cash, a premium in-game currency. Barnibus was one of many possible items a player could obtain from such a crate. Given that obtaining Barnibus was entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about if it was owned by a character.",
