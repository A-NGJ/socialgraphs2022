 "content": "Stephax Dain was a Human male who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he was a lieutenant of the Meatlump gang, a Corellian technology-hating terrorist organization. In 1 ABY, Stephax Dain launched an ambitious attack on a Weapons Research Facility located on Naboo's moon of Rori. However, a rival Meatlump lieutenant by the name of Kaiya Merel was not keen on letting Dain take all the credit of this action. She tasked a new Meatlump recruit to search Stephax Dain's camp near Kor Vella. The spacer found a well-worn notebook that contained detailed information about Stephax's plans. Kaiya Merel therefore ordered her recruit to disrupt the facility operations before her rival but Stephax and his Meatlump pronks had already taken over the facility when the spacer arrived on Rori. The adventurer attacked the Meatlumps to take control of the research facility, killing Stephax Dain and a number of pronks.\nStephax Dain appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Stephax Dain was added to the game with the update dubbed \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King,\" released on June 19, 2008.\nThis non-player character  was known in the game as Stephax Dain or Dephax Stain, depending of the Combat Level  of the player. If the player performed the quest \"The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 7\" during the leveling of their character , the NPC would be named Stephax Dain. If the player performed the quest after the end of the game , the NPC would be named Dephax Stain. Multiple story elements indicated that the quest was intended to be achieved at CL 65.",
