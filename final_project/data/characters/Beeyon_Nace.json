 "content": "Beeyon Nace was once an aspiring logistics clerk on Coruscant. After being caught with the Governor's daughter, he was sent to Tatooine where he served as an assistant to the Imperial Prefect. His duties included logging the incoming and outgoing ships at the local spaceport. Nace was also known to have frequently visited Chalmun's Cantina.\nHe was once blackmailed by the Ccalras Corporation when his lover Eila betrayed him. After a group of spacers rescued her, they chased off the thugs and they sought shelter with Abbot Drayk.",
