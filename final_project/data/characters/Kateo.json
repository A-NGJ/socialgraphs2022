 "content": "Kateo, also known as \"Killer\" Kateo, was a Zabrak male criminal during the Cold War. Among his exploits stood his slaughter of a squad of Galactic Republic soldiersâ€”a feat he accomplished using only a shiv. Kateo was eventually apprehended by Republic forces and send to the prison world of Belsavis to serve his sentence in the maximum-security detention facility known as Belsavis prison. When the reconstituted Sith Empire learned of the prison's existence and launched an attack to free Republic convicts and Sith prisoners of war, Kateo was released and conscripted into Imperial Military service.",
