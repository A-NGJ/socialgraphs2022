 "content": "Dasha Promenti was a human female member of the Church of the Force, who lived in Tuanul village on the planet Jakku. There, along with the other villagers, she followed an ascetic lifestyle which rejected comfort, luxury and the trappings of war. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Promenti was present in the village when it was attacked by sixty stormtroopers of the First Order, who were searching for the village resident Lor San Tekka and the map fragment he possessed. Promenti and the other surviving villagers, including Tekka, were then rounded up and executed by the First Order forces. Promenti wore a simple linen dress dyed turquoise underneath a fantabu-fur fringed sleeveless overcoat, which she tied the Sash of the Balanced on top of. She kept her brown hair unadorned and had fair skin. In her final battle, she fought using a blaster pistol with a handle made from a carved dune zaywar tusk.\nDasha Promenti was portrayed by Ana-Maria Leonte in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, although her name was first revealed in an exclusive article on Wired.com detailing a number of the prop weapons used in the film, published several weeks before the film's released in 2015. Which character in the film was Promenti was then revealed by the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.\nThough the character's role in The Force Awakens was minimal, the 2016 video game LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens gave a more important role to Dasha Promenti during the attack on Tuanul sequence. There, she joins Poe Dameron and BB-8 in their–ultimately unsuccessful– escape attempt from Tuanul. Unlike her canon counterpart, she seemingly survives the First Order's attack by escaping to a safe location along with the youngest villagers of Tuanul.",
