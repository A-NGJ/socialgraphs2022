His family was also assisted by the Mynock, piloted by Cade Skywalker, Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.\nFour days later, Skeeto and his family were enjoying a day in the pool, playing ball with Jariah Syn. His family later watched the holonews about the Massacre on Mon Calamari. It was then that Cade revealed that he was a Skywalker. Afterward, Skeeto and his family, except his father, moved to Kiffu.",
