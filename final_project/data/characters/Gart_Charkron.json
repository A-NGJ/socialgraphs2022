 "content": "Gart Charkron was a Human male who worked for the Imperial Reclamation Service during the Galactic War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.\nAround 3641 BBY, he was stationed on the prison world of Belsavis where he managed to uncover the existence of an ancient alien device but was not sure how it operated though knew it was extremely dangerous and was responsible for disintegrating three of his men. Furthermore, he believed some of the prisoners had inadvertently salvaged some of its core components that had been split into three parts. He tasked a Sith official with the recovery of the device and reassembling it.",
