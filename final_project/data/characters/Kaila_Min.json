 "content": "Kaila Min was a Human female who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Kaila Min frequented Narmle's Gambling Hall on Naboo's moon of Rori. Around this time, Min worked for the Black Sun and became involved in the search for the missing pilot Cal Handro who was sought by the Galactic Empire, Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a private citizen named Tyla Jinn.\nThe Human female by the name of Kaila Min lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War, a major conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Around this time, she frequented the Gambling Hall in Narmle, a city on Naboo's swamp moon of Rori. After the Battle of Yavin, she worked for the Black Sun, one of the most powerful criminal syndicate in the galaxy. In 1 ABY, she became involved in the search for a missing freighter pilot, a man by the name of Cal Handro sought by the Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, and a friend of Handro named Tyla Jinn. Jinn, Imperial Lieutenant Jevan Monsul, and Alliance Officer Veega Madish each sought to learn the whereabouts of Handro who vanished after his ship crash-landed on Rori. The man was also wanted by the Black Sun because he was smuggling a mysterious new kind of spice.\nTyla Jinn, Jevan Monsul and Veega Madish each recruited spacers to investigate the location of Handro's crash site and some of them collected spice samples. However, the Black Sun leaders on Rori were not willing to let anybody discover the existence of that spice. They therefore set up a trap for the spacers in order to retrieve the spice.\nKaila Min contacted Tyla Jinn, Jevan Monsul and Veega Madish and claimed she witnessed the missing pilot wandering through the wilderness of Rori. Pretending wishing to aid in Handro's rescue, Min reached out to at least one of the affected parties. In turn, they sent subordinates to travel to Rori to meet with Min to gain specific information on Handro's last known whereabouts. The spacers tasked with this responsibility met Min in Narmle's Gambling Hall, which also doubled as one of Narmle's two major hotels. After greeting the spacers, whom she was expecting, Kaila Min provided directions to where she pretended having seen Handro, including exact coordinates which she uploaded to the spacers' datapad. According to Min, she last witnessed Handro directly northeast of Narmle, north of some ruins and west of a statue head.\nUnbeknownst to the spacers however, was that the area was being surveilled by multiple members of the Black Sun crime syndicate. When the spacers embarked to investigate the location provided by Min, these Black Sun initiates, smugglers and minions violently ambushed the spacers. However, they were all defeated by the spacers' superior combat prowess. After killing the band of criminals, the spacers recovered one of their datapad's which provided the location of a Black Sun bunker in the Vaydean Marsh region of Rori. The spacers ventured toward this base, with the intention of discovering further clues surrounding Cal Handro's whereabouts. The spacers eventually discovered that the Black Sun did not know anything about the pilot and was just interested by the spice.\nKaila Min had dark skin, red-brown hair, and brown colored eyes. She had a kind, helpful demeanor, as evidenced by her willingness to aid in the search for Cal Handro and in her interactions with the random passers by of Narmle. However, when it came to aiding the Galactic Empire, she expected financial compensation, unlike her dealings with the Rebel Alliance, whom she would be willing to assist out of a cautious altruism. This suggests she had some sympathy for the Rebellion, but she was never willing to be seen talking to a Rebel, or even contact one directly, out of fear of being associated with an organization considered to be terrorists by much of the galaxy. Min also expressed concern for the average citizens of the galaxy, which displayed itself in her unwillingness to let someone carry out a dangerous task. During her stay on Rori, she enjoyed frequenting Narmle's Gambling Hall, which played host to an alcohol bar, and gambling machines in the form of lugjack and jubilee.\nDuring one of her visits to Narmle's Gambling Hall, Min wore black dress shoes and a luxurious gown similar to the one worn by Padmé Amidala during her time with Anakin Skywalker in Varykino during 22 BBY. However, unlike the darker gown worn by Padmé, Kaila Min's consisted of a light gray skirt and neck piece, and a darker shade of grey for the gown's corset and arm covers. She also possessed a dark grey shawl coat with red trimming, and at least one type of pistol.\nKaila Min was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. She was added to the game as part of the second chapter of the Secrets of the Syren\" story arc in a quest titled \"More Than You Bargained For\" during Publish 14.1 on March 24, 2005.\nThe quest included three different branches for Imperial, Rebel, and neutral players. While the general quest structure for each of these three options were virtually identical, there were minor variations in dialogue and in who started the quest. For instance, Jevan Monsul initiated the Imperial version of this quest, while Veega Madish and Tyla Jinn initiated the Rebel and neutral versions respectively. If the Imperial version was pursued, Kaila Min would reach out to Jevan Monsul with information about Cal Handro's whereabouts, but expect financial compensation. If the Rebel version were pursued, Min would secretly reach out to Veega Madish. Likewise, Min would reach out to Tyla Jinn, for players who were neither aligned with the Empire or Rebellion. This article leaves it ambiguous as to which of the three parties Kaila Min reached out to, or if she indeed reached out to all of them. Eventually, the Secrets of the Syren story arc was deactivated with the \"Chapter 1\", published on June 8, 2006, due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the Battle of Restuss.\nIn the Threat of the Conqueror expansion for the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game released on March 16, 2010, Kaila Min received an illustration in a quest card titled More Than You Bargained For. The card description erroneously referred to her as Kalla Min.",
