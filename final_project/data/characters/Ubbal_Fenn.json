 "content": "Ubbal Fenn was a female Human lieutenant of the technology-hating Meatlump gang who lived on Corellia at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Fenn was with a group of Meatlumps that were based in a cave near the city of Tyrena from where they carried out their missions to destroy all electronics on the planet. When the Meatlumps attacked the starship captain Osto Grissom, In 1 ABY, Major Walden of the Corellian Security Force asked an independent agent to investigate the attack. The agent tracked the Meatlumps to their cave and tried to make Fenn talk. When she refused, the agent destroyed most of their supplies and defeated several Meatlumps to convince her. Fenn finally admitted that they had attacked Grissom because he transported electronics into and out of the Corellian system. The agent was satisfied and didn't harm her.\nUbbal Fenn was a Non-Player Character in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ubbal Fenn was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006. She could be found inside the Meatlump Cave near Tyrena on Corellia and was part of the quest \"CorSec Case Files: Assault and Battery\", which was a part of the Legacy quest, the longest quest line of the game. The players had to talk to her, then destroy several supply crates by clicking on them and also had to kill 15 Meatlumps. At this point, Fenn revealed the reason for the attack and the player could return to Major Walden.\nDuring the conversation with Fenn, she mentioned the King of the Meatlumps. This was only the second mention of this being in the game after Vani Korr's first newspaper article. The Meatlump King became a popular urban legend among players on the official forums who played pranks on new players, telling them to go and find the Meatlump King. It wasn't until Chapter 10 in June 2008 that the King actually appeared in person.",
