 "content": "Amleto was an Elomin female spy who worked during the war between the First Order and the Resistance. She was present on the planet Varkana, and encountered the Resistance spies Norath Kev and Kazuda Xiono, who were attempting to avoid being captured by the First Order.\nAmleto had red skin and orange eyes. She wore a light-colored tunic and a belt over brown pants. Amleto also wore a mask over the lower half of her face, and a brown band on her right arm.\nAmleto was created for the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Breakout,\" which aired on December 29, 2019. The character was fully designed, but eventually cut from the final version of the episode, and her key moment was given to the market vendor Darrb of the planet Varkana. Amleto was mentioned in a \"Bucket's List\" article published on StarWars.com, and concept art of the character was shown in the accompanying video on YouTube.",
