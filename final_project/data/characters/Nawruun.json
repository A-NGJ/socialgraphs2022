 "content": "Nawruun was an elderly male Wookiee of the Nysshyyyk clan from Kashyyyk.\nNawruun was enslaved by the Empire and taken to the Maw Installation where he was forced to work alongside other Wookiees. To keep them in line, the Imperial overseer there had to continuously beat them into submission. When Chewbacca and the New Republic—led by Wedge Antilles—arrived to capture the Installation in 11 ABY, Nawruun took the Keeper's force whip and jammed it down the man's throat, killing him instantly.\nHe later served as a gunner during the Battle of the Maw Installation aboard one of the Imperial shuttles used by the New Republic to battle the Gorgon when it arrived to take back the Maw Installation.",
