 "content": "Olum was a Chief engineer in the Imperial military during the Galactic Civil War. He served aboard Blackguard, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer commanded by Grand Admiral Andal Sait. He was involved in the schemes of a Rodian smuggler Ubis Reendorr.\nAt some point Olum was contacted by Reendorr, who needed to smuggle a Rebel agent aboard Blackguard. Olum found the Rebel, smuggled aboard inside a cargo container with a shipment of bacta, and provided him with Imperial uniforms and a datapad with the ship's layout. The Rebel got himself into a firefight with Imperials, but was able to get what he came for. Olum covered his escape by pointing him the way to a nearby shuttle and adjusting the ship's transponder, which allowed the agent to escape the Star Destroyer.\nChief Engineer Olum was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Olum was added to the game as part of the \"Star Destroyer\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 8\" update, on November 1, 2007.",
