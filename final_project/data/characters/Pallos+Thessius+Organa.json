 "content": "Pallos Thessius Organa was a Human male who was the first nephew of the Great Duke Organa and a loyal individual of the Galactic Republic during the Cold War.\nDuring the Alderaan Civil War, Pallos was very loyal to House Organa and held a grudge against House Thul after the Treaty of Coruscant. In 3643 BBY, Pallos met the new Havoc Squad Lieutenant who saved Castle Organa from an Imperial missile that was nearly launched by Gearbox. He discovered that Markus Thul had made a deal to provide information and save his family. Pallos didn't agree to this since he was angry that Markus attempted to murder Duke Charle. He demanded to know what Havoc's mission was, but the CO refused to say, saying it's classified. Pallos was insulted that an ally would not trust him.\nAfter the Havoc CO rescue Markus' wife and daughter from House Thul and thwarted Gearbox, Pallos was concerned and disappointed that the Lieutenant made a deal with Markus, as well as turn a prison cell into a hotel. He declared that Markus would still pay for his assassination attempt. However, the Havoc CO announced that Markus and his family will be released for his assistance in Havoc Squad's mission. Pallos complained to Havoc's superior officer, General Â­Elin Garza, who made the CO promise to avoid disaffecting an ally again.\nPallos Thessius Organa is voiced by Daran Norris.",
