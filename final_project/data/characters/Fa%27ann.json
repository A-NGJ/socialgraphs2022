 "content": "Fa'ann was a male Sith Pureblood who was a Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. He was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock.\nFa'ann first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Centurion PvP Gear vendor for the Sith Warrior class. He was later removed during a restructuring of the game's PvP gear system, but was later reused as a vendor for the 2014 Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
