 "content": "Ashpidar was the commander of the Esfandia Long-Range Communications Base during the Yuuzhan Vong War. A Gotal female from Antar 4, she was once engaged to a commercial entrepreneur, with whom she intended to raise a family. However, he was killed in a mining accident. Devastated, she left Antar 4, and had not been back in twenty years. During the Battle of Esfandia, Commander Ashpidar was attacked by Tegg, an Ugnaught Peace Brigader at the facility, who tied electrical wires to her cones. Nevertheless, Ashpidar managed to survive the attack.",
