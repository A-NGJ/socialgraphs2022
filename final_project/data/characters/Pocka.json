 "content": "Pocka was a Quarren who worked for the company Skydove Freight during the era of the New Republic, as the pilot of the freighter Golden Opportunity.\nIn the role-playing adventure Tempest Feud, it was possible for Pocka to transport the player characters to the moon Nar Shaddaa, so that they could attend a party in the penthouse of the Hutt Popara, if the players lacked a starship of their own. However, the novel Scourge established the canon series of events from the Tempest Feud storyline and established that the Jedi archivist Mander Zuma and the spacers Reen Irana and Eddey Be'ray—who fulfill the role of the Tempest Feud player characters—traveled to Nar Shaddaa on the freighter New Ambition, thus rendering Pocka's transportation of the player characters non-canon.",
