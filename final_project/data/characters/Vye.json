 "content": "Vye was a Human female Corellian who was the sister of Vorr and Vexx. She was killed by the future Grand Champion of the Great Hunt on Balmorra.\nTrying to get his competitor killed, Tarro Blood convinced Vye and her brother, Vorr, that the bounty hunter who killed Vexx shot him in the back and then murdered Braden. Along with Vorr, Vye confronted the hunter in the Sobrik spaceport. In the ensuing firefight, the hunter proved better with a blaster and killed the siblings.\nVye first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. She appears on the planet Balmorra just after the bounty hunter lands. The player also has the \"light side\" option of convincing the two of Tarro's deception. If this option is taken, Vye is reluctant to believe the hunter's story, but ultimately leaves when Vorr does. This article assumes the player chose the first \"dark side\" option.",
