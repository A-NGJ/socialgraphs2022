 "content": "Jira was a human female from Tatooine. At the time of the Naboo Crisis, the elderly Jira sold fruits, such as pallies, in the Mos Espa marketplace. She was a friend of Anakin Skywalker, then a nine-year-old slave boy.\nIn the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Jira lived on the desert planet of Tatooine, in the Outer Rim Territories. At the time of the Naboo Crisis, she ran a small stand in the market place of Mos Espa, where she sold various food products, including pallies. Jira was a friend to Anakin Skywalker, then a nine-year-old slave boy. When the elderly woman expressed her need for a cooling unit, Skywalker offered to search for one on her behalf. When her young friend Skywalker met the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Jira sold them a few pallies. Feeling in her old bones that a sandstorm was about to occur, she advised Skywalker to get home as soon as possible. A few days later, Jira's young friend left Tatooine with Qui-Gon Jinn.\nJira was a green-eyed human female. In her old age, she tied up her gray hair into loose braids. Despite her poverty, Jira was still a jovial and very kind woman. She was very fond of her young friend Anakin Skywalker, who she called \"the kindest boy in the galaxy.\"",
