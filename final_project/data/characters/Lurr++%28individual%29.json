She recorded at least one hologram about the fate of the Outcasts following their exodus to the Promised Land, which was discovered by a Republic-identified individual on Taris. Lurr felt that the \"Promised Land\" was an inaccurate name for the place in which she lived.\nLurr was created for the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, appearing in the Taris general mission \"Chasing History.\"",
