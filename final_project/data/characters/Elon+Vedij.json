 "content": "Elon Vedij was Human male TIE pilot from the Imperial Navy, who was the younger brother of Dhas Fenoep Vedij and the son of Baron Admiral Ronnan Tyla Vedij. In 0 BBY he was posted to the same ship as his brother, who was serving as executive officer on board the Far Orbit. Dhas suspected this was to make the removal of the Vedij family, whose loyalty to the Galactic Empire was apparently suspect, easier.\nIn any case, Elon died in combat with the Silent Blades pirates after Captain Vocis Kenit ordered all of his TIE/LN starfighters to attack them in their asteroid lair. This wanton waste of sentient life convinced Dhas, his brother, to plan a mutiny.",
