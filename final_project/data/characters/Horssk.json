 "content": "Horssk was a Trandoshan male who was a member of the Cell, a group trying to oust Nirama from control of the Cularin system's crime in 31 BBY.\nThis was a name on a list of Cell members that the Gamemaster could assign whatever role and skills necessary to challenge the players when the Cell tested the skills they claimed they were good at. This character's skill would depend on those of the player characters and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Horssk would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by the Cell because the player character could recognize Horssk's name as a Cell member.",
