 "content": "Valdos Dofine was a male Twi'lek slave master operating on Zakuul, who provided slaves as fodder for the Arena Pit fighting business. In 3631 BBY, he made a wager with Bowdaar, owner of the Platform 6 cantina. Bowdaar and his champion would fight in a private match and receive Dofine's entire slave stock if they win, but Bowdaar himself would become Dofine's slave should he lose. Bowdaar and the Alliance Commander faced against Kordath, Calo Arawan and Veran Anjek and emerged victorious, causing Dofine's to complete his part of the deal despite his claims that the fight was rigged.\nValdos Dofine appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during Bowdaar Alliance alert mission.",
