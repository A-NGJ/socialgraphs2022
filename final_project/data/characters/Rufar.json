 "content": "Rufar was a Human male lieutenant who served the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3640 BBY, Rufar fought in the Battle of Corellia against Imperial forces. After the Republic, under General Aves' command, was able to take Axial Park, Rufar led his unit to reclaim the Cross of Glory Walk, a memorial path in the Leisure Garden that honored the heroes of the Jedi Civil War. However, he and his unit were ambushed by Mandalorian rocket-troopers that were deployed by the Empire and struck a blow on the Republic's morale. Wounded, Rufar was send to recuperate to the nearest Republic base of operations, from which he convinced a Republic hero to finish his mission and restore the morale.",
