 "content": "Benedict Vidkun was a married engineer working in the sewers on Coruscant in Imperial City.\nVidkun worked as an engineer at the Imperial Complex. Most of Vidkun's low salary was spent on expensive items by his younger wife. His two brothers-in-law were Lair and Daiv. He was a contact of Dash Rendar who accompanied Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to rescue Leia Organa from Prince Xizor. They paid for the information and the plans for the sewers that lead to Xizor's Palace and hired him to open the grates and the zapping failsafe mechanism. For some reason they didn't trust Vidkun and did not allow him to call his wife before leaving, nor to hold a blaster in the sewers, fearing that he would give them in.\nHe led the band via the sewers until outside the Palace's recycling room. He left them a key and started to leave but Lando insisted that he would come along and wait for them. After a brief argument, Vidkun pulled off his hidden blaster and shot Dash whom he injured, but Dash shot him between the eyes immediately after.\nVidkun was a Human male with bulging brown eyes, a larger nose, a wispy beard and mustache, sharp yellow teeth, and often cleared his throat.\nThe Shadows of the Empire novel, comic and sourcebook describe and show Vidkun as a thin and short goblin-like figure. The Topps Shadows of the Empire trading cards by Greg and Tim Hildebrandt depict Rendar shooting Vidkun. There, Vidkun is seen from the rear, however he obviously appears as a normal medium-statured and well-built man.",
