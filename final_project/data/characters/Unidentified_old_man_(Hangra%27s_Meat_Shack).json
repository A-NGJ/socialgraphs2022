 "content": "An elderly human man operated the grill on a stall known as Hangra's Meat Shack on Level 2142 of the planet Coruscant shortly after the destruction of the planet Alderaan. While he ran the stall, an Alderaanian fugitive named Anandra Milon approached him and asked about a shipment from Centax 3. Not knowing what she was talking about he gave her a look of confused condescension, but eventually took pity on her and gave her a small amount of food.\nThe old man first appeared in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 in 2014.",
