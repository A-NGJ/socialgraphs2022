 "content": "Lela Hue was a female Human daughter of Danbar Hue living on Tatooine during the Cold War. In 3643 BBY the Twin Suns pirates raided several moisture farms near Anchorhead and took females as prisoners, to be shipped as slaves off-world. However, Danbar Hue hired a Republic citizen to stop the pirates and liberate the captives and as a result all prisoners, including Lela, were able to return to their homes safely.\nLela Hue appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the heroic mission \"Search and Rescue\" on Tatooine.",
