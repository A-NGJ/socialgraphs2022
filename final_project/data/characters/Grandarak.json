 "content": "\"Lefty\" Grandarak was a male Arcona smuggler who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. While on the Republic capital world of Coruscant, he was stationed in the Senate Tower's Commercial District, where he would spend his time at Mariyk's cantina.\n\"Lefty\" Grandarak appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as the Advanced Class trainer for the Smuggler class. He was removed in Game Update 5.0, when advanced classes were made available on character creation rather than level 10.",
