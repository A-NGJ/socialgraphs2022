 "content": "Mavin was a Human male member of the Five, a reclusive evil-worshipping cult that lived within the mysterious region of space known as the Hellhoop. Mavin and his compatriots spent centuries torturing and killing unfortunate travelersâ€”notably, they imprisoned Wutzek, the last known surviving Force demon in the galaxy. Sometime between 0 and 3 ABY, the Five captured Rebel leaders Leia Organa, Chewbacca and Han Solo, along with a group of Torgaigne gangsters from nearby Attahox. Mavin, a bloodthirsty killer, used a weapon called a black fireclaw to brutally kill the Torgaigne, before the Five proceeded to psychologically torment Organa and Solo. However, Chewbacca freed Wutzek before the Five could kill his friends, and the unleashed demon utterly destroyed Mavin and his fellows.\nMavin appeared in The Pandora Effect, a 1981 comic story written by Alan Moore and published in The Empire Strikes Back Monthly 151. In the story, Mavin was drawn by Adolfo Buylla.",
