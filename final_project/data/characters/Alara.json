 "content": "Alara was a Human female member of the Jedi Order during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. She was present at the Jedi Temple on the Republic capital of Coruscant in 3653 BBY, when the Empire launched a surprise attack on the planet. When the Sith Lord Darth Malgus infiltrated and assaulted the Temple with a strike team of fifty other Sith, Alara joined her fellow Jedi in the defense of their home; she attacked Malgus alongside two of her comrades, but was quickly defeatedâ€”the Sith Lord severed Alara's lightsaber-wielding hand and throttled her with his own hand before slamming her into the Temple floor with Force-enhanced strength, killing her. Malgus's forces were victorious in the battle, slaughtering Alara's Jedi brethren before destroying the Temple as a whole in what would prove to be the final battle of the war.\nAlara was first introduced in The Old Republic: Deceived, a novel written by Paul S. Kemp and released in March 2011. Chapter 2, which features Malgus's attack and Alara's death, was released on December 16, 2010, as an excerpt published on StarWars.com.",
