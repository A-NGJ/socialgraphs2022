 "content": "Veeboo Lunx was a male Rodian bounty hunter who was a competitor in the Great Hunt in 3643 BBY. On the planet Tatooine, Lunx was tasked with tracking down the Devaronian conman Gault Rennow, and Lunx successfully shot down Lokai's ship over the Dune Sea. However, Lokai bribed Lunx to drop out of the Hunt, giving the Rodian more credits than he would have received in the competition, and also offered him a bounty on Lunx's rival in the search for Lokai. Lunx began to party in the cantina in Outpost Varath, but his rival tracked him down and confronted him about dropping out. Lunx turned on the hunter with several hired thugs, but was ultimately killed in the firefight.",
