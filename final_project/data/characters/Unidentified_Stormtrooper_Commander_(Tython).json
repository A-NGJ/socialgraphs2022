 "content": "A human male Stormtrooper Commander served in a Galactic Empire remnant led by Moff Gideon. In 9 ABY, the commander and his unit were dispatched by Gideon to the planet Tython to capture the Force-sensitive infant Grogu. The trooper pushed his comrades to advance up the slope and against two enemies, the bounty hunter Boba Fett and assassin Fennec Shand, and continued to fire on the opponents. However, the Stormtrooper Commander was killed by Fett when the bounty hunter flanked and impaled the commander with a gaderffii stick.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, the Stormtrooper Commander served in a remnant of the Galactic Empire led by Moff Gideon. In 9 ABY, the trooper traveled aboard Gideon's light cruiser, which tracked the gunship Razor Crest to the planet Tython in search of the Force-sensitive infant Grogu. The Stormtrooper Commander was deployed by Gideon to the surface on an Imperial transport, leading a unit in search of Grogu. After the dropship landed next to the Razor Crest and the stormtroopers exited, proceeding toward the child's location. However, they immediately came under fire from the bounty hunter Boba Fett and assassin Fennec Shand, positioned up a hill slope, who killed several of them before the Stormtrooper Commander ordered them move up the slope after the two.\nThe commander's squad fired on the two enemies with their E-11 medium blaster rifles and the trooper told one of the unit to flank them from above to their left. The other stormtrooper replied that there was too much fire right before being shot and killed, prompting the commander to order the rest of the troopers to continue up the slope. As stormtrooper reinforcements deployed from the dropship, the troopers continued to fire up the hill slope, taking further losses from Shand. An E-Web turret and an Artillery stormtrooper attempted to kill the assassin, but she pushed a large boulder out of place, which crushed several stormtroopers and the E-Web emplacement before landing near the Stormtrooper Commander.\nThe commander prompted the other stormtroopers to keep advancing before Fett, having crept up from behind, tapped the trooper on the shoulder with his gaderffii stick. The stormtrooper attempted to raise his blaster, but the bounty hunter knocked the rifle from the trooper's hands, taking down the commander. After eliminating three more stormtroopers with his weapon, Fett walked to the Stormtrooper Commander and grabbed the trooper by the throat, throwing the commander to the ground and impaling the trooper's chest armor. The rest of the stormtroopers soon retreated despite another Imperial transport arriving, and Fett destroyed both dropships upon their ascent. Gideon's cruiser, though, destroyed the Razor Crest and his dark troopers were able to apprehend Grogu and escape.\nA human male, the Stormtrooper Commander repeatedly told the trooper's subordinates to advance on the enemy, calling one of them an idiot when the other trooper argued that there was too much fire.\nThe Stormtrooper Commander wore the standard armor of an Imperial stormtrooper with an orange pauldron to signify the trooper's rank and a military backpack. The commander used an E-11 blaster rifle in combat.\nThe Stormtrooper Commander appeared in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Robert Rodriguez and released on December 4, 2020. Although not named, the trooper was credited as \"Stormtrooper 2\" in the subtitles, and played by an uncredited extra.",
