 "content": "Arathab Fal was a Tarnab male who was a wanted murderer during the High Republic Era. Fal acted as the agent of an individual who claimed to be the upper ranks of the Nihil marauder organization, wishing to sell a weapon. On the planet Coruscant, Fal met with the criminal Urk Panga and Keefar Branto, a reformed criminal and undercover Galactic Republic operative. When the detective Sian Holt followed Branto to investigate why he was associating with criminals, Fal emerged from the shadows and attacked them, shooting Panga dead. Branto and Holt attempted to flee, but the Tarnab also killed the former. Holt was knocked down, and though she managed to reach for her blaster and fire back at Fal before falling unconscious, the Tarnab escaped, moving on to Vorzyd V, where he once again attempted to sell the item.",
