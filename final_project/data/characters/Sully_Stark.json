 "content": "Sully Stark was a human female dissident of an underground movement that helped smuggle surviving Jedi to safety.\nSully Stark joined the Path sometime after the rise of the Galactic Empire to help rescue and smuggle Jedi who survived Order 66. While Obi-Wan Kenobi was still healing from his battle against Darth Vader, she and Wade Resselian were discussing on a plan to infiltrate the Inquisitorius fortress on Nur to rescue Leia Organa, though she admitted she did not know what the inside of the fortress was like. When Kenobi came out of the bacta tank, he proposed using the T-47 airspeeders, but Sully dismissed using the idea, as they were only used for hauling sewage, as they were not soldiers. Sully said that Kenobi was not fit enough to come on the rescue mission, as he was still recovering, but Kenobi insisted. Tala Durith let him accompany them on the mission, using her Imperial clearance to get inside the fortress.\nSully later piloted one of two T-47 airspeeders sent to help clear the platform and allow Kenobi, Durith, and Organa evacuate the fortress. She then witnessed Wade's airspeeder get destroyed by the Third Sister, which devastated her.\nSully Stark was portrayed by actress Maya Erskine, first appearing in \"Part IV\" in Obi-Wan Kenobi. The character's surname was provided in the credits for \"Part V.\"",
