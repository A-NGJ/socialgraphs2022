 "content": "Ceryss was a male Miraluka who was a member of the Jedi Order and served as commander for the Republic Military during the Galactic War with the Sith Empire. He was one of the commanders during the Korriban Incursion, and was slain by Imperial forces.\nCommander Ceryss appears as one of the four Republic commanders that must be killed in the Imperial version of the Tactical Flashpoint \"Assault on Tython,\" which was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel in Game Update 2.7: Invasion. For Republic players, Ceryss is replaced by Commander Vang, and the two share many of their game mechanics.",
