 "content": "Sard Nightbringer was the most powerful crime lord of the Tamarin sector during the Galactic Civil War. During the last years of the Empire, she struggled mightily against the bureaucracy of the Empire. Following the Battle of Endor, she and her forces began taking back their sector, invading Imperial positions and removing the forces which controlled them. Her forces obtained a prototype set of combat armor from Imperial Research and Development Station T-1583, which she tried to auction off to obtain funds for her organization. After Natja the Hutt was killed following her winning bid, Marg Sonat killed Nightbringer in order to take possession of the combat armor for himself.",
