 "content": "Ishtah was a male Kaleesh technician who worked in Paolo's Chop Shop on Nar Shaddaa in 19 BBY. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi visited this shop shortly after the end of the Clone Wars to sell his starfighter, Soulless One. Ishtah's menacing stare reminded Obi-Wan of the vessel's previous owner, General Grievous. The Kaleesh didn't trust the newcomer for some reason, but he nevertheless informed the owner of the shop, Zegundis, of his arrival. Kenobi eventually managed to sell his starfighter after a heated bargaining with Zegundis, who was also wary of her client as she trusted Ishtah's judgement.",
