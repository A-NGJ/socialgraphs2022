 "content": "Lord Aziel was a Falleen male who served under the Black Sun vigo Qazadi during the reign of the Galactic Empire. During 0 ABY, Aziel accompanied Qazadi on a trip to the planet Wukkar on a mission to inspect the blackmail files of Black Sun leader Prince Xizor, which were held on the world by Black Sun Sector Chief Avrak Villachor. During the visit, Aziel stayed in a suite at the luxury Lulina Crown Hotel in Iltarr City, where he held custody of the galaxy's last remaining cryodex, an encryption device that could be used to read Xizor's files. Aziel was later arrested by Imperial forces dispatched from the Star Destroyer Dominator, though the Imperials were ultimately forced to let him go.",
