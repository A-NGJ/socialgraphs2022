 "content": "Tikkes was a male Quarren senator who represented his homeworld Mon Calamari in the Galactic Republic's Senate around the time of the Invasion of Naboo. He had been a businessman before joining the Senate and only became a senator to increase his own fortunes. Despite supporting the Military Creation Act, he defected to the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Separatist Crisis, being replaced in the Republic Senate by the Quarren loyalist Tundra Dowmeia. In the Confederacy, he represented various groups, including the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps and Pammant Docks.\nDespite being given a senior position on the council and regularly attending their meetings on Geonosis before the Clone Wars, Tikkes was never truly a major member of the council and mainly focused his attention on trying to bring Mon Cala into the Separatist fold. During the war, Tikkes advised the Battle of Mon Cala, a failed Separatist takeover of the planet in 20 BBY. At the end of the war in 19 BBY, Tikkes and the rest of the Separatist Council were slaughtered by Darth Vader on the volcanic Outer Rim world Mustafar.\nIn the rough draft of the script of Attack of the Clones, Tikkes' name was Tessek. During production of Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith the same costume was used for both Tikkes and the Republic Senator Tundra Dowmeia. He was played by an uncredited extra.\nDuring production of the episodes from the Mon Calamari arc of the fourth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, concept art of Tikkes was created but went unused.\nOn May 30, 2012, Supervising Director Dave Filoni posted an update about Tikkes on his official Facebook account. This post was in response to a fan question in a chat on EW.com during the Season Four finale episode \"Revenge\". The post details why Tikkes did not fit and was removed from the final scripts for the Mon Calamari arc of episodes.\nIn March 2014, Filoni posted an entry on the Official Star Wars Blog that was meant to show gratitude to the fans for supporting the series before its cancellation. The entry featured sketches by Filoni himself that were meant for the unproduced seventh season of the show and were drawn during one of the last The Clone Wars writer's conferences. One of the drawings featured several of the show's heroes meeting with a group of Quarren in an unknown city above water. Filoni wrote a caption \"Meeting with Tikkes on Quarren City\" under the sketch.",
