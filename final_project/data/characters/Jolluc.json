 "content": "Jolluc was a male Human Maujasi leader that led the Mauja clans in raiding Galactic Republic supplies en route to Hadde during the Clone Wars.\nOmega Squad was sent to the planet Haurgab to assassinate him. During a particular raid on a Galactic Republic convoy, Jolluc led the assault and he was shot in the head by Corr. Atin shot him again as a precaution.\nHe was described as a balding man in his fifties. He wore several pieces of trooper armor which he presumably took from dead clone troopers.",
