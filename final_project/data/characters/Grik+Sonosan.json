 "content": "Grik Sonosan was a Human male Agent of the Republic Strategic Information Service who served as a spy for the Galactic Republic during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Grik was carrying information about Nomen Karr and his padawan Jaesa Willsaam that he kept secret until he was captured by the Sith Empire and frozen in carbonite. interrogated by Sith Lord Darth Baras on Dromund Kaas. To Baras' frustration, Grik refused to crack, as if some unknown power was shielding his mind. After sending his apprentice into the Dark Temple to retrieve an ancient torture and interrogation device known as the Ravager, Baras used it to finally break Grik's resistance.\nUnder the Ravager's influence, Grik confirmed he was an Republic Strategic Information Service agent investigating a suspected Imperial spy on Nar Shaddaa on behalf of Jedi Master Nomen Karr. Baras was incensed by knowing that his old nemesis was out to prove that the Empire had spies in the Republic and Jedi ranks and demanded to know what had alerted Karr. Grik explained that Karr was training a Padawan with the unique ability to discern one's true nature with a glance. Karr believed his Padawan's ability to be foolproof, but the Jedi Council remained skeptical, so Karr took the spy-hunting into his own hands. Grik was to provide the proof but was captured before being able to do so.\nKnowing that even with this bit of relief, the Padawan was still a threat, Baras demanded Grik to tell him everything he knew about her. Grik stated that the Padawan was from Alderaan and trained on Tatooine and that Jedi had sent an investigator to root out a suspected spy on Balmorra. But before he could give anything more, the Ravager liquefied his mind, killing him.",
