 "content": "Ransley was a Human male and Captain in the Imperial Navy. He commanded the Acclamator-class assault ship Harvester.\nIn 19 BBY, the Harvester intercepted the starship of Dezono Qua by the desert world of Prine. However, Qua's ship was being flown by wanted Jedi fugitive Dass Jennir, after having killed the vessel's former owner. When Jennir refused to stand by and be boarded and instead attempted to make for the planet, Ransley gave the order for two Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters to destroy Jennir's ship.\nWhile the V-wings were successful in bringing the civilian ship down, Jennir managed to trick the two fighters into colliding, destroying them. Despite the survival of both the Jedi and his companion in the crash, Ransley subsequently reported that the ship was destroyed to preserve the possibility of advancement through the ranks, a detail capitalized on by Beyghor Sahdett, who had downloaded Ransley's reports in attempt at finding Jennir.",
