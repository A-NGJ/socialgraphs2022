 "content": "Raz was a short-tempered Duros band leader for the group Raz and the Ubo-Kings. Raz and his band initially played on Nar Shaddaa, but Raz always felt that his talents were wasted playing as background music for the planet's underworld deals and barroom brawls. Eventually, Raz and his band would achieve stardom in Zakuul.\nRaz is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne in the codex entry for Raz and the Ubo-Kings.",
