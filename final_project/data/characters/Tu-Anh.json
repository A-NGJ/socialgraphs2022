 "content": "Tu-Anh was a female Jedi Master who lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic. She perished on Utapau toward the end of the Clone Wars while investigating a Separatist conspiracy. Her body was discovered by the locals and shown to Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nTu-Anh was promoted to the Jedi Order towards the end of the Galactic Republic and at one point earned the rank of Jedi Master.\nWhile negotiations were taking place between the Separatists and Sugi in Pau City, the maverick Jedi Knight Tu-Anh began investigating the deal, without informing either the Jedi Order or the planet's natives what her purpose there was. During Tu-Anh's mission she was killed while spying on a meeting between a Sugi and several IG-100 MagnaGuards, prompting June to contact the Order so they could collect their fallen comrade's body. The inspector personally greeted Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker when they landed in Pau City, and led them to the morgue where Tu-Anh was being kept while questioning them about why she had been on Utapau. After her body was examined, the body was cremated with a small ceremony.\nThe corpse of Tu-Anh first appeared in the unfinished Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode titled \"A Death on Utapau.\"",
