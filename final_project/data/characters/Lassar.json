 "content": "\"Lassar,\" nicknamed \"Jogan\" after the fruit of the same name, was a veteran clone trooper who fought in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. After the\nRepublic became the Galactic Empire, the clone soldiers were ultimately decommissioned and replaced by enlisted stormtroopers. Although he resented that situation, Lassar nevertheless became an instructor at the Imperial Academy of Eriadu.\nWhen the son of a farmer joined the Academy, Lassar took an instant dislike for him. He mocked the new cadet's size, which was shorter than average, and ordered the other recruits to punch him in the sides every morning.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, Lassar stood at a height of 1.83 meters. He regarded enlisted soldiers as flawed, lesser beings, and he encouraged abuse among cadets.",
