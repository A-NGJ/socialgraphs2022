 "content": "Sir Mac was a Bith who, in 22 BBY, visited the Outlander Club and the the streets of the Uscru Entertainment District on Coruscant when Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were pursuing the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. He witnessed Anakin's fall from Zam's Koro-2 all-environment exodrive airspeeder and watched as he regained himself and continued pursuing Zam. While so, the Bith stroked his chin, most likely a gesture of confusion. While in the Outlander Club and on the streets of Coruscant, the Bith wore a cheap suit of a greenish tint. The Bith was also one of many Coruscant Citizens that were impoverished.",
