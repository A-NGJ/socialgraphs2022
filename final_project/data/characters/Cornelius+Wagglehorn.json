 "content": "Cornelius Wagglehorn was a male Human and a professor at Corellia University. In 1 ABY, he was present in Tyrena on Corellia, from where he hired a spacer through his assistant to find out what had happened at the Corellia University research outpost on Talus, with which he had lost contact. The spacer discovered that members of the Cult of Exar Kun had come and forcibly recruited the researchers and the students at the outpost, so Wagglehorn had the spacer infiltrate and destroy the cult.\nProfessor Cornelius Wagglehorn was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Cornelius Wagglehorn was added to the game along with the \"Exar Kun\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 9\" update, on April 3, 2008.",
