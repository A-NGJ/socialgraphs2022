 "content": "Asher Zavros was the supposed brother of Ashara Zavros, a Togruta Jedi–turned–Sith who was active during the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. While apprenticed to the Sith Lord Darth Nox, Ashara read a letter to her teacher that she claimed to be from her parents; the letter stated that a sixteen-year-old Asher planned to join the Republic Special Forces.\nHowever, the veracity of the letter was questionable, as Ashara's parents, the Jedi Knights Rolen and Yanila Zavros, died more than a decade prior, in the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY.\nAsher Zavros is mentioned by the conversation \"Fear and Longing\" with the Sith Inquisitor companion Ashara Zavros in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. However, the letter she reads to the player does not line up with Ashara's own backstory, as laid out in other conversations and the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia. Ashara herself states in the conversation \"Masters\" that her parents died in the Sacking of Coruscant, and she and the Encyclopedia say that she was adopted by the Jedi Masters Ryen and Ocera after her parents died. Thus, the validity of the letter's contents are suspect.",
