 "content": "A human female villager lived in a village on the Outer Rim Territories planet Carajam. Between 2 BBY and 4 ABY, her village was attacked by the bounty hunter Zingo Gabnit, who killed several villagers and tied up the survivors to lay a trap for his pursuer, the bounty hunter Boba Fett. By nighttime, Fett arrived at the village, and the female villager pleaded for his help.\nFrom a distance, Gabnit spoke to Fett via comlink, offering a reward for letting him live while promising to kill the villagers if they fought, which prompted the villager to ask for help again. Fett ran to fight Gabnit and ultimately killed him, at which point the villagers freed themselves. As Fett dragged his body away, the female thanked Fett. She had light skin, black hair, and brown eyes. She wore a brown coat over a gray tunic with a brown belt, as well as dark pants, boots, and a gray scarf.\nThe villager appeared in the one-shot comic Age of Rebellion - Boba Fett 1, published by Marvel Comics on May 8, 2019. The comic was written by Greg Pak and pencilled by Marc Laming.",
