At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Zukata came at the Rii Jenks Cantina on the planet Formos in order to find her brother Godon Netakka, a bounty hunter on the trail of the Aqualish smuggler Bandin Dobah. There, she encountered a group of off-world adventurers who had been hired to recover the droid R4-W9, which had been stolen by Dobah. They agreed to help her, to find his brother meaning to find the Aqualish.",
