 "content": "Fidaval was a male Devaronian who lived during the Galactic Civil War. He was the brother of Ratheb.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Fidaval and his brother Ratheb resided on board Tansarii Point Station, in the Bright Jewel system. During that time, Fidaval was a wanted man and even had a death mark on his head. In 1 ABY, the bounty hunter Boba Fett localized the two brothers to Tansarii Point Station. Meanwhile, Boba Fett was also training a spacer who wished to become a bounty hunter and realized that hunting Fidaval could be a good exercise. Fett therefore tasked the spacer to interrogate Ratheb about his brother. The former was indeed not willing to share any information about Fidaval but the spacer eventually forced him to reveal the location of his brother. The spacer then confronted Fidaval and his bodyguards in the atrium of the station and finally killed the wanted Devaronian.\nFidaval appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Fidaval was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
