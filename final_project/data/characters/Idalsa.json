 "content": "Idalsa was a Twi'lek female doctor who was active during the Galactic Civil War. Her unorthodox approach to \"industrial folk medicine\" allowed her to convert substances as diverse as fuel, carbonite, and toxic sludge into useful medications.\nIdalsa joined the Uprising against Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector following the Battle of Endor. She was active in the crew of a young smuggler and participated in numerous missions to undermine Adelhard's rule.\nIdalsa was created by Kabam for Star Wars: Uprising, a canon mobile video game for iOS and Android operating systems. She was one of many characters that the player could send on various \"crew run\" missions to collect useful items.",
