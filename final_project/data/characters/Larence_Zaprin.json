 "content": "Larence Zaprin was a human male who lived on Naboo with his family at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Larence Zaprin lived in his estate in the remote wilderness of the Gallo Mountains with his wife, his daughter Mia and his son Jowres.\nIn 1 ABY, a group of sick narglatchs and motts surrounded his home. When his children Mia and Jowres left the house, they were attacked and infected with an unknown illness. Zaprin sent an urgent request for a doctor to help his sick children. A short time later, a medic sent by the 2-1B droid Billingsly reached the Zaprin estate and managed to create an anti-toxin to cure the children. Zaprin didn't have enough money to pay the medic the full amount of credits, so he gave him a field surgeon pistol to cover the remainder of the cost.\nLarence Zaprin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Larence Zaprin was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nLarence Zaprin could be found in a remote building in the Nabooian mountains south-east of the Lake Retreat. He was part of the quest \"House Call\" for players of the Medic profession.",
