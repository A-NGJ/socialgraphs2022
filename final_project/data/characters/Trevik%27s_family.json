 "content": "The Quesoth males who resided in the planet Quethold's Red City, Jirvin and Trevik, were part of a family in 8 ABY. During the same year, Trevik became the reigning Queen of the Red's bowlcarrier, the highest honor a member of the Midli caste could achieve, carrying a bowl of nectar for her. The bowlcarrier's brother told the other to use a holocam provided by Empire of the Hand Grand Admiral Thrawn to record the artwork inside alien warlord Nuso Esva's quarters in the Dwelling of Guests building under the warlord's directive in an attempt to trick the admiral into attacking the city as the alien desired.\nTrevik complied, and did as ordered after hesitating, as he did not wish to damage his family's honor. Shortly after, a battle between Thrawn's stormtroopers and Esva's warriors—the Chosen—and the Quesoth Soldiers broken, with the warlord being killed after telling the bowlcarrier to tell Thrawn that although he was defeated, his warriors would kill the Chiss.\nThe family appeared in the 2011 novella Crisis of Faith, written by Timothy Zahn and included in Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition.",
