 "content": "Chief Technician Boz Addle was a Human male engineer working in the hangar bays of the Jedi Temple's mooring tower on Coruscant during the Clone Wars. His duty was to maintain the starships used by the Jedi Order, and he seems to have been a non-Force-sensitive specialist working for the Order, rather than a Jedi Knight himself.\nChief Boz was a skilled specialist, able to differentiate different types of damage by a quick visual inspection. Although he cared deeply for all the ships he tended, he was particularly fond of fast, streamlined couriers like the Seltaya-class.",
