 "content": "Captain Lin Nunsk was an Imperial Navy captain who had been assigned as the commander of the Tapani sector fleet, leading it from his flagship, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Gauntlet. He was stationed in the Tapani sector for six years prior to the Battle of Endor and was charged with safeguarding the Galactic Empire's bacta shipments as they made their runs through the Shapani Bypass. Nunsk was a competent officer, however he was prone to taking as few risks as possible and was regarded as overly cautious by his superiors, some of whom thought of him as cowardly.",
