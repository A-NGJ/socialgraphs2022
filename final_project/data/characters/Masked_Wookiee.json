The Wookiee was present when the cantina was attacked by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun, who was in disguise as the Zabrak Jedi Knight Nek Lawsirk. The next day, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who were investigating the incident, asked the Wookiee a few questions about what had happened.",
