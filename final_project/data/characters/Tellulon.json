 "content": "Tellulon was a male Human spy who served the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Tellulon worked under the orders of Colonel Verks and successfully infiltrated the Imperial armed forces. He was assigned to the Imperial Fortress on Yavin 4 where he served as a technician. During his time on Yavin 4, Tellulon worked with an Imperial assistant technician named Arlo.\nIn 1 ABY, during the Empire Day festivities, he met a group of Rebel spacers, sent to meet him from Coronet by a Rebel contact. Tellulon spoke with them about Arlo, who was having second thoughts about being part of the Empire. Tellulon suggested to the Rebels that they speak to Arlo. They did so and finally convinced the assistant technician to defect to the Alliance. Tellulon then instructed the Rebel spacers to seek out Colonel Verks at the Yavin Mining Outpost when their work was finished.\nTellulon appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tellulon was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. During the 2005 Empire Day live event from June 29 to July 11, 2005, he could be found in the Imperial Fortress and was part of a quest titled \"Empire Day Revealed,\" which would send players on an important mission throughout the galaxy. After the live event ended, Tellulon never reappeared in the game since the Empire Day event was discontinued until its complete overhaul in 2008.",
