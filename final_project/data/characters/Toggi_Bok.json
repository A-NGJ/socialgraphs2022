 "content": "Toggi Bok was a male Trandoshan who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. He was known to do business with Jabba the Hutt. Sometime following 0 BBY, Jabba's employee Dunir Signos tasked a spacer with delivering a package to Bok, who at the time was with several Trandoshans at a small camp just outside of Mos Eisley.\nToggi Bok appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Toggi Bok was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
