 "content": "In 3956 BBY, a Human female Jedi was present aboard the Star Forge. She served the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic during the Jedi Civil War against the Sith Empire. During the Battle of Rakata Prime, she and several other Jedi were sent aboard the Star Forge as a strike team.\nDuring the Old Sith Wars, a Human female served as a Jedi. The Jedi Order and Galactic Republic, whom she served, had been struggling against the forces of the Sith Empire, now under the command of Darth Malak, a fallen Jedi.\nIn 3956 BBY, three years after the beginning of the Jedi Civil War, Darth Revan, who's memory had been erased, was retrained by the Jedi. Alongside Padawan Bastila Shan, they discovered the location of the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan factory and space station and the secret of the Sith's overwhelming infrastructure. Bastila had been captured by Malak and seduced by the dark side during their mission. Upon arriving in the system where the Star Forge was located, Revan contacted the Republic, but a disruptor field based on the planet of Lehon incapacitated their ship, the Ebon Hawk. The crew of the Hawk destroyed the shield and confronted Shan, who fled to the station from the surface.\nWith the disruptor field now destroyed, a massive Republic assault fleet, under the command of Admiral Forn Dodonna and Jedi Master Vandar Tokare, jumped into the system. The fallen Bastila Shan, on the station, began using her renowned battle meditation against the Republic fleet. Now losing the battle and unable to attack, Tokare ordered several Jedi, including the Revan and the Human female, to board the station and defeat Bastila. Upon boarding, most of the Jedi went forward into the station. The human female and three other Jedi stayed behind in the hangar, waiting to assist Revan and the Ebon Hawk's crew with the infiltration. Although they had hoped for the element of surprise, shortly after Revan's arrival a group of Sith ambushed the Jedi. Although the Jedi told Revan to go ahead, the trap had already sprung, and Revan was forced into the battle.\nAfter defeating the Sith, Revan and his companions ran into the Star Forge to find Shan, while the four Jedi waited at the hangar to defend the ship against any further assaults. Revan found and defeated both Shan and Malak, bringing Shan back to the light. Now using her battle meditation to assist the Republic, Shan allowed the assault fleet to find a gap in the enemy lines, and the battle was won by the Republic.\nThe Jedi was a Human female. She had fair skin, dark green eyes, and long black hair tied into a ponytail.\nThe Jedi wore typical light beige Jedi apparel, with a white tunic, white pants, and dark brown boots. She carried a one single-bladed violet lightsaber, which she used in combat.\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic",
