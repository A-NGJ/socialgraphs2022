 "content": "Sartok was a charismatic male Nazren, who was leader of the Nizon resistance shortly after the end of the Clone Wars.\nAn older member of his species, Sartok was missing the second and fourth fingers from his left hand, and he had several scars, including some across his face. He was a darker shade of brown than most of his brethren, with lighter splotches of skin at his wrinkles and creases.\nAfter Nizon, the Nazren homeworld, was occupied by the Galactic Empire, Sartok tried to free his people. He was eventually able to do so during the Battle of Nizon, with the help of some agents working for the Alderaanian Resistance.",
