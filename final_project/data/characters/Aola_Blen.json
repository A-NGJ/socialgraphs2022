 "content": "Aola Blen was a female Twi'lek and the younger sister of Mala Blen. Together, the Twi'leks ruled Thaere Privo in a complex interplay of power politics. The sisters had some contact with the Hutt crime lord Riboga from the neighboring Cularin system. In public, Aola appeared subservient to the Hutt, but is was rumored that in private, Aola despised the Hutt, and would never meet with him unless she had an escape ship nearby.\nShortly after Riboga's departure from the Cularin system, both the Blen sisters died, and the control of Thaere Privo shifted to the Bothan Bal Ferensil.",
