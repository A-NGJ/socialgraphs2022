 "content": "This individual was a human male who served in the Alliance Fleet at the beginning of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0 BBY, this human male was stationed onboard the Rebel flagship Profundity during the battle of Scarif, serving as part of the Alliance Fleet. Their mission was to aid Rogue One in recovering the Death Star plans, so that way the Rebellion would have a chance in destroying this battle station.\nAfter Rogue One successfully transmitted the plans to the Profundity, he was given the order along with a number of rebels to evacuate when the Devastator arrived out of hyperspace and disabled the flagship to prevent from fleeing. Just as Imperial forces were boarding the flagship to recover the Death Star plans, he was fleeing with a group of fellow rebel soldiers. When one of the doors was jammed, they tried to calling out for someone. He was the first one to witness the arrival of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who had come to retrieve the plans that were stolen. Without hesitating, he was the first in front of the group to open fire upon the Sith Lord, doing everything in his will to protect the plans from been taken. As the others fired with him, Vader had been deflecting each and every shot with his lightsaber, and this rebel was the first one to be killed when the Sith Lord deflected his shot back into his face.",
