 "content": "Jener Mich was a Human male who collected rare items. He spent his entire life searching and collecting valuable and rare items throughout the whole Galaxy.\nIn 1 ABY Mich traveled to the remote Forest Moon of Endor in search of a few final things to complete his work. He stayed in a small Research Outpost for an extended period of time, occasionally offering rewards to bypassing spacers for gathering rare items for him.\nJener Mich was one of several collector NPCs in Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Introduced in chapter 7 , these non-player characters offered several quests that involved collecting items throughout the game world and killing creatures.",
