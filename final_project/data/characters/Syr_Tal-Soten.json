 "content": "Syr Tal-Soten was a male Ithorian Jedi Knight, serving the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He came under the sway of the dark side of the Force on a search mission for Jedi Master Kirlocca in the Almas Wastelands.\nDiscovered to be Force-sensitive near birth, Syr Tal-Soten was taken to be trained in the ways of the Force. After passing through one of the Jedi Order's academies and passing his Trials of Knighthood after spending time as a Padawan, Tal-Soten was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council.\nStationed at the academy on Almas under Headmaster Lanius Qel-Bertuk, Tal-Soten served the Order proudly and continued his studies in the Force. In 31 BBY, Tal-Soten was at the Academy when a group of terrorists attacked the Remembrance Hall. Master Qel-Bertuk issued an order to all Jedi, demanding they return to the Academy; however, Master Kirlocca and his charges do not respond from their location in the Almas Wasteland. Qel-Bertuk then assembled a team of Jedi, led by Tantron Dow, and including his Padawan Alkin Saad, Jedi Trevon Rey, Seeth'tal, and Tal-Soten to located and escort Kirlocca and his students back to the academy. While the team wandered through the wastelands, Tal-Soten received a vision of Master Kirlocca's betrayal of the Order, and all present became convinced of this inevitable occurrence. In fact, the Jedi had been affected by the strong surge in the dark side of the Force that was present in the wastelands, and they all had become deranged. Crashing their shuttle in the wastelands, the crazed rescue team continued on foot on their hunt for Kirlocca.\nHaving lost contact with the academy, Qel-Bertuk sent out another search team to recover the first and Master Kirlocca. The second team discovered the downed shuttle being picked apart by Squib salvagers and stop to search it. Inside they discover Padawan Saad's body and the confused and frantic Duros Master Dow. After calming the crazed Jedi, he directs them down the path Jedi Tal-Soten and the others had gone in search of Kirlocca. Arriving at Kirlocca's abandoned campsite where Tal-Soten and his group had killed a Jedi and injured Padawan Hary'nkel, the Twi'lek girl reveals that Tal-Soten and his group had attacked them and the others had fled further into the wastes. Following the sounds of lightsaber combat, the second search party comes across Jedi Tal-Soten engaged in fighting Kirlocca and his surviving campers. The search party quickly help subdue Rey, Seeth'tal, and Sal-Toten, all of whom were taken back to the academy for evaluation and possibly return to the light side.",
