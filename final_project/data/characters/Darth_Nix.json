 "content": "Darth Nix was a Human female Sith Lord who was active during the reign of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, between 130 ABY and 138 ABY. Nix had yellow eyes, light-colored skin, short black hair, and light blue Sith tattoos.\nDarth Nix was clothed in a revealing outfit that exposed the majority of her body. Her legs and waist were covered in sheer black material that extended down to black boots with patterned blocks situated on each of her legs. On her head, Nix wore two spiked metal headdresses that were attached near each temple and extended above her head and below her jawline. Additionally, Nix wielded a single pink-bladed lightsaber with a black hilt.\nDarth Nix is a character created for Red Fly Studio's video game Battle of the Sith Lords. Nix's design was created by concept artist Thomas A. Szakolczay at some point prior to the game's cancellation in 2011. Szakolczay described Nix as \"brash.\"",
