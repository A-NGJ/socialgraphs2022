 "content": "Pg'lax was an entrepreneurial Verpine who established the Quick Pit docking bay service on the outskirts of Mos Eisley, on the planet Tatooine, during the early years of the New Order.\nPg'lax himself was born in the Roche system, and was noted for his love of racing. He became one of the most successful crew crew leaders on the professional swoop racing circuit, and was on Tatooine when his success caught up with him and a group of rival crews waylaid Pg'lax and his team, sabotaging their starship and stranding them on Tatooine. A brief career as a mechanic at the Mos Espa Grand Arena was followed by another attempt to destroy his career, and Pg'lax fled to Mos Eisley. There, where he discovered his niche as a starship servicer, and he eventually was able to earn enough credits to start the Quick Pit operation.",
