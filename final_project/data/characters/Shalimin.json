 "content": "Shalimin was a male Mon Calamari Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order during the last years of the Galactic Republic, and participated in the Clone Wars.\nA male Mon Calamari born on the planet Dac, Shalimin was identified as Force-sensitive and sent to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be trained in the ways of the Force. After years of group study within the walls of the Temple, Shalimin was noticed by the Jedi Master Upulu who quickly took him as a Padawan.\nAs the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, broke out across the galaxy Shalimin was given the title of Jedi Commander and fought on many fronts. Serving alongside Jedi High Council member Kit Fisto during the Battle of Dac, Shalimin shamed his master when he reveled deeply in the victory. In order to reprimand his student, Upulu sent Shalimin to the planet Argul to serve under Grand Master Yoda in the battle there. Greatly disliking the world, Shalimin nonetheless fought alongside other master-less Padawans against the Separatist Droid Army, forcing an uneasy stand-off until reinforcements arrived, which led to a Republic victory.\nShalimin made his only appearance in Only the Force, a scenario for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In that, the player playing as Shalimun can choose Shalimun's sex. However, he is described as male in the biographies of the other playable characters, so that can be assumed to be his canonical sex.",
