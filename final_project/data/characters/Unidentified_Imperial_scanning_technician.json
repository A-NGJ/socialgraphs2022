 "content": "A scanning technician was stationed on the Relentless, an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer belonging to Admiral Kassius Konstantine, in 4 BBY. He operated the scanners the Star Destroyer used to inspect incoming ships, and informed the Admiral that a VCX-100 light freighter was being scanned, and that there was something odd about it. The ship came through as the Tontine, cleared for travel between Boz Pity and Lothal. When the ship was revealed as the rebel starship Ghost due to its signature modulator being damaged, the technician informed Konstantine, who ordered TIE fighters after it.\nHe was voiced by Steve Blum, who also voiced Zeb in the series.",
