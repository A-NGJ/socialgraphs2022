 "content": "The Megawok was a giant Ewok that wreaked havoc amongst denizens of the galaxy during 4 ABY, around the time of the Battle of Endor.\nThe Megawok was one of the events added into Star Wars Galaxies as part of the activities commemorating the end of the game on December 15, 2011. He was known to have attacked Mos Entha on the Starsider, Chilastra and Gorath servers, and Endor on the Flurry server. However, it's not clear if he was ever spawned on the remaining live servers, making his canon status ambiguous.",
