 "content": "A male Muun banker was a member of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and lived on the planet Scipio. The banker was married with children, and employed a human man as his personal attach√©. When the banker's wife, and his employee, were killed in an accident, the banker adopted the employee's son, Rush Clovis, as his own child. Clovis eventually joined the Banking Clan himself, and came to serve as the senator for Scipio in the Galactic Senate.",
