 "content": "Atali was a male Human who served as First Officer aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Mathayus under Admiral Coy.\nDuring a mission to transport Darth Vader to Dargulli, the Mathayus intercepted a small Rebel starship. Atali was sent with a team of stormtroopers to investigate it. Unfortunately for him, the ship was a decoy laden with explosives that were set to go off if the ship's hull was breached. As Atali and his men entered, the explosives went off, killing him and badly damaging the Mathayus's hangar bay.",
