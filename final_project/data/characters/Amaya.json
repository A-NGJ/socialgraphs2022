 "content": "Amaya was a Human woman who attended the celebrations in Gadrin for the 200th anniversary of the city's founding by Reidi Artom. She and her friend Suki went to Vanster Enan's Sop House to try to find men to party with. By the time that Darin burst into the cantina, she had hooked up with Kip, who was a greaseball but the only prospect in the Sop House.",
