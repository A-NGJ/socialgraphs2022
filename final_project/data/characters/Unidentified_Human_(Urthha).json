 "content": "This Human lived on the planet Urthha and once helped the Duros newlyweds Etro and Droza Edthatt escape the planet with a matter catalyst.\nThis individual was mentioned in a two-page story titled \"Aliens Kidnapped by Humans!,\" a gossip magazine parody attributed to Trebor Uarrac of The Galactic Gossip, originally written by Bob Carrau for the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that combines creature designs and photographs from various projects of George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise, with a variety of original short fiction pieces written by Carrau. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical.\nIn the story, two Duros newlyweds named Etro and Droza Edthatt are \"abducted by human beings\" from the planet \"Urthha.\" After more than four solar periods of unusual experiences, they use a \"matter catalyst,\" which the humans call a \"blender,\" to leave the planet.",
