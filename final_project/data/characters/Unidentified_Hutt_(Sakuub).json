 "content": "This Hutt was present on Sakuub during the honeymoon of Jaina Solo and Jagged Fel, and was seen suspiciously slithering into a Sakuub marketplace alleyway, which caused the couple to become worried and befuddled. Later, this Hutt turned out to be there to help the newlywed couple, destroying an attacking ship, and revealing that the Hutt's employer hired the individual to help the two, for their support of the Treaty of Vontor. The Hutt then departed without giving a name, and gruffly accepted their thanks.",
