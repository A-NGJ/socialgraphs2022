 "content": "Thakba Besadii Diori was a minor Hutt criminal kingpin of the Besadii kajidic. Thakba dealt in spice and operated from the planet Sleheyron, where he resided in a mansion in the company of his Devaronian majordomo and a group of of Gamorrean guards. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, after the Aqualish pirate Bandin Dobah began exerting control over the flow of contraband into and out of Formos, a planet situated near to Hutt Space, the Hutts did not take kindly to Dobah's activities and Thakba placed a bounty of 5,000 for his capture. Thakba issued the bounty primarily as a public relations exercise, hoping to improve his reputation within the smuggling community.\nA group of individuals succeeded at capturing Dobah and they subsequently turned the pirate over the Thakba on Sleheyron. The Hutt forced Dobah to fight in a gladiatorial contest held within a nearby arena and he watched on as Dobah was killed during his second bout, in combat against a Weequay.",
