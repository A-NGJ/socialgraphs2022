 "content": "Lisali Mitallan was a female Pantoran Force Adept who helped fix podraces for the Gand podracer Dooarix Gyll during the Galactic Civil War.\nA friend of the skilled podracer Dooarix Gyll, Lisali Mitallan worked as his spotter during the reign of the Galactic Empire on Nar Shaddaa. Using her Force-sensitivity to communicate hazards on the track to Gyll, Mitillan would place high bets on Gyll's race and win big when she assisted him, hoping to put the funds towards leaving the Smuggler's Moon.\nAfter their fifth win in six weeks, Mitillan and Gyll were interrogated by Tal Feint, a Muun investigator who had seen each of the three races which gave them such success. Feint, who was employed by Zeto, attempted to confront them about Mitillan's spotting operation, but was interrupted by Zeto who wished violence against the two racers. When Mitillan used the Force to throw Zeto against a wall, Feint used his own power of persuasion to send his employer's hired hands away and offered to help Gyll and Mitillan use their Force skills for things greater then fixing races.",
