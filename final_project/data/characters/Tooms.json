During the battle, a disturbance occurred over the comm channel and Tooms was put off by the sound. After another pirate was shot down, Gorr ordered the rest of them to retreat. Tooms had gray hair, orange eyes, and gray skin.\nTooms first appeared in \"The Triple Dark,\" the second episode of Star Wars Resistance Season One. He was voiced by Jonathan Lipow who also voiced both Hallion Nark and Nod in the episode.",
