 "content": "A Jabiimi Human female was a cousin of the Jabiimi Nationalists commander Alto Stratus. During the Battle of Jabiim between the Jabiimi Loyalists and the Jabiimi Nationalists, she had been shot in the gut with a blaster, and then, her legs were crushed by a Republic walker. Alto Stratus witnessed his cousin as she crawled through the mud. Severely injured, she died in Stratus' arms, whose resolve to destroy the Jedi solidified. In the next week, Stratus remembered his cousin's death as he beheaded Jedi General Norcuna during the battle near the city of Choal.",
