 "content": "Parnax was a male of Human or Sith pureblood descent who held the title of Sith Lord in the Sith Empire in the years before the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Parnax was deeply unpopular even among his own family, and he spent his brief career as a Sith betraying every one of his allies and accumulating a long list of powerful enemies.\nAround 3683 BBY, Parnax, believed by some to either have been incredibly arrogant or incredibly stupid, deliberately broke into the Dark Temple, a forbidden Sith structure on the planet Dromund Kaas that had been sealed for centuries, in search of the key to the Sith Emperor's power. Parnax recorded his experiences in several journals, chronicling his descent into madness as he found himself unable to leave the Temple and discovered the Emperor's plans to extinguish all life in the galaxy. Parnax ultimately committed suicide, as he believed he could survive the coming darkness by merging with the Force.\nParnax was originally slated to be the focus of a Codex entry in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare, but the entry was removed before the game's release in 2011, and his species was never specified.",
