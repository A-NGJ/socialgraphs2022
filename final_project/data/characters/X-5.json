 "content": "X-5 was a Human male assassin who, along with six other men, was hired by Commander Rezi Soresh to participate in Project Omega. The operation was an experiment by the Galactic Empire to create the perfect assassin. Soresh cleared the participants' identities from a database system and altered their faces surgically. He then started his reconditioning program, which was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their memories and emotions.\nAt first, X-5 became friends with X-1, X-2, X-3, X-4, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-5, like the others, had his personality and mind changed until he felt no emotions. Around 10 BBY, the trainees were pitted against each other until only one remained. X-5 malfunctioned and began muttering about alliances. He encouraged the others to see Soresh as their enemy. Just before all of X-7's emotions had gone, he killed X-5, earning the right to become Soresh's assassin.\nX-5 appeared in a flashback sequence in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published in 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler.",
