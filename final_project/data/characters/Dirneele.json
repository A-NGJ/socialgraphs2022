 "content": "Dirneele was a dancer who worked in a noisy club in Tindark, one of the platform cities of Cularin. She had dark hair and eyes, but used wigs and eye implants to change her appearance for her performances. In 31 BBY, she longed to find a better job or at least a better club, but was under contract until 29 BBY. She usually knew what was going on in Tindark's underworld.",
