 "content": "\"Green Leader\" was a human male pilot that served in the early rebellion during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Around 2 BBY, he served as leader of Green Squadron, where he and his squadron of six A-wings were tasked with escorting a GR-75 medium transport near Teralov. The convoy came under attack by Imperials and all rebel ships were destroyed by the TIE/IN interceptors.\nThis pilot wore a green flight suit and a grey helmet with a gold visor. He flew an A-wing, that was light grey with strip of blue, instead of green like the rest of his squadron.\nThe character first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels \"The Antilles Extraction\", where his voice was provided by Steve Blum.",
