 "content": "Sylva was a Human female who lived on Telerath in the city of Noua. In 19 BBY, she was employed at Ember's Fire, a club owned by Ember Chankeli. On one day, Sylva was harassed by a patron sitting down to eat and drink. Sylva called for the help of Tam, another worker, who pressed a button sending the angered patron through the floor and into a body of water beneath the establishment.\nTheir boss, Chankeli, later reprimanded the two women for dropping a \"paying customer,\" and was about to threaten them by withholding credits, when she was interrupted by the arrival of Dass Jennir.",
