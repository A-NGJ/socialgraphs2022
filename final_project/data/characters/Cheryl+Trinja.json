 "content": "Cheryl Trinja was a Force-sensitive Human. She was orphaned on a lightly-populated farming planet when her parents were killed during Imperial military action. She grew up alone in a forest, where her natural Force ability manifested itself in unusual ways. She could easily send thoughts to the forest animals, and as such the animals cared and provided for her as she grew up.\nAt the age of seven, stormtroopers tried to capture her, and Cheryl was forced to defend herself using the most brutal carnivores in the forest. In the second such battle, while Cheryl was watching her friends die to protect her, she was rescued from the Imperials by a group of traders.\nCheryl joined up with the traders and left the planet. She was given the nickname \"the Natural\". Where she later traveled was unknown.",
