 "content": "Rune was a male Mon Calamari Jedi who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final decades before the rise of the Galactic Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Mon Calamari, Rune was trained in the ways of the Force and lightsaber combat by the Jedi Order. Having constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber, Rune escaped execution when the Galactic Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Jedi through the initiation of Contingency Order 66. As the Order was disbanded and the few survivors scattered, Rune was placed on a list of other Jedi survivors by the newly formed Galactic Empire. By 1 ABY, he had a sizable bounty placed on his head, becoming one of the Bounty Hunters' Guild top ten most wanted fugitives. At this time, an unknown bounty hunter tracked down the Jedi and killed him, collecting the long-standing bounty.\nRune, along with several other fugitives of various backgrounds, ranging from murderers to Imperial deserters, is part of a kill collection in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. Bounty Hunter players using the skill \"Bounty Check\" may check random humanoid NPCs throughout the galaxy, randomly exposing one of the ten fugitives. Killing the fugitive will add them to the player's collection. Killing all ten rewards the player with two schematics, the first for a improved version of the DC-15A blaster rifle, the second for a similarly improved version of the EE-3 carbine rifle. The collection was repeatable, allowing the player to repeat it for more schematics.",
