 "content": "Corin was a male guard in the Royal Naboo Security Forces, serving Senator Padmé Amidala under Captain Mariek Panaka and Sergeant Gregar Typho. When Amidala wished to switch out with her decoy Sabé during a gala held by Mon Mothma, she used Corin's uniform as he was the only one who was short enough that it would fit. Later, after the uniform was dirtied while Amidala and Typho were sneaking around a garden level of the area where the gala was being held, Amidala thought that she would have to clean the uniform for Corin.\nCorin was mentioned in the 2019 novel Queen's Shadow.",
