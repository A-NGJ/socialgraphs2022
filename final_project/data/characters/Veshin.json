 "content": "Veshin was a female Tarasin, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nVeshin served the Wyrd, a group of Tarasin Force witches, as a soldier. She was the personal bodyguard of the Wyrd sister Baeshana.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Veshin was present on Cularin in the central hut of the village where the Zhadorii irstat lived, when she and Baeshana were attacked by the heroes of Cularin.\nIn Hunting the Wyrd the identity of the Wyrd sister and bodyguard that the player characters fight in the central hut varies, depending on player level. Upper-level players fight Baeshana and Veshin, but Mid-Level players fight Naelora and Kosaa instead, while High-Level players face Torunin and Savina. It is also possible for the players to avoid the hut, so even Upper-Level players don't have to fight Baeshana and Veshin.",
