 "content": "Suraya was a Human criminal who ran the black market on the planet Tasariq. A smuggler operating in the Outer Rim Territories, Suraya once upset Jabba the Hutt by praising one of his lieutenants who had, unbeknownst to Suraya, been fed to the Jabba's rancor. Fearing for his life, Suraya fled Coreward, ending up on Tasariq.\nSuraya arrived on the same day Governor Dem Keval announced new tariffs on off-world goods. The smuggler had money and contacts, and established himself as the foremost black market operator on the planet. Suraya paid protection money to Captain Kullan Velerinden and kept a low profile, buying a K4 security droid named K4X4 to protect him from Jabba's reprisals. In truth, Jabba had long forgotten about Suraya.",
