 "content": "This Zabrak male salvager was a member of a group of scavengers who managed to salvage a TIE Advanced starfighter on Tatooine. He was planning to sell the fighter to Jabba the Hutt. Unfortunately for him and his associates, a Jawa stole the TIE fighter.\nThis individual only appears in the story Oh!! Jawajawa, published in Star Wars Manga: Silver issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical.",
