 "content": "Chokk was a male Klatooinian who lived on Tatooine during the Battle of Naboo. He was employed as a guard by Jabba Desilijic Tiure and guarded him during his appearance at the Boonta Eve Classic in 32 BBY. Chokk took pride in his work as a guard for Jabba, and Jabba expressed fondness for him. As well as a bodyguard for hire, Chokk was also an explosives expert.\nChokk was a Klatooinian male who was employed by Jabba Desilijic Tiure as an armed guard sometime prior to or during the Battle of Naboo. He was present at the Boonta Eve Classic in 32 BBY, where he stood near and guarded Jabba from any potential threats.\nAccording to Jabba, Chokk did his job as an armed body guard adroitly and skillfully. Jabba often chose Chokk to work as his body guard in special situations, one of which was the Boonta Eve Classic. As well as being an bodyguard for hire, Chokk was an explosives expert. During the Boonta Eve Classic in 32 BBY, Chokk wore dark blue pants and a crimson tunic fastened with a belt that had an array of pouches.\nChokk first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, which was released in 1999. Chokk was later identified in Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary as one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's bodyguards during the Boonta Eve Classic. However, this depiction was contradicted by Star Wars Customizable Card Game and the Young Jedi Collectible Card Game, both of which were released in 2001. While the respective Card Games used an image of a Klatooinian in a red tunic, the Visual Guide's uses an image portraying Chokk as an armed guard standing near the Hutt that is clearly contradictory to the Card Games' images. He was portrayed by Bill Tlusty.",
