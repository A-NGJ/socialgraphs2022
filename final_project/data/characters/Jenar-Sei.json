 "content": "Jenar-Sei was a Voss male who was the Commander of a squad of Voss commandos that patrolled the lands of the Gormak during the Cold War.\nAround 3640 BBY, he discovered that the Gormak were mining a deposit of precious Force crystals, sacred to the Voss Mystics, that they were using to subdue ferocious beasts to use against the Voss. Fortunately, at this time in the Gormak-occupied Halls of the Righteous, Jenar met the Barsen'thor and Gaden-Ko and asked for help. With his new allies, Jenar destroyed the Gormak mining equipment and stopped the local Gormak patrols.\nImpressed with the power of his allies, Jenar-Sei decided to enter with his men to the retinue of Gaden-Ko, following him and the Barsen'thor in their fight against the Sith Empire.",
