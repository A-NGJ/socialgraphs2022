 "content": "CT-0000/1010, nicknamed \"Fox,\" was a loyal clone trooper who fought as a soldier in the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the length of the Clone Wars. By 19 BBY, he was serving as a Clone Sergeant in the 501st Legion on the Republic's capital, Coruscant. After Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine issued Order 66, Fox was deployed during the siege of the Jedi Temple.\nFox's unit was assigned to guard the temple's exit and entry points, and his commanding officer, Clone Commander CC-1119, ordered Senator Bail Organa to leave when the senator arrived to investigate. Before Organa could comply, the clones with Appo and Fox were attacked by Padawan Zett Jukassa, who struck down Appo during his escape attempt. Fox then fatally shot the Padawan, but having grown weary of fighting during the war, the sergeant ordered his men to let Organa flee the scene.\nCT-0000/1010 was the designation of a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, who was created on the planet Kamino in order to serve as a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. He served throughout the entirety of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems as part of the 501st Legion, spending most of the war stationed on Coruscant, the capital of the Republic.\nBy the year 19 BBY, CT-0000/1010 had earned the rank of Clone Sergeant and was known by the nickname \"Fox.\" In that year, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine issued Order 66 to all clone forces, tasking them with killing all members of the Jedi Order. The sergeant was among the 501st forces led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader in the siege of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\nFox's unit was assigned the duty of guarding the entrances and exits to the temple. The day after the attack, he he was present with several other troopers as well as Clone Commander CC-1119 \"Appo\" on one of the temple's landing pads when Senator Bail Organa arrived in a landspeeder to investigate what was going on. Appo claimed the Jedi had betrayed the Republic and then swiftly ordered Organa to leave, but as the senator did so the Jedi Padawan Zett Jukassa attacked Appo and his men.\nAs the commander and those around him were cut down, the remaining clones opened fire on the young Jedi and a bolt from Fox's blaster dealt the killing blow. Organa quickly fled the scene in his speeder as the clones prepared to fire on him too, but as Appo was wounded, the sergeant ordered his men to stand down. A year later in 18 BBY, Organa still experienced nightmares about Fox killing Jukassa. The dreams varied, with the senator sometimes saving the Padawan and sometimes being killed by the clones alongside him.\nFox was a loyal soldier throughout the entirety of the Clone Wars, but by the war's end he had grown tired of the fighting. Having to kill Jukassa during Order 66 was the final straw, causing him to lose all desire for battle and to give the order to allow Organa to flee. As a clone of Fett, Fox stood 1.83 meters tall.\nFox wore Phase II clone trooper armor with the blue markings of the 501st Legion and used a DC-15A blaster rifle.\nCT-0000/1010 appeared in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, which was released on May 19, 2005. His scene was filmed on a raised set against a blue screen on Monday, July 28, 2003 on Stage 5 at Shepperton Studios. Like all clones in the film, he was voiced by Temuera Morrison and generated using CGI.\nThe sergeant was not named in the film, but was identified in the current Star Wars canon in the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, which initially launched in 2013. Although the launch of Force Collection predates the Star Wars canon reset of 2014, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon. The designation and nickname originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where they were first used in the article \"Guide to the Grand Army of the Republic,\" which was written by Karen Traviss and Ryan Kaufman and published in Star Wars Insider 84 on September 26, 2005. Fox also appeared prior to the release of film in Legends in the novelization of Revenge of the Sith, which was written by Matthew Stover and released on April 2, 2005.",
