 "content": "Zarda was a human male who served in the Imperial Navy as a captain during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. He commanded a class four container transport that was tasked with transporting specimens from a variety of rare species to the planet Coruscant, where they would be added to the Galactic Emperor Palpatine's personal zoo. During the journey, the VCX-100 light freighter Ghost approached his transport and so was attacked by TIE/ln space superiority starfighter from the Imperial vessel; however, the freighter managed to evade the starfighters and destroy several of them. On the transport's bridge, Doctor Hazlekk—who was personally responsible for the delivery of the animals—demanded to know why Zarda's men had managed to destroy the Ghost.\nZarda began to assure Hazlekk there was nothing to worry about, but was cut off by an alarm that signalled a hull breach. He and the doctor led a contingent of stormtroopers to secure the creatures, but found that they had all been released by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. They then battled with the rebels and the creatures, but were locked in the cages by Ohnaka. The rebels then escaped with one of the creatures, the argora.\nZarda first appeared in the 2018 comic book story \"Endangered, Part 1,\" which was written by Sholly Fisch, illustrated by Sean Galloway and released in Star Wars Adventures  7.",
