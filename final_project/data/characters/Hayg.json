 "content": "Hayg was a Human male who was a Master Sergeant in the Imperial Military of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. During the invasion of Belsavis, Hayg was stationed at the deep launchpoint transfer far into the Tomb. After the Esh-kha used experimental weapons to wipe out an Imperial unit, Specialist Nattis of the Imperial Reclamation Service tried to convince Hayg to divert forces and destroy the weapons, but Hayg was shorthanded and did not take the threat seriously. Nattis was forced to recruit other Imperials in the area.\nMaster Sergeant Hayg appears on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he and Nattis provide Imperial players with the mission \"Found in Translation.\"",
