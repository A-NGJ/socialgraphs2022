 "content": "Sebaracca was a female Wookiee entrepreneur and the owner and manager of Club 111, a drinking and dancing venue in the city of Depatar, in the gas giant Genarius. She was commonly in her bar or dancing in the floor, trying to ensure that everyone was having fun and spending money.\nSebaracca had two hired Wookiee porters, Bael and Touda, who exercised her the right to refuse admission. Bael and Touda decided who could enter the Club, commonly based on the disguises the prospective customers were wearing.\nSebaracca knew that a certain amount of criminal activities took place in her lounge â€” something unsurprising in a city like Depatar, known as one of the biggests black markets in the Cularin system. She allowed it as long as she could collect a tenth of any amount changing hands.",
