 "content": "J. K. Burtola was a human male who joined the Jedi Order at a young age and as a Jedi youngling trained as a member of Bear Clan. In 22 BBY, he and his clanmates received lightsaber training from Jedi Grand Master Yoda in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. The lesson was interrupted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who sought Yoda's help in locating the planet Kamino. The Grand Master opened up the question of why the planet might be missing from the Jedi Archives to the class, and Burtola answered that it must have been erased by someone.\nJ. K. Burtola was a Force-sensitive human male who was born at some point between 30 BBY and 26 BBY. As a young child he became a member of the Jedi Order's Bear Clan of younglings and trained in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. In 22 BBY, Burtola and the rest of the Bear Clan were practicing with training lightsabers under the tutelage of Jedi Grand Master Yoda in one of the temple's classrooms when the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi interrupted the lesson to seek Yoda's guidance.\nYoda halted the class, and Burtola and the others greeted Kenobi, who explained that he was looking for the planet Kamino, but could not find it in the Jedi Archives. Yoda asked Burtola's classmate Liam to lower the classroom's blinds so that Kenobi could show the class a holographic star map and indicate where the planet should be. The Grand Master then asked the class if they had any thoughts on why the planet might be missing, and Burtola suggested that it might have been erased from the archives. Satisfied with this answer, Yoda moved away from the younglings to speak briefly with Kenobi about this troubling idea.\nBurtola was Force-sensitive and had fair skin, brown eyes and brown hair.\nBurtola wore brown Jedi robes, a brown belt and a gray training helmet while at the temple and used a practice lightsaber.\nJ. K. Burtola was portrayed by Alex Knoll, son of Industrial Light \u0026 Magic chief creative officer John Knoll, in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and was identified in the film's credits. The character was identified as simply \"Jedi Child Jack\" in the film's script.",
