 "content": "Lieutenant Vale was a Neimoidian pilot during the Yuuzhan Vong War. She was a member of Twin Suns Squadron, and, as Twin Suns Two, was Jaina Solo's wingmate. However, she was not a very good pilot, being forced to return to Ralroost during the New Republic raid on Ylesia, only surviving due to the intervention of Jacen Solo, whose X-wing was actually more damaged. Vale was killed in the crossfire at the Battle of Ebaq 9.\nIn the first half of The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way, Vale is referenced as a Duros, then in the later half of that novel, she is referenced as a Neimoidian. She is also called a Neimoidian in The New Jedi Order: Ylesia and The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
