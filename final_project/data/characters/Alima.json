 "content": "Alima was a male Human who served in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War.\nAlima was born on Coruscant. He rose through the ranks of the Navy to reach captain of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Conquest.\nHe was given the task of subjugating Ithor and leveled much of Ithor's Cathor Hills. For his actions he was given the opportunity of becoming captain of Darth Vader's flagship. Realizing the threat this posed to his life, Alima purposefully got himself demoted to prevent himself from becoming captain.\nAfterwards he was placed in charge of locating C-3PO and R2-D2 on Tatooine and discovered Momaw Nadon, his old Ithorian nemesis, in Mos Eisley, and demanded that the Ithorian find the droids, or the Galactic Empire would wipe out his gardens.\nAfter the Millennium Falcon escaped from Tatooine, Nadon told the Imperial Prefect that Alima had ignored Nadon's information regarding the Millennium Falcon. Alima was executed by the Prefect instantly. Nadon, regretting his actions, stole genetic samples of Alima's DNA and cloned the former captain. In keeping with the Law of Life, Nadon made two clones of Alima, in punishment for Alima's actions, and as a reminder of Nadon's.",
