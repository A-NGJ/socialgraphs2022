 "content": "Jeb Maris was a Human male who served as a TIE pilot of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Jeb Maris was a TIE bomber pilot who served in the Starfighter Corps of the Imperial Navy.\nIn 1 ABY, an accident took place in an Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nIn the meantime, Jeb Maris' TIE squadron was dispatched in the area. However, an inexperienced TIE pilot rammed Maris' TIE bomber and clipped its wing. Jeb Maris eventually crashed in the Quarantine Zone. The pilot later took shelter in Camp Alpha, along with the Rebel Sergeant Mika Horn and the Bothan Oona Wran.\nJeb Maris was stuck in the Quarantine Zone with a number of radios that allowed him to communicate with people on the outside of the Quarantine Zone. However, the pilot knew there was other refugee camps in the Quarantine Zone and decided to establish a communication network with the other survivors. Maris therefore recruited spacers who had ventured in the Quarantine Zone and tasked them with delivering radios to the other camps. The spacers brought radios to Volo Madine in Camp Beta, Tripp D'jek in Camp Gamma, TR-522 in Camp Delta, and finally Sogan Varga in Camp Epsilon. Once communications were established in the five camps, the survivors were able to safely coordinate high altitude supply drops sent from outside the Quarantine Zone.\nJeb Maris was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jeb Maris was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
