 "content": "Brogar was a male Advozse who owned a cantina on the planet Lok which doubled as a safehouse for those who needed a place to lay low. Brogar used armed droid bouncers to keep the peace within his establishment.\nBy the year 137 ABY, some of his patrons included a complusive gambler named Naxy Screeger and a fugitive Jedi named Hosk Trey'lis, both of whom were captured in defiance of Brogar's offered sanctuary by Cade Skywalker, Jariah Syn, and Deliah Blue.\nBrogar denied to the trio of bounty hunters that he knew Trey'lis was a Jedi, but it was implied that he was aware of this. Because of the high risks involved with harboring a Jedi, Brogar allowed the breach in protocol and told Cade that this with a gesture of good faith to Cade's employer, the dreaded pirate Rav. Unfortunately for his well-being, his acquaintance with Cade would come back to haunt him, when the New Galactic Empire came by and questioned about him.",
