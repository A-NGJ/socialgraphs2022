 "content": "Brashaa was a member of the Empire Reborn, which was led by the Dark Jedi Hethrir, the former Imperial Procurator of Justice. He was rich and powerful, owning vast resources including starships and having several followers.\nBrashaa attended Hethrir's meeting on Crseih Station, where he bought Chamberlain Iyon's wyrwulf offspring from Lady Ucce. His greed infuriated Hethrir, who tried to kill him using the Force. However the warping effect on the Force caused by that system's quantum crystal star dampened Hethrir's ability, preventing him from telekinetically throttling the stingy supporter.\nFollowing the death of Hethrir and the capture of Crseih Station by New Republic forces, he was presumably arrested by New Republic Intelligence for his role in the slave trade.",
