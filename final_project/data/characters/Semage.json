 "content": "Semage was a human male guard who served under Senator Larik. Semage, along with Hanel, wanted to force the corrupt Larik to Raxus Secundus, but were both stopped by Dooku and Mace Windu after a Jedi was murdered on the planet. Semage and Hanel tried to kill the two Jedi, but were overwhelmed. Semage was arrested by the two Jedi while Hanel was killed in an ensuing fight. Semage was placed in jail with the other conspirators, but was visited by Dooku, who told them not to lose heart for the fight.",
