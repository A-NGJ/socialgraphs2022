 "content": "Crystal was a female Twi'lek who oversaw the dancer girls owned by Toobu the Hutt on Nar Shaddaa. During the Galactic War she was approached by a Sith and Vette, who was looking for her sister Tivva, and Crystal helpfully directed her to them. Afterwards, the Sith bought the freedom for Tivva and, after thanking Vette, she went her own way, promising to stay in touch.",
