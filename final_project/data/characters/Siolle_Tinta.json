 "content": "Siolle Tinta was a woman from Corellia, the daughter of the owner of Tinta Lines. Once she was the subject of a kidnapping threat, and was placed under the protection of CorSec agents Corran Horn and Iella Wessiri. While Wessiri tracked down and apprehended the would-be kidnapper, Horn stayed hidden with Siolle, and the two shared a brief romance that bloomed when they realized they had the same tastes in art. However, they both recognized that a relationship wouldn't work, and so parted ways soon after.\nSiolle enjoyed going to spas on Selonia and art exhibits on Coruscant.",
