 "content": "Commander Hotise was a Human male who served as a medical doctor, veteran of the Clone Wars and the commander of the Imperial medical frigate MedStar Four. He was a short, rotund man and wore a cropped beard. Dr Kornell Divini was under Hotise's command for a short time prior to Divini's assignment to the first Death Star.\nHotise eventually transferred to the Death Star himself where he assumed command of the N-One Medcenter and once again became Dr Divini's superior. He was presumably killed onboard the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.",
