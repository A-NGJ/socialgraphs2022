 "content": "Dagga Marl was the bodyguard of Thrackan Sal-Solo during his brief time as President of the Ylesian Republic. Sal-Solo chose her for her skill—something his official guard lacked in abundance—and her mercenary nature.\nIn exchange for one kilogram of glitterstim—which had virtually replaced other currency on Ylesia—every week, plus a bonus if he required her to kill someone, Marl kept a close eye on Sal-Solo, which she considered a challenge. Earlier in her career, she had worked as an assassin for the Ylesian Senate, and as a bounty hunter.\nMarl and Sal-Solo were both captured by the New Republic at the Battle of Ylesia in 28 ABY. Assuming the mantle of Ludus Fazum, the Peace Brigade leader claimed himself and his companion to be a couple who were refugees from the Mid Rim world of Falleen that were taken to the Hutt Space world of Ylesia to work as house slaves; Sal-Solo had, in fact, been appointed President of Ylesia by the invading Yuuzhan Vong. The ruse failed when Sal-Solo's cousin and Jedi Knight Jaina Solo arrived on the scene and arrested Sal-Solo and Marl.\nDagga Marl appeared in Walter Jon Williams' 2002 eBook, The New Jedi Order: Ylesia.",
