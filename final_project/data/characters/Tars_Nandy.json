 "content": "Tars Nandy was an Imperial TIE pilot stationed on the Rand Ecliptic.\nNandy was a classmate at the Prefsbelt IV Naval Academy with Biggs Darklighter. He was under the command of First Mate Darklighter when he and other pilots  tried to board and interrogate the crewmembers of the private ship, Lark, in order to ensure they were not involved with the Rebel cause. While disconnecting the shields, Tars fired against the reactor and the ship exploded, killing instantly the 309 students that attended the Clarion Scholars Academy on Daemen. During the mutiny, Derek Klivian arrested or killed Tars Nandy.",
