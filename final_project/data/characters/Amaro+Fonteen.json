 "content": "Amaro Fonteen was an operatic actor that lived during the Imperial Period. He portrayed Duros scout Banu Hydia in the opera, The Kallea Cycle, during its premiere on Brentaal on 38:2:13.\nDuring his performance as Hydia, he wore green pigment on his face and hands, red pigment over his eyes, and a rubber prosthetic to cover his nose in order to play the character. Controversy erupted in the media when it was found that Fonteen, a Human, would be playing the role of Hydia, instead of being traditionally sung by a Duros double bass vocalist. The Brentaal Council on High Human Culture and the Brentaal Hall Conservatory both released statements that denounced the \"narrow-minded idea that a Duros role could not be voiced by a human\".",
