 "content": "Renij Jaa was an Iktotchi male Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jaa was placed in command of all Republic forces in the Druckenwell system and became based on the space station New Dawn. In about 21 BBY, the YT-1300 light freighter Dessin's Dagger attempted to attach a device to a luxury liner in the Druckenwell system and was subsequently pursued by three Republic Z-95 Headhunters. A group of freelance agents assisted the Republic fighters with the capture of the freighter and in the aftermath of the incident, Jaa summoned the agents to New Dawn, so that he could debrief them. A short time later, the agents learned of a Separatist plot to destroy a Republic Acclamator-class assault ship and warned Jaa of the threat, via comlink.\nAn Iktotchi male, Renij Jaa served in the Jedi Order during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. Within the Order, he became a Jedi Guardian, a combat-orientated Jedi specialization, and he eventually constructed his own lightsaber and attained the rank of Jedi Knight. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, a conflict that was fought between the Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems, members of the Jedi Order were called up to serve with and lead the Army of the Republic. Jaa was appointed as the chief coordinator of Republic forces in the Druckenwell system in the Mid Rim and became based on the space station New Dawn, a Republic military installation that orbited the planet Druckenwell.\nIn about 21 BBY, Republic forces in the Druckenwell system sighted the YT-1300 light freighter Dessin's Dagger attempting to attach a device to a luxury liner, and three Republic Z-95 Headhunters were dispatched to apprehend the freighter. Dessin's Dagger attempted to flee the system and was pursued by the three starfighters, and it narrowly avoided a collision with a starship that was carrying the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who had journeyed to Druckenwell from the planet Cularin.\nThe agents helped the Z-95s to immobilize Dessin's Dagger and in the aftermath of the incident, Jaa planned to file a report on the rogue freighter. He summoned the Heroes of Cularin to New Dawn so that he could debrief them on their encounter with Dessin's Dagger, and he met with them in one of the station's conference rooms. After thanking them for the role that they had played in the freighter's capture, Jaa took statements from the agents in relation to who they were and what they were doing in the Druckenwell system. Once he had finished speaking to them, the Jedi signaled to a clone trooper sergeant to escort the agents back to their ship, and they departed from the station.\nA short time later, the Heroes of Cularin learned that a group of Separatist sympathizers were plotting to blow up an Acclamator-class assault ship that was docked with the New Dawn. The agents stowed away on the First Light, a freighter that the conspirators were traveling aboard, and contacted Jaa via comlink, to warn him about the Separatists' plan. While he was skeptical of the agents' claims, he agreed to place all Republic ships in the system on alert and he ordered a freeze on the replenishment ships' stores in the system. The agents eventually seized control of the First Light and thwarted the plot, and Jaa subsequently thanked them for their efforts.\nRenji Jaa wanted to play an active role in defending the Republic from the forces of the Separatists and was irritated by his assignment to monitor war materiel in the Druckenwell system, far behind the front lines of the Clone Wars. While he maintained a professional demeanor, he struggled to master his frustration, and his ill-mood made him abrupt and to the point. During his inquiries into the actions of Dessin's Dagger, Jaa became concerned by the willingness of the freighter's crew to fight to the death, and he suspected that they had planned to carry out something that would be bad for the Republic. Jaa was bilingual and he could speak both Galactic Basic Standard and Iktotchese.\nRenij Jaa was able to use the Force to affect the minds of others, to heal himself, to move objects, to run fast, and to sense things. In addition, he was proficient in the use of the powers battlemind and farsight.\nJaa was created by Morrie Mullins and Lee Pickler for Outward Bound, a 2002 roleplaying adventure that formed part of the Looking In trilogy of the Living Force campaign. During the scenario, the players role-play as the Heroes of Cularin and have the option of aiding the Republic Z-95 Headhunters that pursue Dessin's Dagger. If the players chose to do so, then when they first encounter Jaa on New Dawn he begins his conversation with them by thanking the agents for their assistance. If any of the player characters are Jedi, Jaa then inquires as to where they completed their Jedi training and who their Jedi Masters are, and he wonders to himself why the player character Jedi get to travel the galaxy while he is assigned to remain in the Druckenwell system. If the player characters are helpful to Jaa when he questions them, he informs them that the Republic is willing to pay to repair any damage that they sustained to their starship during their engagement with Dessin's Dagger. However, if any of the players attempt to slice into New Dawn's computer network, Jaa warns them that doing so would be a treasonous act that would be punishable by imprisonment on the planet Kessel.\nWhen the player characters learn that the Separatist sympathizers are planning to attack the Acclamator-class assault ship, the players have the option of attempting to send a warning to Jaa, and Jedi player characters are able to reach him via comlink. Non-Jedi player characters are only able to speak to Jaa after contacting the Druckenwell system's Republic forces and bluffing them into putting the agents into communications with Jaa. If the players then manage to get through to him, Jaa is exasperated by their efforts, but he agrees to listen to their warning.",
