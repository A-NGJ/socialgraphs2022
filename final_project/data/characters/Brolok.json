 "content": "Brolok was a male Gamorrean bounty hunter who earned the nickname \"Boulder\" and served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. He supplied other hunters with equipment during the war and was stationed on board the Vaiken Spacedock space station within the Imperial fleet. Brolok wore a green and yellow set of armor including a helmet, and worked in the supplies section of the station.\nBrolok was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he serves as an Imperial ultimate gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
