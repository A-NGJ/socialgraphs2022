 "content": "Tott Varula was a male Twi'lek who worked as a bartender in the Hedrett Observation Lounge during the time of the Clone Wars.\nVarula was happy to try and make any drink a customer asked him for, although there were gaps in his knowledge. He was an associate of Veneziano Haas and Haas once commed him, to ask him to make a table in the bar available to the Heroes of Cularin, and to give them free drinks. Shortly afterwards, he watched a speech by Senator Lavina Wren on the bar's holoscreen.",
