 "content": "Onkya was a Mon Calamari Jedi youngling who served the Jedi Order and escaped Order 66 with K'Kruhk and Chase Piru.\nOnkya was a Mon Calamari who was a member of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan. The clan was stationed a the Jedi chapter house on Bogden 3. They were awaiting transport back to the Coruscant Jedi Temple, which had been delayed due to the battle there. When masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel arrived with their clone troopers, Order 66 was issued. Several of the younglings were killed as Du Mahn defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, Onkya was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\nOnkya was present when Lumbra and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, Seddwia, jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the Empire.\nThe younglings were freed by K'Kruhk who gave in to un-Jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru, he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber.\nOnkya and the rest of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan relocated to Arkinnea. He was placed into a refugee camp to await resettlement in the open lands. He watched as K'Kruhk broke up a fight between two other refugees. He listened to a refugee as she talked to Piru about the situation in the camp. Later that night, he was in the tent when Master Zao was making a soup for dinner. Onkya eagerly accepted a bowl of soup. After dinner, he observed Zao as he taught the younglings their lesson for the day. The Jedi Master tossed three spice berries in the air, catching two and eating one. Onkya correctly answered that Zao ate the green spice berry.\nDue to Zao's feeling that there was danger in the camp, Onkya and the other younglings fled the camp under the cover of darkness with the Jedi masters. Once they were out in the countryside, Onkya helped the other younglings pick fruit. The clan proceeded to get further away from the refugee camp in a repulsorcart that K'Kruhk stole and Onkya took a nap in the back. Later, he was with the rest of the clan as they raced Piru up a mountain path. As they got to the top, Onkya saw the shattered remains of a large group of refugees. Realizing that some of the dead refugees were from the Republic, Onkya questioned why the Arkinnea Militia would kill them. Shortly afterwords, Onkya and the others saw an Arkinnea ore carrier fly overhead and drop its load of refugees. When the militia spotted the clan, Onkya and the rest of the younglings were put into the repulsorcart and pushed down the mountain towards the forest. The vehicle crashed into a tree when it reached the forest, and Onkya was thrown clear. He fled deeper into the forest with the rest of the clan. He was present when they were confronted by a group of Yunu.\nWhen the soldiers began firing, Zao used a boulder to block their fire while directing Onkya and the rest of the clan to run. The padawan ran a short distance, but returned with the rest of the clan when they heard the firing stop. Onkya accompanied the Yunu to a safe location. He greeted K'Kruhk when the Jedi Master finally caught up with the rest of the clan. Onkya settled down and continued his training in the ways of the Jedi.",
