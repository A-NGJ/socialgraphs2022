 "content": "Grish B'reen was a male Chistori pilot and mercenary during the Galactic Civil War. Soon after the Battle of Yavin, Grish was hired by the assassin X-7 to hunt down and kill Luke Skywalker as part of a mercenary group led by Lune Oddo Divinian. Like most Chistori, B'reen was quick to anger and made no attempt to mask his disdain for Humans. B'reen's last-known ship was a Preybird, which was disabled and claimed by the oceans of Kamino due to a high-tech Imperial security device. B'reen, along with most of Divinian's squad, fell victim to the Imperial \"super-weapon\" experiment on Kamino.",
