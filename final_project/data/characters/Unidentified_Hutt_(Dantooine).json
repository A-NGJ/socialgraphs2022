 "content": "This unidentified Hutt lived on the world of Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. Calder Nettic was rumored to have had business ties with this Hutt prior to his death in 3956 BBY.\nHis fate during the Sith raid is unknown.\nThe existence of this particular Hutt is only hinted at within the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic through a remark made to the player character by Handon Guld. This mention may have been intended as a reference to the character of Shuma before Shuma was cut from the final product.",
