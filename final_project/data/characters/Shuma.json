 "content": "Shuma was a displaced Hutt businessman on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War.\nThe \"black sheep\" of the Hutts, Shuma was a legitimate businessman on the world of Neka before the Jedi Civil War. However, when the Sith armada closed the spacelanes around Neka, Shuma was forced to flee offworld through certain pilots who knew how to penetrate the Sith blockade. Shortly after, a Sith commander gave the order to virus-bomb the planet, destroying all traces of intelligent life.\nShuma arrived on Dantooine at the Jedi Enclave, where the Jedi Council gladly gave him refuge from the war. It is unknown if he escaped death from the Sith twice when Darth Malak attacked Dantooine in 3956 BBY.\nShuma was cut from the final game of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. However, his dialogue paths still exist in the game files.",
