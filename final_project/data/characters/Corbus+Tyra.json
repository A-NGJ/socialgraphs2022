 "content": "Corbus Tyra was a human male criminal. Between 8 BBY and 2 BBY, Tyra was contacted by the Kajain'sa'Nikto Vizam about a job with a reward of a million credits: to recover an urn on the planet Corellia that contained the ashes of Krestrel D'Naran, one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's most hated rivals. Tyra then noted that for the amount of credits on offer, they would not be the only one after the urn, to which Vizam replied that a crew, that consisted of Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Greedo, had already been sent by Jabba. Tyra then traveled to Corellia where, posing as Solo's father Ovan, he encountered the trio, though they were unable to acquire the urn as it had been sold to Madelin Sun on Antillion.\nAfter they made their way to Antillion and found the urn, Tyra was shot in the back by the bounty hunter Krrsantan who left with Solo and traveled to Mollo Tanka. Chewbacca then rescued Tyra and took him back to Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, so they could rescue Solo. After they made their way to Mollo Tanka, Tyra stayed aboard the Falcon whilst Chewbacca rescued Solo, though when the two arrived back at where the Falcon had been parked, they discovered it was gone. Tyra, in possession of the urn, made his way to Iakar, and whilst waiting to speak with an Imperial supervisor, was arrested by Marshal Buck Vancto for various prior crimes. The marshal took Tyra to the Benelex Marshal Service Headquarters on Paqualis III, though the forces of Solo, Chewbacca, Greedo, and the crew of Khel Tanna arrived to extract Tyra. They successfully extracted Tyra, though Chewbacca was captured.",
