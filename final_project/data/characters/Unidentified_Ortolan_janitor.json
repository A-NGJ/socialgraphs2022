 "content": "An Ortolan male janitor worked in a spaceport on a green-skied planet in the year 19 BBY. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, the janitor was harassed by a pair of clone troopers searching for Senator Dewell Bronk on the planet. Bronk, who was on the world trying to flee from the planet Coruscant, saw the Ortolan being bullied and stepped into defend him. Recognizing their target, the clones then let the terrified Ortolan flee.\nThe Ortolan first appeared in \"Incognito,\" a short story by author John Jackson Miller and illustrated by Chris Scalf, which was published in Star Wars Insider 143 in 2013. The story served as a tie-in to Jackson's novel Kenobi, which was released later that year.",
