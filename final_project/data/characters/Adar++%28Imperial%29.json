 "content": "Adar was an Imperial Prefect during the Galactic Civil War.\nAdar accused bounty hunter Reson Nath of a variety of crimes and she was to be punished as according to the rules of Bounty Hunters' Guild. The trial was presided over by Janq Paramexor, and overseen by Moff Gorliz. Upon learning that the trial involved a battle with Nath, Adar quickly dropped the charges. However, Gorliz, who had bet on the outcome with Paramexor, ordered Adar to participate.\nAdar was a large man without much physical training, which made him realize that Nath would probably best, and possibly kill, him in battle.",
