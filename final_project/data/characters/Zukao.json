 "content": "Zukao was a male Bpfasshi who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was the brother of Fomadu, with whom he shared a strong Force bond. However, Zukao perished during the Bpfassh Uprising, and later Fomadu formed a new Force bond with a female Jensaarai named Mei. During the duel with Fomadu on Nar Shaddaa shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi used a Force illusion to briefly make himself look like Zukao after finding a cherished image in his opponent's mind. Fomadu was startled for a moment, and Kenobi managed to strike his opponent down.",
