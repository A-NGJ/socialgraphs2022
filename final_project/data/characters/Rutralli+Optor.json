 "content": "Rutralli Optor was a male Mon Calamari who led a rebel group in the Trax sector that was unaffiliated with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Optor led his group in hijacking the luxury liner Telgordo's Pride during the Galactic Civil War, marooning the majority of the crew and passengers. They headed to the planet Bundim, considered to be a safe port, with the intention of selling the Telgordo's Pride and purchasing smaller attack craft. However, Bundim was under Imperial occupation, forcing the group to pretend that nothing was wrong with the Telgordo's Pride; Optor instructed the crew to pose as the legitimate crew of the Telgordo's Pride, taking on passengers and crew to safely leave the system.",
