 "content": "Kahranna was a Human female who lived in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon of the planet Nal Hutta, in the year 3951 BBY. She and her family were refugees of the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War. Trapped on the moon by a transport pilot who dumped Kahranna and her kin there, she was desperate to get herself and her family off Nar Shaddaa and had paid a man named Planore to help her. When Planore did not come through on the deal, Kahranna was forced to beg and then rely on Meetra Surik, who was visiting the moon. She and her family were later transported to Telos IV after Surik spoke with the Ithorian courier Lasavvou about their plight.\nA Human female, Kahranna was a refugee displaced by the conflicts of the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War. She and her family lived in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa, the largest moon of Nal Hutta, during the year 3951 BBY. They had been abandoned on the so-called \"Smuggler's Moon\" by a pilot they had paid to transport them. Kahranna later spoke with a sentient named Planore, who offered to refer her and her family to a pilot friend of his for 50. Planore said that his friend would transport Kahranna and her family off-world for 500, but he had yet to come through on his offer.\nDuring that time, a former Jedi Knight Meetra Surik was visiting the moon in search of Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell. She spoke with Kahranna, who asked Surik if she was the spacer she was expecting. She was not, and Kahranna explained the situation with Planore to her, which Surik automatically expected was a scam and told Kahranna so. Upset by the news, she asked Surik for help, which the former Jedi Knight agreed to. Sometime later, Surik was able to convince an Ithorian courier named Lasavvou to provide Kahranna and her family with transportation to Telos IV in exchange for helping him pay his departure fee.\nKahranna loved her family and was desperate to see them off Nar Shaddaa and off to a better life somewhere else. While she was a bit naive in willing to trust a stranger on the Smuggler's Moon, she had expected it was a scam but was too desperate to turn down the opportunity to leave the moon. She had blonde hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nKahranna appears in the 2004 roleplaying video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. The player, cast as the Jedi Exile, may interact with and receive a quest from Kahranna while visiting Nar Shaddaa. While interaction or completion of Kahranna's quest is not absolutely required to further the game's plot, completing her quest will raise the Exchange criminal organization's notice of the player's activities on the moon, which is required to further the plot.\nA second option to complete the quest is to convince Fassa to provide transport for Kahranna and her family. The player can also tell her that they are the person she is expecting, and can convince her to handover the 500 credits for the transport, or tell her that the fees have increased to 800 credits, to which she will offer 600. Accepting any amount of credits from her results in dark side points. The Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide lists convincing Fassa to help Kahranna as the only outcome, but, with the release of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, the canon outcome was solidified as the one depicted in this article.",
