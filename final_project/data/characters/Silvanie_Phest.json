 "content": "Silvanie Phest was a female member of an Anomid colony that converted to become Disciples of the Whills shortly before the Battle of Yavin. In 0 BBY, she and several other members of her colony were present in Jedha City on the planet Jedha on the day that the city was destroyed by the Galactic Empire's Death Star. While she was on Jedha, Phest collected alms for the poor and concealed her body and face behind a red robe and a vocoder mask that converted her subvocal harmonics into audible speech.\nSilvanie Phest was one of a few Anomids that left their homeworld of Yablari to become a member of the Disciples of the Whills on Jedha. Because her species lacked vocal cords, Phest used a vocoder mask to communicate, giving her a delicate, singsong voice.\nIn the time before the Galactic Empire's occupation of Jedha, the singing of her prayers at the Temple of the Kyber would give pause to the Guardians of the Whills.\nSometime prior to the destruction of Jedha City by the Death Star, Phest and others gathered along the Old Shadows at the Temple of the Kyber helping those in need. When Wernad began falsely claiming to be a Jedi in order to spark a revolt against the Imperial occupation, she feared that this man's claims could result in violence from the stormtroopers. Thus, she sought the help of Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus. Îmwe agreed to help and followed Phest to the Old Shadows, followed by the reluctant Malbus. Phest listened as Îmwe talked with Wernad and joined the Guardian as he sat down prompting Wernard to keep the peace.\nSilvanie Phest collected alms for the poor in Jedha City prior to its destruction. The Imperials regularly searched her and other Anomids on Jedha for fear that fugitives were disguising themselves under their masks.\nSilvanie Phest first appeared in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. She was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was released the same day. Phest was portrayed by Stephanie Silva in the film. The character's name is similar to the actress' name.",
