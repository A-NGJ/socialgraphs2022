 "content": "In 17 ABY, a gray-haired Gotal visited the Crystal Jewel casino on Coruscant, the galactic capital, and entered into a game of sabacc against a Brubb, a Ssty and a Tin-Tin Dwarf. In one hand, the Gotal bet all that it owned, betraying its nervousness by shedding piles of hairâ€”a condition that most Gotals had learned to control. Shortly after the hand, an explosion went off in the nearby Senate Hall, which damaged the casino, leading to many of its patrons fleeing the premises.\nThe Gotal gambler appeared in the 1996 novel The New Rebellion, which was written by Kristine Kathryn Rusch.",
