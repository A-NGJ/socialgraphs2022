 "content": "Reiki was a male Zabrak who was part of an eight-man gang that crossed the Exchange sometime before their capture and incarceration by the Galactic Republic in the Belsavis prison. During the rioting that occurred when the Sith Empire attacked Belsavis, Reiki was one of many prisoners that escaped, but he was hunted down and killed by a bounty hunter fulfilling the Exchange's contract on the gang.",
