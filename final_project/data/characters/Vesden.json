 "content": "Imperial Navy trooper Vesden was a counterintelligence agent assigned by the Imperial Security Bureau to Endor. He operated sensors designed to protect the control bunker from infiltration. When the Endor strike team led by Han Solo broke into the shield generator bunker moments prior to the Battle of Endor, Major Hewex and his men were temporarily taken captive, including Fenson and Vesden. Eventually, reinforcements arrived and Hewex and his men were out of captivity. During the end of the forest battle, Vesden was taken captive by the Rebellion prior to the bunker's destruction.\nVesden first appeared as an unnamed extra in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Portrayed by an uncredited actor.",
