 "content": "A male Stormtrooper Commander of the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps was stationed on Lothal during an Empire Day celebration.\nStationed on the Outer Rim world of Lothal, the Stormtrooper Commander and a number of Imperial troops had been searching for the Rodian fugitive Tseebo, who had been carrying secret information. While Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios were distracting the crowd by hurling fireworks high up towards the sky, the commander was stationed at his post when he spotted Spectre Kanan Jarrus, who had just snuck under a TIE Advanced v1 by planting an explosive and tried to sneak away. He threatened to arrest Kanan since this area was off limits, but Kanan managed to fool the him by pretending that he was a drunk Imperial patriot excited by all the fireworks. When Ezra Bridger found Kanan and played along as his \"son,\" the stormtrooper allowed them to leave.\nThe Stormtrooper Commander is voiced by Steve Blum, who voiced Garazeb Orrelios in the television series Star Wars Rebels Season One.",
