 "content": "Danah Jor was a Human male Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY he came to the ruins of Taris to battle Force-sensitive nekghouls, only to discover that they were being trained in the Force by the holocron of the Jedi Bay-Yon Siu. Misguided, Siu ordered the nekghouls to imprison Jor, who remained restrained until a Republic hero came by and activated the holocron. Jor urged the Republic citizen to destroy nekghouls with a radiation spike, while the holocron Gatekeeper urged to let them stay and be trained in the Force. Ultimately, Danah Jor was freed from his cage and he and his rescuer departed the Temple ruins.\nDanah Jor is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Troy Hall.",
