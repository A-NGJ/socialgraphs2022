 "content": "Zeto was a male human gambler active during the Galactic Civil War. He podracers during the reign of the Galactic Empire on Nar Shaddaa. Zeto was increasingly frustrated by the five consecutive wins by racer Dooarix Gyll and hired , a Muun investigator to discover if they were cheating. When Feint pointed out that Gyll was using his companion Lisali Mitillan as a spotter, Zeto and his thugs confronted the pair and threatened them with a vibroblade. Mitillan used the Force to throw Zeto against a wall, knocking him unconscious. Geist used his own power of persuasion to send Zeto's hired hands running, though they dragged Zeto out of the garage without prompting.",
