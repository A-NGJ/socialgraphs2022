 "content": "Tendler Vek was a male Human gambler who cheated a group of nobles in the Core Worlds and was forced to flee to the Rim. He frequented the CrossWind Saloon in Storrd Township on Seregar.\nTendler was smooth, suave and well-groomed. He frequently puffed on a cigarra. Born in the Outer Rim Territories, he started out gambling after bad land deals bankrupted him and his family. He traveled through the Core Worlds, winning a fortune before suspicious nobles began to investigate him. He quickly fled, spending most of his wealth in the getaway.\nTendler was always friendly and had a positive outlook on life. He was not prone to violence, and preferred to know everything he could about a situation before proceeding.",
