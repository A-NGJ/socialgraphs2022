 "content": "Braxis was a male Pho Ph'eahian who served in the Imperial Senate during the early days of the Galactic Empire. The senator spoke to the newly declared head of the Empire, Emperor Palpatine, via hologram in 19 BBY, one month after the declaration of the New Order, while the latter was on the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant. During the exchange, Braxis sought aid for the planet he represented, which Palpatine had previously promised him, though the Emperor denied the aid on the grounds that he could not intervene in local politics. Braxis protested, but was cut off before he could finish as the Emperor turned off the hologram.\nBraxis first appeared in the comic book series Star Wars: Dark Times in the first issue of the Path to Nowhere story arc published on November 8, 2006. The comic was written by Mick Harrison, a pen name of Randy Stradley, and was illustrated by Douglas Wheatley.",
