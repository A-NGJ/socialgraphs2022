 "content": "Ananda Dwyce was a Human female who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Ananda made a decision to flee Bestine and join the Rebel Alliance since she saw how evil the Empire was. Wilhalm Skrim sent a spacer to find Ananda and arrest her before she could escape the planet. The spacer successfully found Ananda who was been escorted by two Rebels. The spacer immediately killed the two escorts and spared Ananda. She was apprehended and later executed by the Empire.\nAnanda Dwyce was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
