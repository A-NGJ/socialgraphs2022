 "content": "A clone trooper lieutenant who served as an ARF trooper was tasked with tracking down Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son.\nAfter Jabba the Hutt's son was kidnapped by Count Dooku, he was sent to track down the kidnapped Hutt. After following hired bounty hunters that were contracted by Jabba the Hutt, he and his squad discovered that the Hutt was sent to a B'omarr Order monastery on the planet of Teth. He contacted Jedi General Mace Windu, and told him that the monastery was too heavily fortified for his squad to go in alone.\nAfterward, once Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's fleet entered the Teth system, he reported to General Skywalker that there were at least two droid battalions protecting the monastery, and that he would not be able to land there.\nHe wore a suit of light-weight recon armor made of plastoid material, equipped with surveillance gear. His armor was camouflaged to blend in with the environment of the planet Teth.\nThe lieutenant was referred to by Mace Windu as \"Commander\". In the DVD's subtitles, this lieutenant's line is erroneously attributed to Rex.",
