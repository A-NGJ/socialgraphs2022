 "content": "Banna was a male Human pilot and slicer in the New Republic Starfighter Corps during the Galactic Civil War. In 7 ABY, Commander Wedge Antilles began forming a new X-wing squadron that would be as capable in commando missions on the ground as they were in a starfighter. When recruiting for this squadron, Antilles wanted candidates who were experienced pilots that no other commanders wanted; pilots known for causing trouble or making grave mistakes. Banna was one such pilot and agreed to try out for the squadron. A decent but not extraordinary slicer, Banna was caught slicing his test scores to improve them during the initial training and culling process for the candidates at the New Republic's Folor Base training facility, and he was removed from the program the next day.\nBanna was mentioned in the fifth novel of the X-wing series, X-Wing: Wraith Squadron, written by Aaron Allston and published on February 2, 1998.",
