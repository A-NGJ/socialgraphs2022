 "content": "An Ewok female was the grandmother of the Ewok Teebo, who lived in Bright Tree Village on the Forest Moon of Endor. In 3 ABY, while playing a game of drop-the-sack, where his Ewok friends tried to drop a sack on his head, Teebo was unimpressed with their throwing abilities, jokingly comparing them to that of his grandmother.\nTeebo's grandmother was mentioned in \"The Cries of the Trees,\" the first episode of the first season of the animated series Ewoks, which was written by Paul Dini and aired on September 7, 1985.",
