 "content": "A male Twi'lek scoundrel participated in an ambush set up for Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian in the Bespin settlement of Cloud City in 1 ABY. The Twi'lek and some other fringers accompanied the bounty hunter Bossk, who had been hired by the settlement's former owner, Dominic Raynor, after he accused Calrissian of cheating in the sabacc game in which he lost the city. After faking an emergency call, the scoundrels lured Calrissian to one of the city's maintenance levels, where Calrissian was attacked by the Twi'lek and his companions before fleeing the ambush through a hangar.\nA male Twi'lek lived and worked as a scoundrel in 1 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War. In that year, Cloud City Baron Administrator Dominic Raynor gambled away his Bespin mining settlement in a game against the professional sabacc player Lando Calrissian. Thinking that his opponent had cheated, Raynor hired the bounty hunter Bossk to capture or kill Calrissian, who had become the new Baron Administrator. With the knowledge that his target would be well protected, Bossk contacted some mercenaries and cutthroats, including a Duros, a Quarren assassin, two Twi'lek scoundrels—this individual and a colleague of the same species—to assist him.\nThe Twi'lek and his companions slipped through the security of Cloud City and planned an ambush to capture Calrissian. Bossk impersonated the city's chief engineer and reported to Calrissian that a primary repulsorlift pod was about to break down—a failure that would destroy the floating city. In response, Calrissian went to the city's lower levels to check the pod, accompanied by his Twi'lek bodyguard and four Bespin Wing Guards as a precautionary measure.\nBossk ordered his companions to take cover but remain in sight to lure Calrissian out. Since they were unsure which turbolift Calrissian would arrive in, the Twi'lek and the others spread into every room near the lifts. After Calrissian's group entered the maintenance level, a blast door suddenly shut behind them, and the ad hoc bounty hunter group opened fire on the Baron Administrator's guards. With a long dagger, the Twi'lek engaged his opponents, who decided to hold their enemies off while the Baron Administrator escaped through a nearby hangar. Thanks to the distress call sent by a member of Calrissian's party, a quartet of Wing Guards arrived to assist the Baron Administrator, who successfully managed to flee from the ambush.\nThe Twi'lek appeared in Sore Loser's Revenge, a Wizards.com online roleplaying scenario written by Eric Cagle for the Star Wars Miniatures collectible tabletop strategy game in 2004. During the game, one player controls Calrissian's party, and another controls Bossk's party, including the Twi'lek, who is represented by a generic Twi'lek Scoundrel miniature figurine from the Miniatures set Rebel Storm. The survival of the character depends on the players' actions. In an alternate ending to the scenario, the Twi'lek's party kills Calrissian's escorts and captures the Baron Administrator, but the short story Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array has rendered this ending non-canonical by featuring Calrissian free and unharmed a few days after Bossk's ambush.",
