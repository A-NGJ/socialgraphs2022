 "content": "Ola Hest was an Ottegan female criminal who lived during the High Republic Era. She spent thirty years working as an enforcer for the Hutts. At some point she was sent to collect protection money from a children's medcenter on Novor, when the Sisters of the Ninth Plane who ran the medcenter refused to pay, she turned her frigate's thrusters on the sanctuary and brought it down, killing all in the building, though Hest later claimed it was an accident. \nHest was eventually tracked to Gardulla's Palace by the Blade of Bardotta, where she was captured and imprisoned aboard the Galactic Republic prison ship Restitution. Hest managed to attain power aboard the Restitution, and had outside contacts to a network of assassins and bounty hunters, and fellow prisoners Muglan and Parr as her bodyguards. \nAfter Lourna Dee, Tempest Runner of the Nihil marauder organization, was imprisoned on the Restitution, with the Republic unaware of her identity, she came into conflict with Hest. When the prison ship was attacked by former Nihil Tempest Runner Pan Eyta, who sought revenge on Dee, Hest was killed by Eyta after attempting to deliver Dee to her rival.\nOla Hest was voiced by Orlagh Cassidy in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott.",
