 "content": "Robbyn Sark was the Roshan delegate chosen to go to Samaria and speak with Bog Divinian, the Imperial governor, about his charges of all kinds against Rosha and its people. He escaped the planet when it was under attack with the help of Ferus Olin, but was killed by the Empire when he arrived back at Rosha. The HoloNet showed his burning carcass by a destroyed landspeeder.",
