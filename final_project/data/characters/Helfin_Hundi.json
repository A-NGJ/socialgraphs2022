 "content": "Helfin Hundi was a Nikto who operated in Coronet City, Corellia sometime after 0 BBY. An information broker, he was engaged in selling Imperial shipping manifests to the Rebellion. He was arrested by a bounty hunter working on behalf of Captain Gilad Pellaeon.\nHelfin Hundi was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. In the game, his species was randomly generated each time a player performed the quest, but the Squadrons Over Corellia card established him as a Nikto.",
