 "content": "Edwig was a female human who served in the Imperial Security Bureau, a law enforcement and intelligence agency of the Galactic Empire. Towards the end of the Galactic Civil War, she served as flag lieutenant to Admiral Firmus Piett of Fleet Command.\nOn Piett's behalf, she issued a transmission to all fleet and garrison commanders, warning them that enemy espionage was probable, and that all information security categories were to be increased by one full level. The transmission itself was later intercepted by the Rebellion.",
