 "content": "Rosh Rendar was a Human male Corellian criminal who was active as a saboteur during the Clone Wars.\nSometime during the war, Rosh was a known saboteur who committed 87 deaths conscience, although he maintained himself to be innocent. Along with 49 dangerous criminals that were captured by the Republic, Rosh was to be sent to Coruscant. While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi Knights. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Rosh was among the prisoners to cooperate with the Jedi and helped repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid would affect their parole.",
