 "content": "Rhys was a male Human who served as a sergeant in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war he worked as a light armor merchant on the planet Corellia where he ran a stall within the Republic controlled Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport. Rhys had red hair, green eyes and fair skin. While at his stall he wore a white, blue and brown uniform including a helmet.\nSergeant Rhys appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Light Armor Vendor for Republic players on Corellia. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Rhys was removed from the game along with the rest of the Light Armor Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
