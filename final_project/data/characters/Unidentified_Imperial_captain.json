 "content": "A human male captain served in a Galactic Empire remnant led by Moff Gideon. He commanded an Imperial Gozanti-class Assault Carrier, which was attacked above the moon Trask in 9 ABY by four Mandalorians led by Bo-Katan Kryze. The captain sealed himself in the bridge as stormtroopers defended the hallways, being swiftly eliminated. He soon had the Gozanti assault carrier begin its ascent from Trask.\nAfter the Mandalorians took control of the cargo bay, the captain threatened to hunt them down if they stowed away with crates. He then contacted Gideon, requesting help from the moff. Gideon, though, ordered him to sacrifice himself and the Gozanti. Thus the captain killed his officers in the bridge and began flying the assault carrier straight towards Trask. However, the Mandalorians stopped him and Kryze interrogated the man for the location of Gideon. The captain subsequently killed himself using a suicide shocker in his mouth.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, the captain served in a remnant led by Moff Gideon. In 9 ABY, He commanded an Imperial Gozanti-class Assault Carrier which went to the estuary moon of Trask in the Kol Iben system to export weapons from a black market port, paid for with stolen resources from the planet Mandalore. The Gozanti Assault Carrier was attacked a number of times by a trio of Mandalorians, Bo-Katan Kryze, Koska Reeves and Axe Woves, and the crew made sure to scan for life forms as a precaution before the assault carrier's scheduled departure.\nThe Gozanti set off at the start of the day, cruising along a shipping lane in preparation to ascend from Trask. However, Kryze, Reeves and Woves attacked the assault carrier, accompanied by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. As the four Mandalorians fought the stormtroopers on the outside walkways of the Gozanti, the captain made his way to the bridge, where the ship's security officer informed him of the situation. A stormtrooper from outside then dropped onto the bridge window, and the captain ordered that the hall to the bridge be guarded with the door sealed.\nThe Mandalorians made it inside the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier and began eliminating more stormtroopers. The captain asked for an update, wishing to know the number of attackers. Although a stormtrooper reported at least ten attackers over comms, the security officer claimed that only four enemy life forms were present, and the stormtrooper identified the Mandalorians before being killed. The captain inquired on when the assault carrier would manage to leave into hyperspace. After the ship's pilot informed him that they were not allowed to ascend yet, the captain forcibly had the Gozanti assault carrier begin climbing altitude immediately.\nThe Mandalorians headed towards the cargo bay, where the ship's deck officer was instructed by the captain to hold the infiltrators off until the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier entered hyperspace. The captain then listened over the comms as the deck officer had his stormtroopers trap the Mandalorians by closing the doors. The deck officer informed the man that the enemies were trapped in the cargo control area. The captain realized that the Mandalorians could now use the cargo control area, but it was too late as the deck officer and his troops were flushed out of the assault carrier when the Mandalorians opened the cargo bay doors.\nThe security officer reached out to the cargo bay, and Kryze responded, bragging about what the Mandalorians could do with the weapons they were seizing. The captain threatened to hunt the infiltrators down if they stole any crates, but his adversary stated her intention to take over the whole of the assault carrier. Thus the man contacted Gideon, informing the moff of the ongoing attack and requesting for backup. After the captain specified how much of the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier had been taken, Gideon implicitly ordered him to sacrifice the vessel. The captain complied with Gideon's order and shot the pilot and security officer with his SE-14r light repeating blaster.\nTaking the pilot controls, the captain forced the Gozanti assault carrier into a nose dive straight towards Trask's surface. The Mandalorians, though, reached the bridge, Djarin grabbing the man from his seat and taking the pilot controls with Reeves. As the two Mandalorians flew the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier back to level altitude, Kryze held the captain at knife point, demanding to know if Gideon had the Darksaber, an ancient lightsaber used as a symbol of leadership in Mandalorian culture. The man assured her she already knew, and Kryze promised to let him live if he led her to the moff. However, the captain claimed that Gideon would not let him live, and forcibly gnashed his teeth, activating a suicide shocker that killed him.\nThe captain was a human male with light skin, grey hair, and blue eyes. Upon learning that his Gozanti-class Assault Carrier was being attacked, he had the bridge sealed and the hallways guarded to preserve his safety. When the Mandalorians continued to break through waves of stormtroopers, the captain frequently asked for updates from his officers and rushed the assault carrier into beginning its ascent early. The man advised the deck officer and his troops to buy time for the Gozanti assault carrier to escape, and took a moment to realize when the deck officer had accidentally given the Mandalorians control of the cargo bay doors. After hearing the officer and his troopers get flushed out from the assault carrier, the captain nervously swallowed.\nWhen Bo-Katan Kryze took control of the cargo bay, the captain claimed that he would hunt the Mandalorian and her accomplices if they stole from the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier. With the infiltrators having taken a large portion of the assault carrier, the captain reached out to Gideon for help. Having then been ordered by the moff to sacrifice himself and the Gozanti assault carrier, the man complied and killed his two officers in the bridge to take the pilot controls. In response to Bo-Katan Kryze's promise to let him live if he led her to Gideon, the captain, knowing that Gideon would kill him regardless, committed suicide.\nThe captain wore the standard uniform of an Imperial naval command officer, including an Imperial kepi and a code cylinder attached below each shoulder. He wore a rank insignia plaque on his left breast with three red bars above three blue. The captain used an SE-14r light repeating blaster to shoot his two officers in the bridge and eventually committed suicide using an electric shock mechanism in his mouth that he could activate by forcibly gnashing his teeth.\nThe captain appeared in \"Chapter 11: The Heiress\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Bryce Dallas Howard and released on November 13, 2020. Credited as \"captain,\" he was played by Titus Welliver with Con Schell serving as the stunt double.",
