 "content": "Marsune was a male Otolla Gungan who lived on the planet Naboo in the year 3000 BBY. During a period of war between the Gungan tribes at that time, Marsune formed a rogue gang and gained a reputation among the Gungans as a thief who would steal from the greedier Bosses and distribute their wealth among the poorer tribes. While spending time in his forest base, Marsune encountered Boss Gallo, who had escaped the destruction of his city, Otoh Sancture, at the hands of a clan of bursas, a semi-sentient carniverous species native to Naboo. Marsune, wishing to avoid being caught up in the war, agreed to only exchange four worker Glurrgs for five nerfs Gallo had found in the forest.\nGallo went into the forest and raised a small army able to attack the bursas that had destroyed Otoh Sancture, and upon finishing the task encountered Marsune again, who had changed his mind about the situation and wanted to help Gallo. The two Gungans then began a crusade to unite the warring tribes and defeat Rogoe, the warlord who had secretly arranged Otoh Sancture's destruction. Marsune and Gallo traveled to each of the major Gungan cities, and completed several different tasks to secure their allegiance. Eventually Gallo prepared for an assault on Rogoe's city, Spearhead, and Marsune turned the tide of the attack by recruiting the Bongomeken Collective, a company that made bongo submarines, which were necessary to attack the underwater portion of Spearhead. Rogoe was killed in the battle and Spearhead was rebuilt by Gallo as Otoh Gunga, and Marsune was appointed as the first captain in Gallo's new Grand Army. Marsune and Gallo were remembered as heroes by generations of Gungans that came after them.\nMarsune was a male Otolla Gungan who lived on the planet Naboo in the year 3000 BBY during a long period of war between the Gungan tribes. In this time Marsune became a folk hero to the local Gungans, gaining a widespread reputation for stealing the riches of the greedier Bosses and distributing them amongst the poorer citizens. The Gungan also led a small gang of fellow rogue Gungans, who spent most of their time hiding in Naboo's swamps and forests, and also had a base hidden near the city Otoh Sancture. Marsune spent most of the Gungan war in a relatively isolated existence until Gallo, the Boss of Otoh Sancture, found Marsune's base following his city's destruction by bursas, a dangerous semi-sentient species on Naboo. The creatures had been sent by Rogoe, a Gungan warlord secretly manipulating the conflict between the Gungan tribes for his own benefit, who wanted to kill Gallo as he was one of the more powerful Bosses and if he decided to join could change the tide of the war. Marsune desired to stay out of the war, and so only agreed to trade five nerfs, an edible animal species, from Gallo, in exchange for four Glurrgs, a non-sentient species useful as laborers. Gallo consented to the deal and left Marsune's base with the Glurrgs, and as he explored the forest later he discovered that Rogoe was behind the destruction of his city, prompting the Boss to raise a small army to attack the bursas who had nested on Otoh Sancture's remains.\nAfter Gallo was victorious in slaying the bursas Marsune went to the ruins of Otoh Sancture and agreed to join the boss's campaign against Rogoe, as the revelation of the warlord's hand in Otoh Sancture's destruction rankled Marsune's sense of honor. Marsune partnered with Gallo as he traveled through the warring Gungan cities and made efforts to unite them to his cause. With the Gungan tribes united in a Grand Army, Marsune participated in the Raid on Spearhead, a major assault on Rogoe's fortress city Spearhead. The captain informed Gallo that the army would be unable to take Spearhead without an underwater force, and Gallo tasked Marsune with traveling to the base of the Bongomeken Collective to acquire the necessary vessels. Marsune succeeded and Rogoe and his army were ultimately destroyed, with Gallo pledging to rebuild Spearhead as Otoh Gunga, a symbol of Gungan unity. The two leaders became legendary figures in Gungan history, with children recreating their adventures in the game \"Marsune and Gallo\" on Naboo's forests and swamps.\nMarsune had a reputation as a rogue and a thief, although he had noble intentions by redistributing the wealth to poorer Gungans. When Gallo came to Marsune for help, the captain rejected his plea to avenge Otoh Sancture, mockingly referring to it as a \"grand quest\" and laughing. Upon learning of Rogoe's involvement Marsune had a change of heart, becoming a steadfast supporter of Gallo and believing in the morality of their cause.\nMarsune rode a kaadu during the war between the Gungans.\nMarsune was first mentioned in Prima Games strategy guide for the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, before appearing in the game on its release. Marsune was voiced by David Jeremiah.",
