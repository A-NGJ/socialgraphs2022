 "content": "Chackron Nasplek was an Mon Calamari who started a courier delivery service sometime after the Galactic Civil War.\nBreaking with family tradition, Nasplek chose not to join the forces of the New Republic, but instead to start his own business in Kee-Piru. However, the city was destroyed by the Empire's World Devastators during the Battle of Calamari. Luckily, Nasplek was on another system at the time of the attack, but lost all of his assets in the attack. He eventually re-established his business and it soon expanded beyond Mon Calamari.",
