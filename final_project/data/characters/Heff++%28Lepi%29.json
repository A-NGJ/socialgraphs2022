 "content": "Heff was a male Lepi who emigrated to Tatooine on one of the original colony ships that settled the planet in the early period of the Galactic Empire. There, he set up a shop known as Heff's Souvenirs, which he ran with his daughter Tebbi. Heff lived to be one of only three remaining colonists from those early ships.\nIn 0 ABY, Heff was killed by the bounty hunter Jodo Kast who shot him in the neck with a sennari-poisoned dart. Kast was seeking the Rebel sympathizer Adar Tallon who had been hiding out on the planet for many years. Kast slowly killed off all those that may have been alive when Tallon arrived to ensure they couldn't pass on any information to competing hunters. Upon his death, Tebbi—herself a Rebel sympathizer—shared what she could with a group of Rebels that were also seeking Tallon. After a couple of seasons, she sold Heff's Souvenirs to the Sullustan Moplin Jarron.\nHeff and his daughter were described in Tatooine Manhunt as \"rabbit-like alien.\" The name \"Heff\" was later used in the The Starhoppers of Aduba-3 article as an example of a Lepi name, and in this manner his species was revealed.",
