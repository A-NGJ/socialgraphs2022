 "content": "Odie Subu was a Human female who served as a reconnaissance trooper in the Praesitlyn Defense Force. She was slightly younger than Anakin Skywalker. Odie and Lieutenant Erk H'Arman were the sole survivors of the defense force over Praesitlyn that had been commanded by General Khamar.\nDuring the Battle of Praesitlyn, she and H'Arman fought against the Separatist droid army with Freedom's Sons and a task force commanded by Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon and future Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. After returning from her mission with H'Arman, she was startled by the returning reconnaissance crew she accidentally blasted a Rodian named Grudo, believing he was the enemy. He died later that day. After their victory, Subu and H'Arman were married and, at Subu's request, Skywalker agreed to preside over the ceremony.",
