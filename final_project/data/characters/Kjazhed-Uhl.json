 "content": "Kjazhed-Uhl was a Human male stormtrooper stationed under Darth Vader in the Galactic Empire. Sometime between 0 ABY 3 ABY, Kjazhed-Uhl encountered his fellow stormtrooper Bob during a lunch break, where Bob revealed he had stolen the diary of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. After some persuading from Bob, Kjazhed-Uhl agreed to read the diary with him where they learned more about Vader's private thoughts. Kjazhed-Uhl felt sorry for Vader by the time they finished reading.\nKjazhed-Uhl was a Human male who left his home to serve as a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire, who was familiar with fellow stormtrooper Bob. He had a sister, who, sometime between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, gave birth to a child that was both a boy and a girl. Kjazhed-Uhl planned to return home over a weekend to visit his sister and the baby. On a day prior to the weekend, Kjazhed-Uhl encountered Bob on his lunch break in the mess hall, and Bob asked about his weekend plans. Kjazhed-Uhl explained his weekend plans, and Bob revealed that he had stolen the diary of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, which he planned to read. Kjazhed-Uhl chastised Bob for his action, believing Vader would kill him if he found out.\nBob stated that he could read the diary undetected, as Vader was away for the weekend, and Kjazhed-Uhl relented and sat down to read it with Bob. The first page they read featured a passage about Vader receiving a new helmet, where Bob noted that he had mispelled \"nightmare\" as \"nitemare.\" Kjazhed-Uhl disputed Bob's claim, saying it was a word with multiple spellings like \"nucular.\" The stormtroopers glared at each other before skipping to a different section, where Vader recorded his feelings about Luke Skywalker. Kjazhed-Uhl misread the name and asked aloud who \"Luke Skywalter\" was, and Bob guessed that he was Vader's son based on the writing.\nBob noticed several poor quality illustrations by Vader of him committing acts of violence, which Kjazhed-Uhl leaned over to see. He considered the drawings weird, and was asked by Bob if he drew in his own diary. Kjazhed-Uhl responded that he kept a journal, not a diary. He then suggested that they flip through to see if they were mentioned, and Bob skipped through other sections to find one about stormtroopers. They discovered a section where Vader recorded an emotional breakdown involving his birthday being forgotten, where he also wrote that he would kill anyone who read it. Kjazhed-Uhl sarcastically commented that it was swell for them to have uncovered that passage.\nBob said that he never realized Vader had a birthday, and Kjazhed-Uhl repled that it was obvious as everyone had a birthday. When prompted, Kjazhed-Uhl speculated that Vader's first name was Corey. Bob believed that Vader needed to deal with his emotions through therapy or a creative outlet, which Kjazhed-Uhl disagreed with. He stated that Vader needed to confront his issues head on, and admitted that he felt partially sorry for the Sith. An alarm sounded afterwards, and another stormtrooper informed Bob and Kjazhed-Uhl that Vader had called an emergency meeting. The stormtroopers put on their helmets to attend the meeting, where Vader explained that there was an intruder aboard who was to be brought to Vader immediately once caught. After the meeting, one of the stormtroopers walked up to Vader and quietly wished him a happy birthday, giving him pause.\nKjazhed-Uhl initially considered Bob foolish for stealing Vader's diary, but agreed to read it after being assured they wouldn't be caught, considering it a shame not to. He considered diaries and journals distinct items, and thought Vader's illustrations were weird. After reading the account of Vader's birthday, Kjazehd-Uhl felt a level of pity for Vader, and suggested that confronting his issues head on could resolve his emotional issues. Kjazhed-Uhl had black balding hair, fair skin, and blue eyes.\nKjazhed-Uhl wore white stormtrooper armor and was equipped with a blaster. He ate a sandwich during his lunch break.\nKjazhed-Uhl appeared in \"Lunch Break,\" a comic written and illustrated by Jonathan Adams and released in the sixteenth issue of Star Wars Tales, published on June 25, 2003.",
