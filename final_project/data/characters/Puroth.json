 "content": "Puroth was a four-armed female Eirrauc Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Eirrauc, Puroth received training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order before ascending to the rank of Jedi Master. Having constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber, which she wielded in one of her four hands, Master Puroth selected the Initiate Nystammall as her Padawan. Training him to the rank of Jedi Knight, Master Puroth worked with him well after his leaving her tutelage.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Puroth took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. Leading clone troopers in the war, Puroth continued to work with her former Padawan on many missions. Together, the pair were dispatched to the planet Tovarskl where they were assigned to defend the Republic from the Separatist Droid Army. Encountering the leader of the Separatist army, General Grievous, Master Puroth engaged the Kaleesh cyborg in a lightsaber duel; because she could match Grievous while wielding four lightsabers at once, she proved to be one of the General's most challenging opponents. However, Grievous eventually dismembered and killed Puroth. He then took her lightsaber as a prize, adding it to his collection of Jedi weapons.\nPuroth's lightsaber was used by Grievous in battle with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Utapau. During Kenobi's battle with the cyborg, he was able to remove the hand that wielded Master Puroth's weapon.",
