 "content": "A female Colicoid was queen of a Colicoid nest at some point in time. She served as the queen of the nest inhabited by the future Nihil Storm Jinnix and his dronemate. The Hueche once raided their nest, and Jinnix's dronemate failed to protect the queen. When they explained the reasons they couldn't protect her to Jinnix, he ripped off their head and ate their ganglia.\nThe Colicoid queen was mentioned in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast.",
