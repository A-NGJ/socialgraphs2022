 "content": "Antoll Jellrek was a Human male Imperial Moff who administered the Galov sector in the Outer Rim Territories during the Galactic Civil War. He was tall and pale and sported a forked beard.\nJellrek was ruthless and brutal, but gladly accepted tribute from the crime lords of his sector in return for not mingling with their operations. He was involved in illegal ryll and slave trade and was rumored to have several slave girls in his private estate on Romar. Jellrek had a taste for both physical and psychological torture, being especially merciless to enemies of the Empire such as the Rebels. He was killed after Platt Okeefe and Tru'eb Cholakk killed Quintik Kahr during their escape from slavery.",
