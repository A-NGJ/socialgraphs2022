 "content": "By't Distombe was a male Twi'lek podracer. He participated in such high-tier podracer competitions as the Phoebos Memorial Run and the Vinta Harvest Classic. During the Fifth Elimination Finals of the Vinta Harvest, By't was struck in the head by a bottle of Vinta Harvest Ale tossed by Sebulba. As a result, the Twi'lek lost control over a methane pool. His cockpit exploded when it collided with a pillar of gas.\nIn 32 BBY, By't Distombe was one of the podracers that participated in the Phoebos Memorial Run and the Vinta Harvest Classic on the planet Malastare. These were large-scale pod races, in which the race included the Dug Sebulba. In the final round of the fifth race of the competitions, Distombe decided to take a shortcut over a gas crater. When he was overtaken by Sebulba, he was suddenly struck in the head by a bottle by the cheating Dug, causing the Twi'lek to lose control of his machine, which exploded shortly thereafter.",
