During the war he was stationed on the planet Ord Mantell, where a civil war had broken out between the Republic backed Ord Mantell Central Authority and the Mantellian Separatist Movement. Hurwell was posted on the outskirts of the Republic held Fort Garnik on Avilatan island, where he operated a stall from which he sold various specialty goods. While at his stall Hurwell wore white and blue armor. He had fair skin, red hair and blue eyes.\nHurwell first appeared in the 2011 MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare.
