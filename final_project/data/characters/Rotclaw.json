 "content": "Rotclaw was a particularly large and dangerous bloodclaw mouf that lived in a group of moufs on the High Grounds of the Rryatt Trail on Kashyyyk.\nRotclaw was a creature in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. It could be found on the High Grounds level of the Rryatt Trail. It was a level 56 Gold Chevron elite, which meant that it was much stronger and tougher than normal moufs and even posed a threat to players with higher levels. It was not involved in any quest, but the players had to cross the area where Rotclaw and a group of other moufs could be found in order to reach the next level of the Rryatt trail.",
