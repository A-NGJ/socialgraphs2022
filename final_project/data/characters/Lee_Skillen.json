 "content": "Lee Skillen was a Karkarodon female who resided on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. She worked for Ohnaka Transport Solutions, a company founded by the former pirate Hondo Ohnaka, supervising the business when its owner was off-world. Both the pressure of the job and Skillen's personal life gave her stress, making her often agitated. Around 34 ABY, the farmer Julen Rakab attempted to convince Skillen to allow him to retrieve a parcel, intended for the collector Dok-Ondar, which had been delivered to Ohnaka Transport Solutions after a mix-up with another parcel. Skillen refused to let the parcel leave the company's office, so Rakab stole her access card, and his friend Izal Garsea entered the office to find the parcel.\nBorn on an aquatic world, Lee Skillen eventually traveled the galaxy, settling in the town of Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. By the time that Skillen resided on Batuu, she had a Twi'lek girlfriend, whom Skillen's mother disliked due to her species.\nBy around 34 ABY, Skillen was employed by Ohnaka Transport Solutions, a transport company founded by the former pirate Hondo Ohnaka, working as a supervisor for the company while Ohnaka was off-world. The pressure of Skillen's work gave her stress, due to vendors in Black Spire Outpost demanding their goods and merchandise. During her first week on the job, Skillen mistakenly sent a crate of worms to the planet Urajab instead of its intended destination, causing the planet's jungles to be reduced to weeds by the new invasive species.\nDuring one particularly stressful day of her work, Skillen was approached by one of the company's pilots, who wished to complain about the state of the starship he had to fly and the skills of the copilots that the company assigned him. Dismissing the pilot, Skillen sent the protocol droid G1-MD to handle the pilot's issues. When the pilot had gone, the farmer Julen Rakab spoke to Skillen, regarding an issue with a parcel he had delivered to the company earlier that day. While Rakab had accidentally given the company the wrong parcel, which was intended for the collector Dok-Ondar, Skillen did not allow him to retrieve it, stating that nothing left the office once it had been delivered.\nAs Skillen and Rakab talked, Rakab's friend Izal Garsea, who was meant to deliver the parcel to Dok-Ondar, bumped into them wearing a cloak, attempting to steal Skillen's access card. However, Rakab had already stolen the card, but Skillen was unaware. Believing that she had changed Rakab's mind, Skillen walked away from the office. However, Rakab and Garsea waited for the next shift switch aboard a nearby freighter, after which Garsea entered the office using Skillen's card.\nAs Garsea searched for her parcel, Skillen arrived at the office, assuming she had lost her access card. Skillen used the door's override code to unlock the office, leading the Ohnaka Transport Solutions employee Delta Jeet inside while Garsea hid beneath a stack of urusida pelts. Skillen instructed Jeet, who was irritated at having to work on her week off due to another employee quitting, to organize parcels destined for Corellia and Clak'dor. Jeet reluctantly accepted the extra work, and Skillen left the office. Shortly afterwards, Skillen was surrounded by a number of irate pilots.\nA Karkarodon female, Skillen had rough blue skin and black eyes. Standing two meters tall, Skillen was an intimidating figure. She used her appearance to her advantage, intimidating others to follow her orders without complaint.\nThe constant pressure of working for Ohnaka Transport Solutions gave Skillen considerable stress and lowered her patience, as did several aspects of her personal life. When Skillen began speaking, she often unloaded a stream of information, particularly about the difficulties she faced. When thanking employee Delta Jeet for taking extra work, Skillen spoke as if she was reciting a script.\nAs a member of an aquatic species, Skillen wore a habitat-regulating bodysuit while on land, which released vapor that prevented her body from drying out. While supervising Ohnaka Transport Solutions, Skillen carried a datapad. When speaking with Skillen, Rakab glanced at the datapad, noticing it was turned off, and believed Skillen was only carrying it to look busy so others would leave her alone. Skillen also owned an access card for the office at Ohnaka Transport Solutions, which was stolen by Rakab in order to retrieve the parcel he accidentally delivered.\nLee Skillen appeared in A Crash of Fate, a novel written by Zoraida CÃ³rdova and published in 2019.",
