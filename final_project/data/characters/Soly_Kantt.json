 "content": "Soly Kantt was a male Human who lived with his family on Corellia. Kantt worked at Orbital Assembly Facility 7 for the Corellian Engineering Corporation, which he had been with since 70 BBY. In 60 BBY, he was on shift at Orbital 7 when the Millennium Falcon, at the time designated YT 492727ZED, wrought havoc on the assembly line during testing as a result of a fuel droid failing to detach in time and overfilling the YT-1300's fuel cells.",
