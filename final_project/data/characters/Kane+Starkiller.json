 "content": "Kane Starkiller was the Jedi father of Annikin Starkiller and his brother Deak Starkiller. His homeworld was Aquilae.\nKane Starkiller fled to the Fourth Moon of Utapau after the Knights of Sith supplanted the Jedi-Bendu as bodyguards to the Galactic Emperor. When the Galactic Empire arrived at Utapau, he was forced to flee, and his son Deak was killed.\nKane asked General Luke Skywalker to take Annikin as his Padawan. He could not instruct his son in the Force because he was a cyborg, though he had kept this a secret even from his family. Only his head and right arm were organic. He was dying because his mechanical replacements were slowly failing. He sacrificed himself in Gordon by donating the energy pack which powered his electronic heart, which the heroes needed to power the freighter and hibernation chambers required to reach the Forbidden Systems.",
