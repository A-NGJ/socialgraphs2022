 "content": "Jarkyc was a male Mandalorian who resided in the planet of Mandalore in 19 BBY. He wore a deep brown armor and his knuckles were tattooed with Mando'a runes.\nShortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire when an Imperial garrison was established on Mandalore, Jarkyc and his companion Hayar managed to convince the Imperial garrison commander that a failed theme park, built by Hayar's brother, was a sacred Mandalorian temple. Intending to inspire awe among the local populace, the theme park was bought by the Empire which was used as their garrison base. Jarkyc then related the whole story as a joke on the Oyu'baat, where former Jedi Bardan Jusik and Null ARC Ordo Skirata listened to the story.",
