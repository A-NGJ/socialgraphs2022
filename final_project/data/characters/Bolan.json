 "content": "Bolan was a male Nikto slicer active during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He had an eccentric personality and knew how to speak Galactic Basic Standard due to chips he implanted in his own brain. He was a leader of a techno-criminal group of Niktos known as the Circle, which was employed by Darth Zash before being imprisoned on Belsavis by the Galactic Republic. Bolan and the Circle were freed during the Invasion of Belsavis around 3641 BBY, yet remained on the planet due to the technological opportunities on the Rakatan world. The Force-walker Kallig approached them later during the war where the Nikto assisted the ill Lord of the Sith find the Mother Machine in exchange for the Sith planting communication links between Belsavis and the wider galaxy in order to further the criminal organization's influence.",
