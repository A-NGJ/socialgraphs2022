 "content": "Visaiya was a female human who served as an adviser to Her Majesty Breha Organa, Queen of Alderaan. As such, she would notably remind the queen of her schedule for the day. In truth, Queen Breha regarded her as more than just an aide, but as a friend. Visaiya was so important to Organa that the queen often joked that losing her would be like cutting off a hand. As a symbol of their friendship, the two even had matching silver rings they each wore on their right index fingers.",
