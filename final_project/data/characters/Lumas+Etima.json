 "content": "Lumas Etima was a male Human Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Separatist Crisis at the end of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Lumas Etima was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Selected as a Padawan by Jedi Master Ekim Ryelli, Etima constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber and continued to train with his master. Stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple around the time of the vote on the Military Creation Act in the Galactic Senate, Padawan Etima was one of two hundred Jedi to respond to Master Mace Windu's call to arms and joined the strike team dispatched to Geonosis to rescue fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padm√© Amidala from execution by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nLanding on the planet, Etima and his peers stormed the Petranaki arena where they engaged in battle with the battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army. Despite his courage and ability with a lightsaber, Padawan Etima was overpowered by the sheer number of droids and died alongside countless numbers of his colleagues.\nIn Episode II, Lumas Etima was portrayed by stuntman Dean Gould. There is a discrepancy between how he appears in the film and in the Hasbro box pack and Daily Calendar. In Attack of the Clones he can be seen going flying over a shattered piece of pillar and later on deflecting shots back at C-3PO, all the while wearing a dark tunic. The photo from Hasbro and the Calendar  shows him in light-colored clothing and wielding a lightsaber of a design unlike any of the \"standard\" types shared by the rest of the background Jedi.\nLeland Chee originally speculated that this character's fate was unknown. He was later confirmed to have died at Geonosis by The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.\nAn action figure of Lumas Etima was included in the Jedi Knight Army 3-pack from Hasbro along with an unidentified Twi'lek Jedi and Unidentified Rodian Jedi.",
