 "content": "Kres'keth'errylu, nicknamed Keth, was a male Chiss big-game hunter during the Galactic Civil War. He once teamed up with the Duros archaeologist Levat and the pilot Janese to explore a Rakatan temple on the planet Rhen Var.\nAt some point, Keth played a dice game called Hintaro at an establishment that served as a smuggler's hideaway. The hunter's opponent was an old-model assassin droid. Both players had large stacks of gaming chips in front of them and had set down their weapons on the table they were playing atâ€”a blaster rifle in Keth's case and a vibro-ax lodged into the table's surface on the droid's side. Both the Chiss and the droid were standing up while playing the game, with an astromech droid carrying beverage glasses on its dome-shaped head also present at the table. At one point during the game, the droid playing against Keth rolled a set of five red dice on the table, with the hunter watching the throw intently.",
