 "content": "Cat was a Nefrian male who served as the flight engineer of the MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 Cobalt Treasure during the Atterra campaign. He later took over the duties as flight engineer of the Cobalt Wasp after the bomber's previous flight engineer had returned sick after struggling to adjust to the climate on Refnu. On the second run of Atterra campaign, Cobalt and Crimson Squadron were under attack by the First Order. Cat was killed when the Cobalt Wasp was destroyed by TIE fighters.",
