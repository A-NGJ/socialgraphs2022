 "content": "Lornto Teswam was a female Human from Lothal. Approximately five years before the Battle of Yavin, she and her family became targets of the Galactic Empire. However, Teswam was rescued by the Spectres, and was granted asylum in the Haven, a secret settlement created as a refuge for defenseless citizens.\nBefore being granted renewed hope by the Spectres, Teswam revealed that she was being coerced into following Imperial orders, via threats made against her family by the Empire.",
