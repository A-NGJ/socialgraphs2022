 "content": "Mirax was a male Kajain'sa'Nikto slave who worked at the Shipyards of Gwori during the Clone Wars.\nAround 22 BBY, Mirax worked as a slave on the planet Gwori for the Confederacy of Independent Systems until he held the position of foreman. As Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi lead the Grand Army of the Republic to battle the Separatists and free the slaves, Mirax, along with slaves were free and decided to leave Gwori. They were later employed as laborers for the Republic defense industry.",
