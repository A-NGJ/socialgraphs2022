 "content": "Peawp R'dawc was a female Zabrak and combat expert who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. She was the owner of the R'dawc Bodyguard Agency.\nPeawp R'dawc was an expert of hand-to-hand combat. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, she owned the R'dawc Bodyguard Agency, a bodyguard agency based in Mos Eisley, Tatooine. Her clients included Otwi Opawl, Walter Orvett and Tobo.\nAround the same time, Peawp R'dawc also worked for Mikdanyell Guh'rantt, the mayor of Mos Eisley, and was tasked to take care of the thugs who preyed on the city. In 1 ABY, she managed to get an individual to deal with the problem. While affiliated with Jabba the Hutt's criminal organization, the spacer acted on behalf of the Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt. The spacer rid the outskirts of Mos Eisley of undesirable swoopers, scavengers, moisture thieves, gunrunners, malfunctioning battle droids and escaped criminals. Peawp R'dawc eventually tasked the spacer to defeat Vaigon Shinn's muggers in their hideout.\nPeawp R'dawc was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Peawp R'dawc was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. She used to be a specialized trainer providing quests to the beginner players who had chosen a \"brawler\" career. The \"brawler\" profession was later removed from the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005, and Peawp R'dawc's quests were widely revamped to be available for every new players.\nThe card \"Moisture Thieves\" of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game misspelled her name as \"Peawp R'dwac.\"",
