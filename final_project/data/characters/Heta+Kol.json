 "content": "Heta Kol, a Human female Mandalorian also referred to as Field Marshal Kol, was the leader of a group of disenfranchised Mandalorians known as the Hidden Chain who opposed Mandalore the Avenger during the third Galactic War.\nIn 3626 BBY, Heta Kol launched an attack against the Mandalorian ship the Spirit of Vengeance II, with Clan Varad, the Dar'manda, and the Ash'ad following her into battle. Near the end of the attack, she engaged in battle with the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo, and was defeated. However, upon learning that her followers had secured the banner of Clan Cadera, she pulled out and retreated from the fight.\nFollowing the battle, she met with representatives of the three groups that had joined her, which included Tyrus Brokenblade, Bask Sunn, and Durn Wynnward, as well as a number of members from each group. Upon hearing them arguing with each other, Kol pulled out a thermal detonator and tossed it down towards Brokenblade, who managed to catch it in his hand and prevent it from exploding, so long as he kept his hand on it. Kol claimed that they could only truly accomplish their goals if they were working together. To prove this point, she stabbed Brokenblade twice to show that they all needed to rely on each other. She then dismissed everyone to fulfill the orders given to them.\nSometime after Darth Malgus' capture, Heta Kol met with the Hidden Chain on an unknown location and reunited with Ri'kan Kateen who brought his sister, the rogue Jedi Padawan, Sa'har Kateen to provide Heta with the help that she required for a certain task.\nHeta Kol first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught, as part of \"Game Update 6.2: Echoes of Vengeance\", released in 2020. Following the release of \"Game Update 7.0: Legacy of the Sith\" on February 15, 2022, players noticed that both the armor color scheme and the voice actress of Heta Kol had been changed. This change coincided with Melissa Medina announcing on February 17 that she was the voice actress of Heta Kol.",
