 "content": "CT-1477 was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. When Boba Fett entered the reactor room aboard the Endurance, CT-1477 assumed he was a lost cadet and contacted security to escort him back to his company. While talking, Boba convinced the trooper to let him hold his DC-15A blaster rifle. Boba used the weapon to deliver multiple blows to CT-1477. The first blow struck his helmet, and the second blow brought him to his knees. Fett then struck him directly in the face, knocking his helmet off and sending him to the floor. There, the trooper pleaded to the younger clone not to shoot when he aimed the blaster at him, saying that they were brothers. Boba was softened by this and was distracted long enough for CT-1477 to kick Fett's legs out from under him. As CT-1477 tried to reach the blaster, Fett grabbed the weapon first and stunned him. With CT-1477 lying on the ground unconscious, Boba proceeded to destroy the main reactor.",
