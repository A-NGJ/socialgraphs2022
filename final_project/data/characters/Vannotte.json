 "content": "Vannotte was a female Ithorian who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nVannotte appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, she would have been in Tyrena. However, she is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
