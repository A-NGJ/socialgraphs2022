Mandi was the only member of the Sorority on Saleucami to know that Revah was not really their leader. An ambitious woman, Mandi hoped to see Revah captured by the Zan Consortium so that she could claim the mask for herself. Giving away vital information to a Rodian fence named Krezo Wasanti, Mandi planned to allow Revah's capture. Mandi carried a blaster pistol and vibrosword, while wearing laminate armor for her own protection. She often draped a rust-red cape over her shoulders and had a scar over her right eye.",
