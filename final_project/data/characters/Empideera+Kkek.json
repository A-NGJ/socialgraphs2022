 "content": "Empideera Kkek was a Jawa trader who lived on Tatooine during the height of the New Order. He considered himself an \"exalted master scavenger\", and was one of the few Jawa's to give refunds for damaged or defective merchandise. This tactic angered his fellow clan members, until they discovered that it was an effective way to make money. Empideera's modified power droid, DC-GNK, served as his translator in trading business.",
