 "content": "In the year 33 BBY, a Yuuzhan Vong individual was captured and brought to the prison facility known as Cog Hive Seven. The Yuuzhan Vong's body an amalgamation of different implants, the cyborg quickly became the prison's newest reigning champion in the regular gladiatorial matches that took place at the station. As the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species were still unknown to the galaxy at the time, the prison authorities could not find the warrior's species in their databases. However, some of the guards believed that the prisoner was a female. Armed with an amphistaff, the warrior won every match for six months straight, until the Yuuzhan Vong was matched against new-arrival Sith Lord Darth Maul, who was on an undercover mission aboard Cog Hive Seven as the criminal \"Jagannath.\" After a hard-fought battle, Maul killed the Yuuzhan Vong in a brutal fashion, claiming the mantle of the prison's champion.\nThe Yuuzhan Vong prisoner appeared in Joe Schreiber's 2014 novel Maul: Lockdown.",
