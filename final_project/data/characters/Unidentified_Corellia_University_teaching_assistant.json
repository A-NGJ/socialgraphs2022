 "content": "A teaching assistant at the Corellia University worked for Professor Cornelius Wagglehorn at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY Wagglehorn lost contact with a mobile research outpost on Talus. As he didn't want to involve the authorities, he sought an independent being to investigate the situation at the camp. For this reason he sent his assistant to the hidden village of Aurilia, where the assistant recruited an experienced adventurer to help Wagglehorn with his problem.\nThe Corellia University teaching assistant was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Corellia University teaching assistant was added to the game along with the \"Exar Kun\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 9\" update, on April 3, 2008.\nThe assistant could be found in the Adventurers' Guildhall in Aurilia on Dathomir, which was the hub and starting place for all Heroic Encounters. Talking to him started the prequest that gave the player access to the Exar Kun encounter.",
