 "content": "Talte was a Human male who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. He was an officer of the Corellian Security Force.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Talte held the rank of commander within the Corellian Security Force and was assigned to the city of Doaba Guerfel. In 1 ABY, he recruited a spacer who had previously worked with his colleague, Captain Jark, in Tyrena.\nCommander Talte had a problem with people going missing and sent the spacer to discover the cause of it. The missing people were hikers who disappeared in the Thaos Mountains. The spacer questioned Angela, the wife of one of the missing hikers Ilyamo, to learn more about the trail. The spacer also interrogated Myron Beech who organized the hiking trail. The spacer later met Jareck Arned who was living a solitary life in the mountains and searched his home that was located on the hiking trail. However, another group of people suddenly disappeared. The spacer immediately went to the spot where the second group disappeared where he fought several cave-dwellers, an anti-government and criminal group. From a communicator found on a body, Commander Talte managed to triangulate a signal to a cave. Talte thus ordered the spacer to rescue the hostages before they were executed. Commander Talte's agents finally assaulted the cave and freed the hostages. The cave-dweller leader Raynod Menar was killed by the spacer during the attack.\nCommander Talte appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Commander Talte was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
