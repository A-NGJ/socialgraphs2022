 "content": "Larry was a three-eyed alien male who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor. In his childhood, Larry ran away from his home and became a hermit, living alone inside of a tree. When visitors came to the fort built atop his tree, Larry frightened them off by shrieking into the tree's roots, which reverberated his voice throughout the structure. The Kagles, who had visited the fort and believed Larry's voice to be evil forest spirits, referred to him as \"the Shrieks.\"\nIn 3 ABY, the Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Teebo came to reside in the tree fort and eventually discovered Larry. The hermit told the Ewoks his story, and the pair, having also ran from home, decided that they should return. That night, Larry and the Ewoks went to Bright Tree Village and celebrated the Harvest Festival. Later, when Warrick and Teebo were trading items on behalf of the merchant Mooth, Larry convinced the Ewoks to give him a fire feather blanket for free.\nLarry was an alien who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor. When he was a child, he ran away from his home, saying that it would take \"a million munyips to drag him back.\" He came to live inside a tree near the Ewok settlement of Bright Tree Village. After a few years of independence, Larry grew homesick and returned to his childhood abode, only to discover that everyone there had moved away. By 3 ABY, Larry's tree had a fort built into its branches. Larry was unreceptive to visitors, and he scared off intruders by shrieking into the tree's roots; the roots echoed the sound throughout the fort and created an illusion of multiple displaced voices. One group of visitors, the Kagles, believed Larry's cries to be evil forest spirits and dubbed the mysterious howling \"the Shrieks.\"\nIn 3 ABY, Larry's tree received two uninvited guests: the young Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Teebo. The pair had run away from Bright Tree Village and decided to occupy the old, ramshackle tree fort. When the Ewoks climbed into the fort, Larry spied on them, laughing and telling himself that they would not stay long. Later that day, as Warrick and Teebo made repairs to the fort, Larry peered at them from beneath the floorboards.\nLater, during a rainstorm, Warrick was alone in the fort. Larry watched him from inside the wall and shrieked loudly, startling the Ewok. Teebo reentered the fort with the Kagles and started a game of Trok. The Kagles were surprised that the Shrieks allowed the Ewoks to stay. When Warrick revealed that he had not heard of the Shrieks, the Kagles realized that they were in the fort without permission and fled, terrified. Warrick and Teebo considered returning to their village but instead began setting traps to defeat the Shrieks.\nOnce the Ewoks set up their traps and darkened the room, Larry crept through the space, causing the Ewoks to tumble into their own traps. Larry fled through the fort's front door, shrieking, with the Ewoks in pursuit. Larry then ran back into the tree, and the Ewoks followed his voice inside. As the Ewoks approached, he continued to shriek and laugh, warning them to turn back or be destroyed. Teebo wanted to leave, but Warrick took Teebo's magic pouch and blew dust into the tree roots, causing Larry to sneeze. He then ran out of the tree roots for fresh air, and the Ewoks tackled him.\nWith Larry held down, Warrick told the Shrieks to surrender. Larry confessed that there was nobody else, and that the Shrieks were just him. Warrick did not believe him, so Larry pulled back a curtain and revealed the tree's \"voice roots.\" Teebo asked why Larry had to scare them, to which he simply replied that they had been in his tree. He told the Ewoks his story of running away from home. Upon hearing Larry's tale, the Ewoks decided to return to Bright Tree Village. That night, Larry attended the village's Harvest Festival, happily chattering and gorging himself with various foods.\nLater that year, Larry was collecting sticks outside of his tree and was approached by Warrick and Teebo, who were trading items on behalf of Mooth, a local merchant. When Larry said that it was cold outside, Warrick offered to trade the hermit a fire feather blanket. Larry noted that the blanket was nice but that he had nothing to trade for it.\nHe shivered and wiped away tears as he reiterated that he was poor, lonely, and cold. Larry's desperation made Teebo cry, and the hermit continued his act until Warrick gave him the blanket for free. He then thanked Warrick and bounded inside the tree.\nLarry was an obese, violet-furred alien male with an orange nose and bags under his three yellow-green eyes. Two of Larry's eyes were positioned on his face, while the third rested in a stalk atop his head. He had light skin, which was visible on his arms and feet. Larry had a gray moustache and black eyebrows. He was approximately 0.8 meters tall.\nAs a child, Larry left his home. After returning to his childhood home and discovering that everyone there had moved, he felt as if he had been left behind. During Larry's time as a lonely, reclusive hermit, he talked to himself and scared away visitors by yelling and laughing. At the Harvest Festival, Larry consumed generous amounts of food and drink, talking to his new Ewok acquaintances. On a later occasion, Larry used his reputation as a lone hermit to receive a fire feather blanket from Warrick.\nWhile under his \"Shrieks\" persona, Larry utilized the roots of his tree to scare away trespassers. By yelling into the roots, his voice was carried throughout the entire tree and sounded like an army of spirits. Inside the tree, Larry had a torch, curtains covering a tunnel to the roots, and a pot filled with food. When Larry received a fire feather blanket from Warrick, he took the gift into his tree.\nLarry first appeared in \"Home is Where the Shrieks Are,\" the third episode in the second season of the animated television series Ewoks. The episode was written by Bob Carrau, and it premiered on September 20, 1986. The final model sheet for Larry, labeled \"E-35\" and dated to May 6, 1986, was approved by Ewoks production designer Kirk Henderson.",
