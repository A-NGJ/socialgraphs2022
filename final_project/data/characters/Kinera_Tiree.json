 "content": "Kinera Tiree was the daughter of the Imperial education minister Fondana Tiree on Lothal. She was a student at Phelarion School, an upper-crust school in Lothal's Capital City. During the Transportation Ministry data breach, Merei Spanjaf impersonated Kinera Tiree in order to infiltrate the Transportation Ministry's headquarters and plant snoopers there. After the Imperial authorities detected the data breach, the Imperial data-security investigator Jessa Spanjaf  questioned Kinera but quickly determined that she was not the infiltrator upon learning she was sitting for an exam on the same day that the data breach occurred.",
