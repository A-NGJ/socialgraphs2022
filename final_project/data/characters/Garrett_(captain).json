 "content": "Garrett was a male Human captain serving the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War.\nDuring the Battle of Corellia in 3640 BBY, Garrett was serving under Sith Lord Haresh, who was in turn answering to Darth Vowrawn. While the battle for Coronet City—the capital of Corellia—raged on and Darth Baras's assassins coming after Vowrawn, the Sith pulled a bold plan by making their base of operations inside a Republic-aligned corporate building. Having secretly infiltrated the building, soldiers like Garrett put on Republic uniforms and made a show in front of the holocameras, so that Republic enemies had no reason so suspect something was awry. The Emperor's Wrath however laughed at Garrett for using an Imperial accent even though he was in cover and killed him out of impatience.\nThe Emperor's Wrath could choose to tell him to give up the annoying act, kill him or play along with Garrett. If you play along with Garrett's act, he will be spared.",
