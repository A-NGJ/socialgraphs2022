 "content": "Shonaan Broquel was a male Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He had a shop in the Anchorhead market, where he sold light armor.\nBroquel appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Light Armor Vendor for Republic players on Tatooine. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Broquel was removed from the game along with the rest of the Light Armor Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games, which labeled him as \"Shonaan Broquel.\"",
