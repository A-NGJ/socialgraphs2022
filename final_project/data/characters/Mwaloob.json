 "content": "Mwaloob was a male Aqualish medic who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nMwaloob was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Mwaloob spawned under the generic \"lost_aqualish_scout\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as male Aqualish or as a female Aqualish. Because the quest dialogue identified Mwaloob as male, this article assumes that the male Aqualish depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
