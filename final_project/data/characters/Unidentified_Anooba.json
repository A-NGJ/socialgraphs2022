 "content": "This Anooba resided on the planet of Lola Sayu during the Battle of Lola Sayu.\nThis Anooba was part of a pack held at the Citadel prison and used in case of prison breakouts for tracking down and eliminating fugitives. Around 21 BBY, this Anooba and the rest of the pack was let loose by warden Osi Sobeck to track down the squadron of clone troopers and Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker who came to the prison to rescue Jedi Master Even Piell who was held there for interrogation regarding the Nexus Route. In the firefight that ensued on the planet, the pack of Anoobas were killed by the Jedi, with the exception of this one which managed to sneak past the attackers and took advantage of the general chaos created to attack and kill master Even Piell. Noticing the attack, Padawan Ahsoka Tano came to protect Piell and used the Force to push this Anooba past a nearby cliff and into the lava below.",
