 "content": "Lergo Brazee was a Human male that lived during the Galactic Civil War. Around 1 ABY, he could be found on the planet Naboo in the Keren cantina where he gave out mercenary work to spacers. He hired one spacer to bring a new set of piloting permits to one of his friends and then asked him to escort a different friend named Slym Shu'dee who was being chased by a bounty hunter. Once he had seen he could trust the spacer he paid him to rescue an induvidual captured by several Gungans and finally asked him to assassinate another Gungan, Big Blismo.",
