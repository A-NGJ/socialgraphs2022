 "content": "A Trandoshan took part in a hunt, along with several other Trandoshans, in a village of Wookiees on the planet Kashyyyk sometime between 44 BBY and 32 BBY. The Trandoshans decided to attack the village during Life Day, an important Wookiee festivity, to take advantage of the Wookiee's weakness during the holiday.\nDuring the hunt, the Trandoshan hunter attacked Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was on Kashyyyk along with his Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, to celebrate Life Day. The hunter kicked Kenobi, making his lightsaber fall to the ground. The Trandoshan claimed that the Jedi would have made a nice addition to their hunt, but before he could capture Kenobi, Jinn Force pushed the hunter against a tree. The Trandoshan had brown skin and orange eyes. He wielded an ax and wore a pink, blue, and purple armor.\nThe Trandoshan hunter appeared in the comic story \"Life Day,\" published in the third issue of the Star Wars Adventures comic book on February 3, 2021. The comic story was written by Michael Moreci and illustrated by Megan Levens and Charlie Kirchoff and was the first of a two-part story that continued with \"Life Day Part 2\" in the fourth issue on March 24, 2021.",
