 "content": "Taryish Juhden was a human male who spent time in Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. While at the outpost he encountered the scavenger Rey several times, and watched her fend off two thugs working for Unkar Plutt as they tried to steal the astromech droid BB-8. He later fled when Niima was attacked by the forces of the First Order, running past stormtroopers firing on civilians.\nTaryish Juhden who was present in Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. He was present in Niima Outpost when the scavenger Rey arrived alone on her speeder shortly after the First Order's attack on the nearby Tuanul village, and walked past her and the scavenger Roodown as Rey dismounted.\nHe was then present again the next day and was amongst a group whom the First Order deserter Finn approached in search of water. Another of the group shooed Finn away, forcing him to drink from a happabore trough. Both Juhden and Finn were later amongst a group who gathered to watch Rey fight off two thugs working for the junk dealer Unkar Plutt, who ran Niima. Rey's attackers attempted to steal the astromech droid BB-8 from the scavenger, but she managed to successfully fight them both off with her quarterstaff. Shortly after the confrontation the First Order attacked Niima in search of the BB-8. During the fighting Juhden sprinted behind a trio of stormtroopers who were firing at Rey and the First Order deserter Finn, as well as various bystanders.\nJuhden was a fair-skinned human male.\nWhile in Niima, Juhden wore a light brown robe, a pair of green-lensed goggles and a large headwrap.\nTaryish Juhden was played by an uncredited extra in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The character was not named in the film, but was identified in the video game Disney Infinity 3.0, which was released in conjunction with the film. Despite the game being non-canon, story group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed on Twitter that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including Juhden, were considered canon. In the game he takes part in the mission \"Bolt of Inspiration\", where he offers to pay the player in scrap if they can round up several MSE-series mouse droids that are loose in Niima and bring them to him so he can put restraining bolts on them.",
