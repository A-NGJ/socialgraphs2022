 "content": "Che'ri was a Chiss female who served as an ozyly-esehembo within the Chiss Ascendancy. Thalias was her caregiver, or \"Momish\" while she served on Mitth'raw'nuruodo's ship. She liked to draw on her Questis and later with colored graph markers. She often drew pictures of birds, flashflies, and scenery as seen from above, as she had always dreamed of flying. Che'ri often had nightmares, which was typical of Sky-walkers.\nChe'ri was born around 29 BBY. At a young age, she was determined to have Third Sight, and was made part of the Chiss Sky-walker corps.\nShe served on multiple ships, with multiple caregivers, until she fell under service to Mitth'raw'nuruodo aboard his ship, the Springhawk. Her caregiver aboard the Springhawk was Mitth'ali'astov, known by the core name Thalias. While under service of Thrawn, she guided the ship through many systems within the Chaos, including one quaternary star system that nearly gave Che'ri sensory overload.\nShe later served as a pilot on Thrawn's ship during his missions to Batuu and Mokivj. During an assault on a Separatist droid factory she launched decoys in order to land within the factory and help Thrawn retrieve the shield generator that had been protecting the factory.\nShe also aided Thrawn by pretending to be a Chiss family hostage alongside her Momish, Thalias. They were able to deceive Yiv, leading to his capture.\nChe'ri played a pivotal role in preventing a scheme to cause a civil war among the Chiss from coming to fruition. At the Hoxim incident, Che'ri used her powers of Third Sight to guide the hands of weapons officer Afpriuh to aim the Springhawk's weapons. Che'ri and Afpriuh aimed at the commandeered Watith freighter Saltbarrel at the exact angle needed to destroy the fake Agbui nyix mine and make it look accidental. As a result, the Great Families could not fight over the fake nyix deposit, believing it destroyed.",
