 "content": "Yotts Orren was a Kadas'sa'Nikto guard who often worked onboard Jabba's sail barge, Khetanna. During the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, he rode on the second Bantha-II cargo skiff.\nOrren was a smuggler. He sometimes stole weapons from Jabba's Palace. Few trusted him. He was known to wear a gray jumpsuit and green helmet.\nIn 4 ABY Orren was aboard the second Bantha-II cargo skiff piloted by Pote Snitkin during the battle that broke out when Jabba tried to execute his prisoners, the Heroes of Yavin, over the Great Pit of Carkoon. Orren was among the many killed by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker's lightsaber during the battle.\nYotts Orren appears as a Kadas'sa'Nikto aboard the second Bantha-II cargo skiff during the skirmish at Carkoon in 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. He was portrayed by an uncredited extra. In 1998's Star Wars: Behind the Magic CD-ROM, Orren's image is used when the player is asked to identify a Kadas'sa'Nikto. In 2001, Orren was given a name and brief backstory on a card for the Tatooine Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Decipher, however, erroneously used the image of another Nikto named Klaatu.\nOriginally, Leland Chee had identified the Kenner \"Klaatu in skiff guard outfit\" action figure as Yotts Orren, on his now defunct Keeper of the Holocron's Blog. This character, dressed in white coveralls, only appeared on the top deck of the Khetanna during Return of the Jedi.\nOn July 6, 2011, Leland Chee retconned Orren's identity to be the previously unnamed green-hooded Nikto guard aboard the second skiff, on his revived Keeper of the Holocron blog on Facebook.\nUltimately, this means that Klaatu is now the \"Klaatu in skiff guard outfit\" aboard the Khetanna, and, therefore, the popular conjecture that \"Klaatu, Barada, Nikto\" are together on the second skiff has been debunked.",
