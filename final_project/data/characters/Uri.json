 "content": "Uri was a male Gotal who worked as a bouncer at Merl's, a cantina in the Old Town of the spaceport Muracie on Centares during the Imperial Period. Uri, along with his partner Glocken, served as enforcers for the under-the-table dealings of the cantina's owner, Merl, who specialized in hiding desperate people willing to pay. A specialist with his heavy blaster pistol, Uri was known to be quick to draw his weapon if anyone threatened Merl. In 0 ABY, notorious cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance arrived in Merl's while searching for Tyler Lucian, a Rebel deserter Merl had helped conceal on Centares. When Valance threatened Merl for information, both Uri and Glocken jumped to his defense, only to be immediately shot down by the quick-trigged hunter.\nUri first appeared in Star Wars  29, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979, where he was illustrated by Carmine Infantino. Although Uri's species was originally unidentified, he was revealed as a Gotal in the 2003 Star Wars Roleplaying Game adventure seed Triplet Threat.",
