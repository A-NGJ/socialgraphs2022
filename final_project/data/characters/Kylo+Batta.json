 "content": "Kylo Batta was a Human male famed for his career as a big-game hunter. While residing on the planet Chandrila, Batta and a noblewoman had a son named Kaori, who grew up during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Kaori desired to match Kylo's reputation, so he avoided recruitment by the Imperial Military and eventually became a renowned beast hunter like his father.\nKylo Batta was first mentioned in Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy by Paul Danner, a 1997 sourcebook for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.",
