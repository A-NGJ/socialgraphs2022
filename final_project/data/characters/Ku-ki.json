She recorded at least one hologram about the fate of the Outcasts following their exodus to the Promised Land, which was discovered by a Republic-allied individual on Taris. She was eventually succeeded by Lurr.\nKu-ki was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011.",
