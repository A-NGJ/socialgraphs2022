 "content": "Trigg was a Jabiimi Loyalist during the Galactic Civil War.\nTrigg distrusted Luke Skywalker, the son of Anakin Skywalker who betrayed his people. In a firefight with Jabiimi Nationalists, he found himself fighting alongside Luke and Nolan Gillmunn, the leader of the Jabiimi Loyalists. Trigg blamed the attack on Luke, but led the Jedi to a service lift and escape from the enemy. However, Trigg realized that the lift would not carry them away from the oncoming stormtroopers and decided to continue the fight to allow his commander to escape. Luke wished Trigg good luck before the lift carried them away, but Trigg's final words were, \"I'm not doing this for you.\" Trigg died fighting stormtroopers, buying Luke and Nolan the necessary time to escape.",
