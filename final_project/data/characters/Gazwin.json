 "content": "Gazwin was an Uthuthma male who spent time on the planet Jakku following the Battle of Endor. He was seated on a stall at Ergel's Bar in Cratertown when the human settler Corwin Ballast took a seat next to him. Gazwin attempted to converse with the new arrival in his own language, but Ballast could not understand and simply winked and gave the alien a thumbs up. The Uthuthma then stared at Ballast until the bartender Ergel caught the human's attention and begun discussing what he wanted to drink, as well as the local area and Ballast's past. As the pair spoke, Gazwin periodically tried to comment but was told by Ergil not to interrupt. As an Uthuthma, Gazwin had a skull-like face with eyes in sockets and a toothy maw. He wore swaddles of chain around his neck like a scarf which obscured his mouth from view.\nGazwin first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
