VenHalgon had the Kiss land on Cularin and went off hunting with her husband. After the men failed to return, Mrs. Cannison went off to search for them, along with Lady VenHalgon and Mrs. Cannison. They themselves were eventually rescued by the native Tarasin, who helped to reunite them with their husbands.",
