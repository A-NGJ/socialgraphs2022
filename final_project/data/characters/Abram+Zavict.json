 "content": "Abram Zavict was a Human male independent trader who was friends with the Balinaka sculptor Vornest Dep-thesel Digarsarg. When Digarsarg created his sculpture, \"Crystal of the Stars,\" and became aware of its beautiful, hypnotic light, Zavict chanced across the scene and was similarly enraptured. Zavict decided to sell them to the wider galaxy, founding Galactic Crystal Creations, a company that would sell the resulting Garnib crystals on other worlds.",
