 "content": "Koobaree was a Human female member of the Five, a reclusive evil-worshipping cult that lived within a remote section of space known as the Hellhoop. Koobaree and her compatriots spent centuries torturing and killing unfortunate travelersâ€”notably, they captured and imprisoned Wutzek, the last known living Force demon. Sometime between 0 and 3 ABY, the Five captured Rebel leaders Han Solo and Leia Organa, planning to kill the two Humans the same way they had so many others. However, their Wookiee friend Chewbacca managed to free Wutzek, who killed Koobaree and all other members of the Five.\nKoobaree appeared in The Pandora Effect, a 1981 comic story written by Alan Moore and published in The Empire Strikes Back Monthly 151. In the story, Koobaree was drawn by Adolfo Buylla.",
