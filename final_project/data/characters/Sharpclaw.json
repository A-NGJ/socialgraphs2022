 "content": "Sharpclaw was the name of a vine cat residing on Dromund Kaas around 3643 BBY, when it was killed by an Empire-affiliated individual.\nSharpclaw appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Dromund Kaas. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed by any Imperial character for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
