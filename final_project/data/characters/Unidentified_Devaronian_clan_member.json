 "content": "A Devaronian male was a member of a clan of Devaronians during the Imperial Era, who had a bounty placed on them. Around 3 ABY, he and his clan engaged in a shootout with the cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance within Black Spire Outpost on Batuu. Though his clanmates were killed, the Devaronian attempted to ram Valance with a landspeeder, but was ultimately knocked out and captured by the cyborg.\nDuring the Imperial Era, the Devaronian operated with a clan of Devaronians. Around 3 ABY, after the clan had a bounty place on their heads, they resided at Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet Batuu, awaiting the arrival of the cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance. When Valance finally arrived at the outpost, the clan ambushed the cyborg.\nAs the shootout progressed, the Devaronian was left as the sole surviving clanmate, and attempted to flee through a crowd as a result. He hijacked a landspeeder by throwing its driver off. He drove away before turning around in an attempt to ram Valance, threatening him as he closed in on the cyborg. However, the Devaronian was forced out of the speeder when Valance ripped off a pipe from a moisture vaporator and slammed him with it, knocking him out cold and allowing the bounty hunter to capture the Devaronian.\nThe Devaronian was a male with black eyes and red skin. He was initially shocked to see his clanmates fall while fleeing, but while closing in on Valance with a speeder, however, the Devaronian claimed he had killed several bounty hunters in a show of overconfidence before he was knocked out by the cyborg.\nThe Devaronian wore a white long-sleeved shirt under a brown vest, along with brown pants and a holster around his waist. While fighting off Valance, he utilized a blaster pistol.\nThe Devaronian first appeared in the first issue of Star Wars: Bounty Hunters, a comic book series written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Paolo Villanelli, and published by Marvel Comics on March 11, 2020.",
