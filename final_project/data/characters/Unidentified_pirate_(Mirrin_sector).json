 "content": "A pirate was a member of a pirate gang that fought a battle in the Mirrin sector against the New Republic's Rapier Squadron. When Rapier Leader, Poe Dameron was captured he was sent to the pirate for interrogation. The pirate asked Dameron how he and his squadron learned their location but Dameron stalled and told a story about his childhood. Eventually the pirate grew angry and ordered Dameron to be ejected into space and for his X-wing starfighter to be scrapped. But Rapier squadron came to Dameron's rescue. Dameron then freed himself and took the pirates captive.",
