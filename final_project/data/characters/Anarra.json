 "content": "Anarra was a Wookiee who sought to spread the ideals of Life Day. She was one of four Wookiees within her family.\nDuring the Life Day festivities of 1 ABY, Anarra resided on Endor and on Yavin 4 with her family. Her family included Oraalarri, Radrrl and Tebeurra.\nOraalarri would have spacers speak to Anarra and other members of her family to learn more about Life Day. Though naturally sympathetic to the Rebellion, due to the Empire's enslavement of her species, she, like the rest of her family, welcomed Imperials to their home. They told these Imperials that while they themselves may not be bad people, corruption and darkness would consume them as they grow more powerful within the Empire.\nAnarra was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. During the Life Day event of 2004, players could talk to Anarra on either Endor or Yavin 4 to learn about Life Day.",
