 "content": "\"Static\", known by their title \"Omega Ace,\" was the nickname of a human First Order ace pilot from Omega Squadron, a squadron of TIE/fo space superiority fighters. They were a part of the military of the First Order. At one point, Omega Ace proceeded to enter a skirmish with a holdout, with their blaster fire hitting an encampment.\nStatic is a character introduced in the X-Wing Miniatures series. Static's gender is debatable: Although the article I am Their Father Part 2 identifies Static as male, the Advanced Terror article covering the TIE/fo Fighter Expansion Pack for the second edition referred to Static as female.",
