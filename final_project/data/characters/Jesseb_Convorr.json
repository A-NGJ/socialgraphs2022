 "content": "Jesseb Convorr was a Human male who lived on Corellia at the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was high-ranking employee of the Coronet Starport.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Jesseb Convorr served as the starport master of the Coronet Starport, in Coronet City. In 1 ABY, Convorr worked with a spacer to find a missing shipment ordered by the businessman Ral Mundi. The spacer finally discover that it was in fact stolen by the Ragtags. A short time later, Jesseb Convorr requested the assistance of the Corellian Security Force because of the destruction of several terminals in the Starport. CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper sent him a spacer to investigate the vandalism. While Convorr immediately suspected the Meatlumps, the spacer discovered that the Ragtags were responsible, and trying to blame the Meatlumps for the vandalism.\nJesseb Convorr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nJesseb Convorr was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 21\", on August 4, 2005. He was part of the quest named \"Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components\", best known as \"Ral Mundi's quest\".
