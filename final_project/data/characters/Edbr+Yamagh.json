 "content": "Edbr Yamagh was a male Human that lived on Corellia at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Edbr Yamagh worked as an aide to retired CorSec officer Lt. Col. Wilfred Quelsh in Tyrena.\nIn 1 ABY, Quelsh's Corellian Medal of Honor was stolen and Yamagh helped with the search. When Quelsh asked an independent agent to help in the investigation of the theft, Yamagh pointed the spacer to a group of local thugs known as Braggan's Fist. The agent managed to successfully solve the case of the stolen medal and found proof that Quelsh had framed former CorSec officer Kal Braggan for a crime that Quelsh had committed and that he had later murdered Braggan. Yamagh was left speechless by Quelsh's crimes, as he had always considered it an honor to work for a highly decorated officer like Quelsh.\nEdbr Yamagh was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Edbr Yamagh was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006. He could be found in the city of Tyrena on Corellia. Yamagh was part of the quest \"CorSec Case Files: Stolen Honor\" which was part of the Legacy quest line, the longest quest line in the game.",
