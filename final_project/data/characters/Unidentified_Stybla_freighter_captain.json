 "content": "A male Chiss was the captain of a cargo ship owned by the Stybla family. His ship was hijacked by a crew that included members from the Clarr family and set adrift in Glastis 3. Twenty-seven hours later they were discovered by Jandalin and the captain was then questioned by Senior Aide Stybla'ppin'cykok, Syndic Mitth'ras'safis and Mid Commander Mitth'raw'nuru, who were tracking a valuble piece of cargo that had been transported on the cargo ship. The captain and his crew had not been harmed by the hijackers and Jandalin then arranged the cargo ship to be towed to a blackdock while they followed the attackers.",
