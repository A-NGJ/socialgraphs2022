 "content": "Tooqui was a male Gwurran  who attempted to steal Jedi Barriss Offee's provisional food while she and her companions were on a mission to prevent the planet Ansion's secession from the Galactic Republic in 22 BBY, before the Clone Wars.\nEager to learn of life outside of his modest home in the hills with the Gwurran, Tooqui, with the help of Offee , convinced Jedi Master Luminara Unduli to allow him to accompany the Jedi on their journey, so that he might afterward educate his fellow Gwurran on all that he had learned about the wider world in his travels with them.\nThe self-professed brave  Tooqui, because his aims were recognized, in part, as being noble, was therefore permitted to join the \"outlander\" group of Jedi Unduli, Offee, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and their Alwari guides Kyakhta and Bulgan, on their quest to find the Alwari overclan, the Borokii, in the Ansion plains.\nTooqui later managed to free his companions after they had been captured by the non-traditional trading clan, the Qulun, by inciting a herd of lorqual to stampede and wreak havoc on a camp where his comrades were being held captive.\nTooqui was  looked down upon because of his size by the Alwari.",
