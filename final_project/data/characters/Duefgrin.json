 "content": "Duefgrin was a male teenage Brolf living on Barlok who was part of the assassination plot against several negotiators in a Corporate Alliance and Brolfi government mining dispute. Some of the negotiaters included Passel Argente, Guildmaster Gilfrome and Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth.\nDuefgrin stole a pair of burst thrusters to be used in the building of a homemade missile to be targeted, under the leadership of Filvian , against the Barlok negotiators. He passed the thrusters to fellow Brolf conspirator Jhompfi, who, in turn, passed them off to Migress.\nOther items the young Brolfi conspirators collected for the missile construct were explosives, a stabilization system, and alloy packing cylinders.\nDuefgrin wore a red vest with many pockets, in which he carried most of his possessions, and was a mechanical enthusiast who habitually stole what he needed for his projects.",
