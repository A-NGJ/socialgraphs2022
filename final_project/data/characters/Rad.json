 "content": "Rad was a Cerean living on Endor in 15 ABY. He made fun of Ben Solo and the Millennium Falcon. After Ben showed his new friends the Falcon, Rad got to work on the buttons and flew into the orbit of Endor, where remnants of the 2nd Deathstar were flying around. After much deliberation, Ben Solo took over the ship and landed it safely at the resort on Endor.\nRad was first seen in LEGO Star Wars Summer Vacation.",
