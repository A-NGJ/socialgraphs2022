 "content": "Toth'lazhen was a Twi'lek male criminal on Nal Hutta during the Cold War. Toth'lazhen was a lieutenant to the Hutt crime lord Suudaa Nem'ro, lord of Jiguuna, and was considered the rising star in Nem'ro's circle after his Human rival, Karrels Javis, was blamed for several mishaps. Toth'lazhen urged Nem'ro to remain neutral in the standoff between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA battle-trained agent of Imperial Intelligence, sent to coerce Nem'ro to back the Empire, infiltrated Nem'ro's inner circle under the guise of the \"Red Blade\", a notorious pirate, and briefly aided Javis' return to prominence before being forced to eliminate him, planting evidence that Nem'ro's rival Voontara Fa'athra had been responsible. The Agent then went to Toth'lazhen and offered to work against the Fa'athra clan by finding \"proof\"  of Fa'athra's allegiance to the Republic. Thus convinced, Toth'lazhen advised Nem'ro to cease dealings with the Republic, and offer his services solely to the Sith Empire.",
