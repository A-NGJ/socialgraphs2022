 "content": "Zenoc was a female human who served with the Galactic Empire at the rank of colonel. She served as the commanding officer of space station Lansend Twenty-Six, a staging area for slaves for construction of the Death Star. She would however, be attacked by rebel insurgents who had come to free the Wookiees. It wasn't until Commodore Thrawn arrived with his Star Destroyer Chimaera, he was able to decimate their forces.\nZenoc served within the military of the Galactic Empire at the rank of colonel.\nEventually within her military career, Zenoc would become the commander of space station Lansend Twenty-Six, a staging area for slaves.\nZenoc, still commanding Lansend Twenty-Six, would one day be attacked by rebel insurgents. The attackers boarded the space station and attempted to flank the Imperial defenders in a pincer maneuver. The battle seemed to be a victory for the rebels, but thanks to the arrival of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Chimaera underneath the command of Chiss Commodore Thrawn. Thrawn's arrival within the battle saved the station, and ended the uprising of Wookiee slaves.\nZenoc first appeared in the 2017 novel Thrawn, by Timothy Zahn.",
