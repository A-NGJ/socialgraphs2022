 "content": "A female Twi'lek member of the Pilgrims religion was the wife of a fellow Pilgrim named Saylew, and the two lived in Kalikori village on their adopted homeworld of Tython during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the conflict with the native Flesh Raiders in 3643 BBY, Saylew's wife was killed by a Flesh Raider attack on the village. Her death greatly affected Saylew, who had held her body as she died, and his grief caused him to confront the village leaders about their failure to protect the village and his desire for revenge.\nSaylew's wife was first mentioned in the Jedi Knight class mission \"High-Tech Savages\" in the 2011 BioWareâ€“LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, in which the player interrupts Saylew's raging against the Flesh Raiders for the death of his wife.",
