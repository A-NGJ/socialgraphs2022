 "content": "Koa Delko was a Quermian male who served as the Minister of Defense for the Galactic Republic during the Mandalorian Wars. He was present at the trials of Demagol and Dorjander Kace as the prosecutor.\nIn 3963 BBY, Koa Delko represented the government and participated in the trial of Demagol, a member of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, who committed crimes against the Republic. Bearing in mind that the trial would be considered a show trial for symbolic condemnation for all Mandalorians, the prisoner accused Delko for the publicity of his crimes and heated up the many onlookers. Delko refused to listen to those protestations from him.",
