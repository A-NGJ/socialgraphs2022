 "content": "Mallikhan was a male Human pirate who was the brother of Vallkos. At some point during galactic history, Mallikhan and Vallkos traveled to the planet Volik in the Unknown Regions, as part of a large band of pirates. However, following a dispute over a female, the pirate gang split into two rival factions: the Crimson Stars and the Ebon Strikers. Vallkos became the leader of the Crimson Stars, while Mallikhan assumed control of the Ebon Strikers, and the two groups feuded with each another. Mallikhan secretly began negotiations with the Vagaari, a major Unknown Regions power, but unknown to the pirate, the Vagaari planned to betray him.",
