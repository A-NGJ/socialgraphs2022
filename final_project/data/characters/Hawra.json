 "content": "Hawra was an Imperial captain serving as the commander of security at the Lotide Technical Branch Outpost.\nAn outwardly cheery and outgoing man, Hawra was said to be one of the Galactic Empire's most ruthless and ambitious officers. Paranoid and corrupt, his main priority was to gain power and ensure his own safety. While climbing through the ranks, he would use anyone who got in his way, stepping over them when the time came for promotions. Hawra suspected that Lieutenant Pora was targeting him, and was arranging an \"accident\" for Pora in a weapons lab.\nWhen a group of Alliance to Restore the Republic agents infiltrated the tech post posing as scientists from Dakot Seven, Hawra questioned each in turn, asking leading questions in order to find out if they were Alliance spies.",
