 "content": "Meirana was a Tarasin female, the sister of Dariana and Liriana.\nSlightly older and more capable than Dariana, she served as Irstat-Kes of the Hiironi irstat for years. When the Mother of the Hiironi was killed by a kilassin, Meirana was ready to move on to that position, but she was struck down by a strange disease within a day. The other adepts of the irstat said she had been called to be one with the world. Following the succession line, a reluctant Dariana succeeded Meirana as Mother\nThis character name is alternatively spelled Meirana or Meiriana even in the same paragraph.",
