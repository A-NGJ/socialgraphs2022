 "content": "Henzen was a male Twi'lek doctor living in New Adasta on Ziost during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3636 BBY, the former Sith Emperor Vitiate came to the world and possessed many of the Imperials on the planet, turning them into his puppets to murder civilians. Henzen remained unaffected by the madness and tried to find civilians who were trapped in their homes in order to help them evacuate.\nDoctor Henzen was added to Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan in game update 3.2.",
