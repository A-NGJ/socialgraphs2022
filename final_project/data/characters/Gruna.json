 "content": "Gruna was the male Nessie captain of an Ithullan ore hauler, which carried valuable mutonium ore through the Stenness Node in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. Gruna's ship often came under attack by pirates, such as Finhead Stonebone and his gang, due to the hauler's expensive cargo. To counter this, Gruna paid local crime lord Bogga the Hutt to provide security while the ore hauler made its runs through the pirates' territory. On one particular shipment in 3999 BBY, Stonebone's group ambushed Gruna's ship, killing Bogga's enforcer, Dreebo, and siphoning some of the ore. However, Bogga's warship, Enforcer One, dropped out of hyperspace and captured the pirates, saving Gruna, his crew, and his cargo.\nIn the years leading up to the Great Sith War, Gruna, a male Nessie, worked as the captain of an Ithullan ore hauler starship. Gruna's ore hauler, which was made from the carapace of a Colossus wasp, transported valuable mutonium ore from mining colonies in the Stenness Node to the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal. However, these endeavors carried with them great risk, as local pirates often targeted the ore haulers while they traveled through the Node. To protect his cargo from the marauders, Gruna paid a fortune to local crime lord Bogga the Hutt in exchange for armed escorts.\nIn 3999 BBY, Gruna was making a routine shipment of mutonium to the Stenness Hyperspace Terminal when his ore hauler came under attack by Finhead Stonebone's gang of pirates. One of Bogga's men, Dreebo, quickly swooped in piloting his starfighter to protect Gruna's vessel, but he was killed by pirate gunner C'borp in the pirate ship Marauder Starjacker. Gruna and his ship were rendered defenseless, and the pirates breached the ore hauler's hull to begin siphoning the ore. However, Bogga's warship, Enforcer One, appeared out of hyperspace, capturing the pirates and saving Gruna and his crew.\nGruna despised the pirates who plagued the Stenness Node, referring to them as \"scum.\" He quickly grew exasperated and irritated when the pirates attacked his ship, as he expected Bogga's enforcers to come to his rescue faster.\nGruna appears in Tales of the Jedi: The Saga of Nomi Sunrider, the second story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, which was written by Tom Veitch and released over the course of late 1993 and early 1994. He makes his sole appearance in the series in the arc's second issue, which was illustrated by David Roach. In 1998, Gruna was given an entry in the Star Wars Encyclopedia, and in 2008, he received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
