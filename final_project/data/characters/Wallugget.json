 "content": "Wallugget was a particularly large and dangerous Walluga skullsmasher that lived in a group of wallugas on the Common Paths of the Rryatt Trail on Kashyyyk.\nWallugget was a creature in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. It could be found on the Common Paths level of the Rryatt Trail. It was a level 54 Gold Chevron elite, which meant that it was much stronger and tougher than normal wallugas and even posed a threat to players with higher levels. It was not involved in any quest, though players have to cross the small area with Wallugget and a group of other wallugas to reach the next level of the Rryatt trail.",
