 "content": "Cahel Tse was a male Human Jedi Padawan serving the fledgling Jedi Order during its first days on the planet Tython. He was an apprentice of Master Rajivari and became one of his devout followers. Along with a number of other apprentices trained by Rajivari, he abandoned the Order when Rajivari renounced his oath to the Order he helped found circa 25,783 BBY. Taking up residence in the fortress city of Kaleth, Cahel and the followers of Rajivari were encountered by an army of Flesh Raiders.",
