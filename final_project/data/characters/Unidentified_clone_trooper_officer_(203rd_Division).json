 "content": "An officer served as a clone stormtrooper within the Galactic Empire's 203rd Division. Shortly following the Cleansing of New Plympto, the officer and the 203rd were stationed at a spaceport and blocking any civilian ships from leaving. When the Jedi Dass Jennir managed to sneak into the spaceport impersonating a lieutenant from the 501st Legion and steal an Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter in order to create a ploy for the civilians to escape, the clone officer ordered his comrades to stop the ships by getting airborne. The officer was equipped with Phase II clone trooper armor in his unit's markings, a pauldron, and a DC-17 hand blaster.",
