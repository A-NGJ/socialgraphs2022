 "content": "Dellso Prin was a Cingulon male who worked as a used starship seller and mechanic. He was loosely affiliated with the Resistance during its war against the First Order, and after the Resistance established a base on the moon Ajan Kloss, Prin hauled cargo and supplies to it. Prin was drawn to working with the Resistance by the promise of being able to work on legendary ships such as the Tantive IV and Millennium Falcon.\nIn 35 ABY, Prin was present in the base when Jedi-in-training Rey returned from running a training course in the nearby jungle. As Rey spoke to General Leia Organa, Prin stood by an entry ramp into the Tantive IV, holding a datapad and speaking with another Resistance member. Prin had white, pebbly skin and black eyes and wore a green flight suit with a yellow jacket that had two white plates on the front. His outfit also included brown harnesses and a white helmet.\nDellso Prin first appeared in the 2019 Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary by Pablo Hidalgo. Prin was played by actor Nick Kellington, who also played the characters Klaud and Amuncie Tidian in the film.",
