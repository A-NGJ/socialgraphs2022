 "content": "Spane Covis was a male Human who served with the Alliance Special Forces as a sentinel. He was stationed at Port Tower One on Level 88, in the Corellian Sector of Nar Shaddaa, one of the moons of Nal Hutta.\nOne of his functions included keeping an eye out for Imperial activity that might compromise the Rebellion's efforts in the warehouse district of the lunar ecumenopolis. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Spane noticed two camouflaged freighters landing near the port. He immediately realized that something was amiss and alerted his allies in the Rebel Allianceâ€”in actuality the freighters were Imperial Gamma-class assault shuttles. The shuttles opened fire on the warehouse district, destroying stockpiles of munitions that the Rebels had been storing there.\nIn the printed version of A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale, Spane Covis's Rebel SpecForce call sign was Dewback. However, in the webstrip version, Spane Covis's dialogue is divided between two characters: a Human whose name is not directly stated, and a Mon Calamari who uses the callsign \"Dewback\".",
