 "content": "Voe Atell was a female senator who represented the interests of the Corporate Alliance in the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.\nAtell was present in the Senate chamber when Mina Bonteri made her plea to the other senators that a treaty should be proposed toward the Galactic Senate. Atell objected to the treaty on behalf of the Corporate Alliance and voted to continue the war effort. However the treaty was passed, yet the plans were foiled when Count Dooku and his allies bombed Coruscant.\nLater in the war, she was sent to Mandalore to represent the Confederacy in a peace talk with the Republic, along with Amita Fonti and Separatist Congress Leader Bec Lawise. However, the talks were interrupted by Lux Bonteri, son of Mina Bonteri. He claimed that Dooku was behind the murder of his mother, and was subsequently escorted away by commando droids. Although the negotiations went on, they did not get anything done due to the interruption.\nShe is voiced by Catherine Taber, who also voiced fellow senator Padm√© Amidala in the Clone Wars series.",
