 "content": "Larens was a Human male soldier who served in the Corellian Resistance and joined the army of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. Throughout the war, he became a member of Red Hand Squadron under the leadership of Bria Tharen. He was small and agile, and could thus turn off an enemy position with a paralytic grenade under fire protection. After taking the slave ship Helot's Shackle, he participated at the battle of Toprawa and perished as he and entire squadron formed a rearguard for the theft of the Death Star plans.",
