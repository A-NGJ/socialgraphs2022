Partnered with Lieutenant Telsij Cayr in Aggressor Seven, Kian participated in the Battle of Brentaal IV. During Aggressor Wing's assault on the city of Oradin, Cayr and Kian's BTL Y-wing starfighter was shot down by a pilot from the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing. Although Cayr survived, Kian was killed in the crash.\nKin Kian first appeared in X-Wing Rogue Squadron 23 in 1997. In 2000, Decipher, Inc. released their Death Star II Limited expansion for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, identified an unnamed Human pilot as from the Endor briefing as Kin Kian. Whether or not the character on the CCG card was intended to be this character is unknown.",
