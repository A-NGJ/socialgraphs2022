The overall goal of his class was to train students on how to use a Baobab freighter as part of the Baobab Merchant Fleet. His first lesson included a detailed explanation on the different kinds of stars in the galaxy, so that the future pilots would know what they are flying into. Besides supplying information on astronomy and astrography, he also supplied some history lessons regarding some star routes and holdings of the Galaxy's history.\nHis class was used as the frame narrative of The Essential Atlas.",
