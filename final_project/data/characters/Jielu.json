 "content": "Jielu was a member of the Alliance Military's 4th Squad, which was under the command of Corporal Jobin, during the war against the Galactic Empire. In the year 3 ABY, he was stationed at Echo Station 5-7 in the beginning of the Battle of Hoth. They soon realized that the ion cannon was under attack by Imperial forces. He was given the order to stay and protect Echo Base's South Entrance by Jobin, while Jobin and some others went to the ion cannon.",
