 "content": "Oon-ai was a human male lieutenant who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, he became the adjutant of the Sith Lord Darth Vader at Grand General Cassio Tagge's command. However, Vader killed Oon-ai shortly after destroying a space station controlled by a group of pirates, an act which he defended by accusing the Imperial officer of treason.\nLieutenant Oon-ai was a military officer of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Following the destruction of the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin, Emperor Sheev Palpatine placed Darth Vader under the command of Grand General Cassio Tagge, who ordered the Dark Lord of the Sith to take on Oon-ai as an adjutant. In addition to reporting Vader's activities to Tagge, the officer's assignment gave him full access to Vader's communications history.\nAfter tracking a group of pirates to their base, Vader proceeded with a direct assault on the space station, bringing Oon-ai and a squad of stormtroopers with him. The Imperial strike team succeeded in killing the station's crew, although one of the pirates managed to set the base to self-destruct. Oon-ai followed Vader farther into the station, the general's orders compelling him to remain at Vader's side while the latter retrieved the pirates' computer records.\nFollowing the destruction of the pirate station, Vader killed Oon-ai and brought his corpse to Tagge on the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Annihilator. The Sith Lord claimed that the data he downloaded from the pirates' computer system included evidence of Oon-ai's treason and therefore cautioned the general to vet his next adjutant more carefully. Later, Vader destroyed an astromech droid after it assured him that all evidence of its data upload had been purged.\nOon-ai was a human male who had black hair, brown eyes, and light skin. As an Imperial officer serving under Cassio Tagge's command, he followed the general's orders to letter by monitoring Darth Vader while acting as the Sith's adjutant. In this capacity, he was required to remain at Vader's side, even during hostile situations. Oon-ai also sought access to Vader's communications; the Sith Lord not only objected to this idea, but also dismissed Oon-ai as a meddling clerk. Nevertheless, Oon-ai insisted that it was his duty and threatened to report Vader to Tagge unless he complied with the request.\nOon-ai first appeared in Darth Vader  2, the second issue of the Marvel comic book series Star Wars: Darth Vader, written by Kieron Gillen and released on February 25, 2015.",
