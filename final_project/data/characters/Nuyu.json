 "content": "Nuyu was a male Lafrarian who worked as a tattoo artist and a body decorator in the market of the space station known as StarForge Station, as of 0 ABY. From his shop Nuyu's, the Lafrarian made a decent living selling body alterations, varying from large to small, to pirates and mercenaries. Nuyu used clean equipment and tools.\nNuyu first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit. Nuyu is provided as a sample person who sells goods and services in the market, through which the players pass.",
