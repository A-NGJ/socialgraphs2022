 "content": "A Nalroni female, Weezo ran Weezo's Gun Shop, a personal armament store which was located in the market of the space station StarForge Station. Scarred and forced to wear an eye patch by 0 ABY, Weezo specialized in ship-board weapons, and her prices were double list price, though that was considered normal on StarForge Station. The storeowner allowed customers to try out her goods in a weapons range situated at the back of her shop. After putting the weapons in the range room, Weezo would allow the customer in, and would not let them out until they used up the small amount of ammunition. As her store did not supply armor, she referred customers who were looking for that to Just Armor, another store in the market.\nWeezo first appeared in \"Preparing for War,\" an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game written by Timothy S. O'Brien.",
