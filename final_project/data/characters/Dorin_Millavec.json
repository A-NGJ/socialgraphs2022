 "content": "Dorin Millavec was a commander on the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Crucible during the Galactic Civil War. He first sees Nas Ghent making an unauthorized boarding of the Crucible in a Headhunter-model fighter. Millavec is angry with this intrusion, but keeps his cool by saying that it was quite a stunt to infiltrate the fleet in such a quaint fighter. He orders stormtroopers to open fire on Ghent, only to have Darth Vader appear and order the stormtroopers to hold their fire. Vader pointed a lightsaber at Millavec and said that the pilot was under his protection: \"take his life and I take your own.\" Personally ordered by Darth Vader to oversee and help Nas Ghent in forming the Black Eight Squadron, Millavec, viewing the entire situation as a plot against his promotion prospects, tried to sabotage Ghent's progress.\nFirst he tried to have Ghent eliminated in a fake training flight by giving him a derelict TIE fighter and ordering his wingmen to shoot him as an infiltratorâ€”a plan which backfired when Ghent's survival instincts were triggered and he used his piloting skills to destroy his attackers. When Ghent angrily confronted him, Millavec smooth-talked his way out by claiming that this had been a test, under Vader's orders.\nWhen the assassination failed, Millavec decided to recruit Black Eight from the ranks of the most murderous and insane conscripts held in the Imperial prisons. He figured that they will kill Ghent for him.\nHowever, Millavec's attempt on Ghent's life had the unforeseen effect of rekindling Ghent's will to live and thus making himself an enemy.",
