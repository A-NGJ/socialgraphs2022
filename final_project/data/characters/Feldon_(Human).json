 "content": "Feldon was a Human male agent of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY, he was among those Imperials spreading the riot on Belsavis. Feldon recruited the leader of the Condemned Nyranos to urge the prisoners to rise against the Republic. However, Nyranos had his own motives and was not averse to peaceful solution. When he voiced his desire to negotiate in Feldon's presence, he lost his use, and Feldon tried to kill him. Instead, Nyranos defeated him with the help of a Republic individual.",
