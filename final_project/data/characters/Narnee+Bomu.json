 "content": "Narnee Bomu was a male Rodian soldier and a member of the Bomu Clan.\nHe worked for Vago the Hutt and the Anjiliac kajidic along with a number of his clan during the reign of the Galactic Empire.\nNarnee and another Bomu soldier, Seedar Bomu, was hired by Vago to find a treacherous partner of Popara who had stolen one hundred thousand credits in spice. Vago, not completely trusting the Bomus, put tracker devices in their ship. The Bomus killed the buyer of the spice with a sudden explosion, although it is unclear if they managed to recover the spice - Some believe that Vago had to send bounty hunters with the same prey after the Bomus' failure.",
