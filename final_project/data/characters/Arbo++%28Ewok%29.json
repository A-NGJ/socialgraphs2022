 "content": "Arbo was an Ewok who lived in Bright Tree Village on the Forest Moon of Endor as the village's legend keeper. When it was revealed that the wokling Malani had been kidnapped, Arbo suggested that the Ewoks ask their shaman, Logray, for advice before any decisions were made.\nArbo was an Ewok member of the Bright Tree Village tribe on the Forest Moon of Endor. The legend keeper of Bright Tree Village, Arbo was a sage member of the tribe. At one point, a band of Duloks entered Happy Grove, the area around Arbo's village; the visitors, led by King Vulgarr, claimed that a giant creature had kidnapped Malani, one of the village's young woklings. Vulgarr implored the Ewoks to send as many warriors as they could spare to fight the beast and reclaim the child, but Arbo urged caution and suggested that they consult the shaman, Logray, first.\nNevertheless, Chief Chirpa, the leader of Bright Tree's Ewoks, ordered the tribe's warriors to pursue the creature. Once the shaman had arrived, Arbo quickly told him the story. However, Chirpa's strategy to leave the women and elders to guard the village and its woklings left the village vulnerable, allowing Vulgarr and his band to take advantage of the lowered village defenses by kidnapping the remaining children. Arbo's name was shared by the Arbo Maze, a cave located on Endor.\nArbo was a great admirer of Logray, urging that the Ewoks consult with him prior to making a decision.\nArbo first appeared in The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense, a young-readers book written by Joe Johnston and published in 1984.",
