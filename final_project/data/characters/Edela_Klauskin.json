 "content": "Edela Klauskin was the deceased wife of Admiral Matric Klauskin who appeared to him as a spirit created by Dark Lady of the Sith Lumiya and used for his manipulation aboard Dodonna. She had long brown hair, streaked with gray and worn in an older Coruscanti style. She was slightly overweight and never wore jewelry.\nLater she appeared again when Matric Klauskin was in Veterans' Mental Care Hospital care and, through Lumiya's Sith manipulation, helped him escape. This time she appeared younger, less overweight, and with no gray streaks in her hair, while wearing a burgundy synthsilk gown.",
