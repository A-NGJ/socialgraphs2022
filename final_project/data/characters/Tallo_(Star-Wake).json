 "content": "Tallo was a Human male who was the eldest son of Bordon, and the older brother of Wend.\nIn 1000 BBY, he joined his father, brother, and the pilot Irtanna on a rescue effort on his homeworld of Ruusan after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, aboard the Envoy-class shuttle Star-Wake.\nAfter the crew picked up Darth Zannah—of whose allegiance to the Sith they were unaware—during one of the rescue missions, Tallo was killed by the Sith apprentice after struggling with her over a blaster. Following his death, Zannah murdered the rest of the crew of the Star-Wake as well.",
