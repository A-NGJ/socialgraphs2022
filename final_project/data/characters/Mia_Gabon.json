 "content": "Mia Gabon was a human female military pilot who served the New Republic in the years following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War. Gabon served in the Starfighter Corps of the New Republic Defense Force during the Cold War.\nIn 34 ABY, during the Cold War, Mia Gabon served in the New Republic Defense Force's Starfighter Corps as the pilot of a T-85 X-wing starfighter. Along with two other pilots, Kazuda Xiono and Hugh Sion, she was sent on a mission to rendezvous with Commander Poe Dameron of the Resistance in order to deliver intelligence. Shortly after arriving at the rendezvous point, the three pilots were ambushed by Major Elrik Vonreg of the First Order, and she and Sion were concerned that they wouldn't be able to complete their mission. Xiono ordered her and Sion to escape into hyperspace as he covered them, promising to follow right behind them.\nGabon was a female human with brown eyes and light skin.\nMia Gabon was a character developed for the Star Wars Resistance animated series. She was voiced by Cherami Leigh.",
