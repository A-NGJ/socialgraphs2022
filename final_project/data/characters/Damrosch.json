 "content": "Damrosch was a Hutt who allied the Galactic Republic during the time of the Cold War. He believed that Betterlife Pharmaceuticals was a front company of an Imperial research group, but needed the Jedi to help him prove it.\nDuring the Cold War period, Damrosch the Hutt was already a very influential resident of Nar Shaddaa, and he could be usually seen at the Lower Industrial region of the planet, where he managed to build a factory.\nHe became convinced that Betterlife Pharmaceuticals was an Imperial front organization when he realized that they were abducting men of the streets for their experiments, an action which he found offensive. Since he had no way to prove it, he requested help from an individual, instructing him to steal an access card from one of the scientists inside Betterlife Pharmaceuticals and use it to access one of their security terminals and get all the information needed.",
