 "content": "Palak-Ti was a male Rattataki prisoner who broke out of the Belsavis prison during a break around 3641 BBY. He was killed in the Rattataki Battlewoods sometime after breaking out.\nPalak-Ti appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Belsavis. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by characters of both factions or loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
