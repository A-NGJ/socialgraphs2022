 "content": "Kasso Trelek was a Weequay demolitions expert who worked freelance with N1-FEX and Tera. Trelek once spoke about how to run a mercenary band after ten years of experience.\nAt one point, he and his team were at a spaceport when they were attacked by Vols. During the fight, Trelek threw what he thought was a decoy thermal detonator, but it was a real one, and blew up the cantina they were in. Tera then called for them to leave.\nKasso Trelek appears in the opening story in Fantasy Flight Games' roleplaying game sourcebook Dangerous Covenants.",
