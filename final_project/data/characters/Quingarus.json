 "content": "Quingarus was a Toong droid factory owner.\nQuingarus owned the Quingarus Deluxe Droid Systems Factory on a planet close to the Coruscant system. He took up a loan with the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and during the Clone Wars, the organization later threatened him to build a new type of battle droid for them to repay his debt.\nQuingarus refused to switch his production lines to suit their demands, complaining that his family would starve as a consequence. He was saved from their battle droids by the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had landed in the factory to get his astromech repaired. Kenobi convinced him to accept Republic aid by making an agreement to have all the Republic's astromechs maintained at Quingarus' factory, thus helping him pay back his loan easily.",
