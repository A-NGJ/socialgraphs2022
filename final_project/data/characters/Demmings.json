 "content": "Commander Demmings was an officer in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire, as well as an intermediary between the government and the Tiss'sharl League on Tiss'sharl.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Commander Demmings was serving in the Outer Rim Territories, primarily as an adjutant to Lord Darth Vader and as captain of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Reprisal, the current command ship of his superior. In this capacity, he played a prominent role in the hunt for the elusive Rebel Fleet , and the final pacification of Jabiim. Commander Demmings accompanied Lord Vader on his third visit to the Tiss'shar on Tiss'sharl. During the conferential dinner, the latter Supreme Commander introduced him to their hosts as the new local Imperial Liaison, replacing the late Moff Giiedt whose suspicious demise was owed to the internal strife within the planet's leadership.",
