 "content": "Ilyana was a Dathomirian female Nightsister and member of Mother Talzin's clan who resided on Dathomir during the Clone Wars. She was close to her fellow Nightsister Merrin, who would sneak out with her to make potions in the swamps and believed they would be together when they were older. Ilyana was killed during the massacre of the Nightsisters by General Grievous and the droid army on the orders of Separatist leader Count Dooku. Merrin, who survived the attack, was forced to bury Ilyana along with the rest of the Nightsisters.\nYears after the massacre and the end of the Clone Wars, Merrin still remained on Dathomir until she met the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, and she told him the story of Ilyana's death and the massacre. After joining the crew of the Stinger Mantis, she also told former Jedi Knight Cere Junda about Ilyana.",
