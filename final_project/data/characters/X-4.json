 "content": "X-4 was a Human male assassin who, along with six other men, was hired to participate in Project Omega. An experiment by the Galactic Empire to create the perfect assassin, which was overseen by Commander Rezi Soresh. Soresh wiped the participants' identities from a database system and had their faces surgically altered. He then started his reconditioning program, which was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their memories and emotions.\nAt first, X-4 became friends with X-1, X-2, X-3, X-5, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-4, like the others, had his personality and mind changed completely until he felt no emotions. Around 10 BBY, they were pitted against each other in combat until only one remained. X-4 committed suicide by hanging himself with a laser whip. X-7 later earned the right to become Soresh's personal assassin.\nX-4 appeared in a flashback sequence in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published in 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler.",
