 "content": "The Sand People chieftain was the leader of a Sand People tribe residing in an enclave within the Dune Seas of Tatooine, southwest of Anchorhead during the Jedi Civil War.\nIn 3956 BBY, Revan and the crew of the Ebon Hawk arrived on the desert world in search of the Rakatan Star Map located there. When he and his party stole into the Sand Peoples' enclave wearing robes taken from a dead ambush party, ostensibly on a mission for Czerka Corporation to destroy the Sand People, they were able to meet with the chieftain and discuss terms for a cessation of hostilities, thanks to HK-47's translation abilities. In exchange for providing the tribe with moisture vaporators so that they could build up supplies of water, the chieftain agreed to move the tribe further away from the settlement and reduce their attacks on miners. Revan asked for the attacks to stop completely, but the chieftain said it would never happen because outsiders were constantly desecrating their customs and they needed to respond accordingly. Revan agreed to the deal and promised to give him the vaporators. The chieftain said he would wait but he did not believe the Jedi would return.\nWhen Revan does unexpectedly return with the vaporators, the chieftain then agreed to release a trio of captive Jawas in addition to Griff, the elder brother of Twi'lek party member Mission Vao. Though the chieftain stated he still did not trust Revan, he presented his gaffi stick to the Jedi as a gesture of good faith. Eventually, the chieftain led his people to another part of Tatooine.\nIn one alternate ending, the chieftain allows Revan and his party to free Griff Vao and the imprisoned Jawas in exchange for a krayt dragon pearl.\nIn the dark side ending, Revan somehow gives the Sand People cause to attack him, thus resulting in the party killing the entire Sand People tribe. Though it is not always dark sided. If Revan talks to the chieftain without HK-47, the tribe will attack.\nIf the player uses HK-47 to negotiate peacefully they can still have the chieftain and his tribe attack Revan if the player attempts to open any of the containers in the Enclave.\nIf Revan talks to the chieftain about their history he can learn that there is one storyteller in the village. You must first prove yourself as a warrior by killing a krayt dragon and bring back the pearl. The chieftain doesn't believe you will do this but when you do, you can bring him the pearl and you will gain access to the Storyteller. There you can learn the mysterious history of the Sand People. If you're not careful asking questions despite HK-47's warnings the whole tribe may attack.",
