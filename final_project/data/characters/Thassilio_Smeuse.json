 "content": "Thassilio Smeuse was a human male who operated as a deep-cover spy for the Rebel Alliance. During the Galactic Civil War, Smeuse posed as an officer of the Galactic Empire on the world of Ozri II. He was extracted by Captain Magna Tolvan and her rebel strike team, who took him to the rebel base on the planet Hoth to be debriefed.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Thassilio Smeuse worked as a deep-cover operative for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was placed as a spy in the Galactic Empire, posing as an Imperial officer. During his time as a spy in the Imperial Officer Corps, Smeuse was assigned to the swamp world Ozri II, and was in command of a unit of stormtroopers. At some point, Smeuse spoke with a comms jockey aboard the Imperial flagship Executor, hearing that the Empire's search for the rebel base had been sabotaged.\nSmeuse's stormtroopers captured members of the Rebel Alliance Strike Team Misericorde, who had faked engine failure so that they could be caught by the Imperials. Called to the area where the team had been captured, Smeuse confronted the rebel strike team. To Smeuse's surprise, one of the rebels, Captain Magna Tolvan, used a rebel code phrase, which Smeuse responded to, confirming his identity as a spy. The rebels escaped captivity and opened fired on the stormtroopers, and Tolvan extracted Smeuse, leaving Ozri II in a U-wing starfighter.\nEvading a number of Imperial TIE fighters, the rebels returned to their secret base on the planet Hoth, where Smeuse met with the Rebel Alliance. The rebels debriefed Smeuse, learning the information that he had picked up while working as a spy. Commander Luke Skywalker, after hearing the description of the individual who had sabotaged the Imperial search, deduced that it had been the archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, and relayed that information to Captain Tolvan, along with Aphra's father Korin and former ward Vulaada Klam.\nA human male, Thassilio Smeuse had light brown hair, dark eyes, and light skin. While posing as an Imperial officer, Smeuse acted disdainful of the Rebel Alliance, but secretly worked for them.\nWhile working as a spy in the Galactic Empire, Thassilio Smeuse wore an Imperial military uniform.\nThassilio Smeuse first appeared in \"Epilogue,\" a comic story written by Simon Spurrier, illustrated by Caspar Wijngaard, and published in Empire Ascendant 1 by Marvel Comics on December 18, 2019.",
