 "content": "A human male speeder pilot worked with a Kubaz ferryman to transport customers on the ice planet Pagodon with his landspeeder. In 9 ABY, he drove a bounty hunter known as Din Djarin and his bounty across the ice to Djarin's gunship. After dropping off the pair and driving away, the driver was killed by a ravinak which broke the ice beneath the pilot's landspeeder and dragged it into the water below.\nA human male worked as a speeder pilot on the ice planet Pagodon shortly after the fall of the Galactic Empire. He worked with a Kubaz ferryman to get customers who would pay for transport. In around 9 ABY, the ferryman summoned the pilot by playing a flute as a bounty hunter known as Din Djarin was seeking to return to his starship with a Mythrol prisoner.\nThe pilot agreed to the fare and drove the pair across ice fields in his landspeeder, checking ahead for ravinaks and warning them to watch out for the dangerous creatures. After dropping the Mandalorian and his bounty off at the gunship Razor Crest, the human piloted his speeder away, only to be killed when a ravinak shattered the ice beneath his vehicle and pulled it into the waters below.\nThe pilot had fair skin, blue eyes and brown hair.\nThe pilot drove a red landspeeder that was in a state of disrepair by the time of his final trip across the ice fields. He wore a brown coat with a fur lined hood and a pair of goggles and used a pair of binoculars to check for ravinaks.\nThe speeder pilot appeared in the first episode of the 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, which aired on November 12, 2019. He was portrayed by Brian Posehn.",
