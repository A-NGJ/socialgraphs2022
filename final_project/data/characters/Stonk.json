 "content": "Stonk was a male Ithorian Senator who served in the Galactic Republic Senate during the Clone Wars.\nStonk, a male Ithorian served as a senator in the Galactic Senate of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. At one point during the war, Senator Stonk was present in the Galactic Senate Chamber during the bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid.\nLater during the war, Senator Stonk retracted his vote from Naboo Senator Padm√© Amidala's proposal to stop the production of additional clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic, out of concern for public opinion, though he was very apologetic about it and personally contacted Amidala to explain his reason. Amidala, though understanding of Stonk's reasons, was nonetheless disappointed and spoke to her colleagues about Stonk's withdrawal.\nStonk first appeared in \"Senate Murders,\" an episode in the second season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars.",
