 "content": "Griph was a Falleen male who fell in love with a Twi'lek female sometime prior to 22 BBY. His lover intended to run away from her father with him. After consulting with his uncle, who had connections with the criminal Black Sun syndicate, he met with the Twi'lek in a cantina on the Mid Rim planet Ord Mantell. Griph told her about his uncle's affiliation with the Black Sun, but they were soon interrupted by several bounty hunters, who had been hired by the Twi'lek's father to return his daughter to him. Pointing blasters at the couple, one of the bounty hunters, the Rodian Neelda, told Griph to leave, and he ran away, leaving his lover behind to face the bounty hunters herself.\nGriph had green skin, green eyes, and black hair styled in a pony tail. He wore a gold and maroon colored shirt, blue pants, black footwear, and a black belt with a gold colored buckle and a blue device attached.\nGriph appeared in the comic Age of Republic - Jango Fett 1, written by Jody Houser, illustrated by Luke Ross, and released by Marvel Comics on January 9, 2019.",
