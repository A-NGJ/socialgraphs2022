 "content": "Berri was a female Twi'lek child from Tatooine who worked in the kitchens at Krayn's palace.\nShe and her mother Mazie were slaves in the spice-processing facilities on Nar Shaddaa. They helped Anakin Skywalker to provoke Krayn's slaves into revolting, resulting in their freedom.\nBerri herself, in her kitchen role, was able to retrieve Siri Tachi and Anakin Skywalker's lightsabers from Tachi's quarters , slipping the weapons through a food-delivery panel in the door of the high-security cell in which Berri's master had incarcerated the Jedi. Her courageous action allowed Tachi and Skywalker to escape their imprisonment by Krayn, but also to then initiate the slave revolt, which ultimately secured freedom for the slaves of Nar Shaddaa and ended with Skywalker's killing of the infamous pirate and crime-lord.",
