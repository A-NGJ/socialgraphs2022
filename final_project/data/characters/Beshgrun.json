 "content": "Beshgrun was a male Aqualish who became a member of a Separatist-aligned cell that operated on the planet Druckenwell during the Clone Wars. In about 21 BBY, Beshgrun became involved in plot by the cell to destroy a Republic Acclamator-class assault ship that was docked with the space station New Dawn in orbit of Druckenwell. To carry out the attack, Beshgrun and a group of pirates commanded by the Rodians Denma and Tazzik planned to fly to New Dawn aboard the stolen freighter First Light, then take control of the assault ship and record a holovid of the vessel's destruction, to broadcast to the rest of the galaxy. However, when Beshgrun and the rest of the pirates departed from Druckenwell in the First Light to initiate their raid, a team of freelance agents stowed away aboard the ship. The agents then attacked Beshgrun and the rest of the crew, preventing them from destroying the Acclamator assault ship.",
