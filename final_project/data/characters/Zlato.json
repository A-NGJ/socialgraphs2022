 "content": "Zlato was a Toydarian and professional thief. He and his alien friend worked Cloud City stealing from rich denizens.\nDuring one thieving escapade, his alien friend was nabbed by Lando Calrissian. The alien had been trying to steal an expensive pendant from the girlfriend of the current Baron Administrator, Dominic Raynor.\nJust as the alien was about to be taken into custody, he threw the pendant to Zlato, who began to fly away. Unfortunately, just after bragging of his legendary speed, Lando caught Zlato in his cape. Zlato and his alien friend were taken into custody by the Bespin Wing Guard.\nZlato means \"gold\" or \"money\" in a number of Slavic languages",
