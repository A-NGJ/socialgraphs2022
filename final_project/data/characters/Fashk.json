 "content": "Fashk was a male Flesh Raider who lived on Tython during the Cold War between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. As a descendant of mutated lower-caste Rakata, he was the first and only known Rakatan-related being that was able to touch the Force since the Rakata lost that ability due to a plague in 25,200 BBY.\nA Force-sensitive Flesh Raider, Fashk lived on the planet Tython where he resided in the Tythos Ridge during the Jedi Order's resettling of the planet during the Cold War. During a raid on the Pilgrims' Kalikori village, Fashk abducted a young Twi'lek boy named Viyo Kobbeth to use as an interpreter. When a traveling Padawan from the nearby Jedi Temple came looking for Kobbeth, Fashk abandoned the Flesh Raiders and revealed his desires to join the Order instead since he wanted to control his Force abilities through training. Fashk wished to become a better hunter through fine control of the Force, and the Padawan believed it would be best if the Flesh Raider could at least be evaluated by the Jedi Masters at the Temple. The Padawan also knew that if Fashk was left to his own devices, there was always a chance he could fall to the dark side. The Padawan then met with Jedi Master Strayen to discuss the issue, in which they agreed on the matter that he had to be trained. When the Padawan delivered the news along with a token to ensure Fashk's safe entry into the temple, the Flesh Raider released Viyo to the Padawan and immediately headed for the Temple.\nFashk is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.\nFashk can be encountered by either the future Hero of Tython or the future Barsen'thor as a side quest. The dark side choice involves Force Pushing him off the cliff into a fire pit.",
