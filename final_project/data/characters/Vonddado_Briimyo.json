 "content": "Vonddado Briimyo was a Neimoidian male who worked as a Mechanic during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Briimyo worked with the gangster Skavak and was forced to repair the ship, which belonged to the Smuggler Ace. He encountered Ace, who was here to find Skavak and retrieve the stolen Arkanian Hyperdrive. Briimyo was able to tell Ace where the Skavak was, and begged the smuggler to let him go. When Ace allowed to leave, Briimyo thanked the smuggler and fled.",
