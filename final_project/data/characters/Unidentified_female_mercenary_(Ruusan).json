 "content": "A Human female mercenary was a non-Force sensitive member of the Brotherhood of Darkness. She fled from the Seventh Battle of Ruusan after the Army of Light managed to break through the Brotherhood's defenses, and returned to the Sith camp. While scavenging treasures and supplies, she and a group of other mercenaries were attacked by Darth Bane.\nThe female and a male mercenary were the only survivors of the attack; five other mercenaries having been slaughtered by Bane. The two were later taken prisoner by the Jedi, who did not believe their words regarding the survival of the Sith, taking into account the two's reputation as liars.",
