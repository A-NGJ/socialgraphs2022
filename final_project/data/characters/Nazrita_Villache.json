 "content": "Nazrita Villache was a Human woman and chief mechanic for the Klatooinian Trade Guild syndicate on Boztrok. She gave Platt Okeefe a tour of her first ship, the Brentaal Princess. Villache had maintained the ship for the Guild and had installed a proton torpedo tube in the ship for extra firepower.\nShe reported to Pok Nar-Ten and would often install modification at his direction on unsuspecting smuggler's ships. She charged standard rates for repairs, although she was only supposed to charge 75% due to her use of the Klatooinian Trade Guild facilities. She would also occasionally be sent to repossess a ship back from a smuggler who had reneged on a deal.",
