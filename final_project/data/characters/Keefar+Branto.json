 "content": "Keefar Branto was a human male former criminal who lived during the High Republic Era. Becoming involved in numerous forms of crime, including gun-running, bounty hunting, and a brief stint as a member of the Nihil, Branto eventually attempted to turn over a new leaf, and was put on probation after the private detective Sian Holt vouched for him. Becoming Holt's partner, Branto was eventually placed on a top-secret mission for the Galactic Republic which even Holt was unaware of. In the course of the job, he associated with the criminal Urk Panga, attempting to insinuate himself into the Narquois' trust to find out what his current job was. However, Holt, who had a duty to monitor Branto via a tracking device as he was on probation, followed him, leading to the two being accosted by a Tarnab assailant who shot and killed Branto.",
