 "content": "A human male individual was present at Fondor on its shipyards during the First Order-Resistance War. When Resistance operatives came to Fondor looking for assistance, the individual refused to help them. Later the individual was captured by the First Order and was brought before Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, and explained that he had done nothing wrong. Ren, however, told him that he had been in contact with the Resistance, an act of treason. Ren informed him that the First Order would take control of Fondor and it's shipyards and executed him.",
