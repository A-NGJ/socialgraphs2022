 "content": "RF-1634 was a human stormtrooper who served in the 709th Legion of the First Order military regime. RF-1634 was stationed on the Outer Rim planet Batuu during the First Order's occupation there in 34 ABY with the 709th Legion. During the occupation, the stormtrooper made an announcement to all Batuuans, telling them that the 709th requested their cooperation at Black Spire Outpost. The trooper continued by stating that the First Order valued its loyalists, and that it would be a wise decision to aid the Order. RF-1634 wore First Order stormtrooper armor with a white pauldron.\nRF-1634 appeared in Star Wars: Datapad, an application launched alongside the themed land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios Park in 2019.",
