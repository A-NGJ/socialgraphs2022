 "content": "J'Meeb Gumb was a male Guineo criminal living during the last years of the Galactic Republic. In 32 BBY, he was working in the Industrial District of the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant at Haugg Nerf Industries, a death stick distributor operating under the guise of a nerf-packaging plant. Around that time, Gumb had a bounty placed on his head by an anonymous source for rigging the deck in a high-stakes match of sabacc. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett claimed the bounty on Gumb when Fett was infiltrating Haugg Nerf Industries in search of information on Komari Vosa, the leader of the Bando Gora, a secretive criminal organization.\nA male Guineo living during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, J'Meeb Gumb was a criminal as of the year 32 BBY. At some point during that year, Gumb worked for Haugg Nerf Industries, a death stick distributor disguised as a nerf-packaging plant, owned by an individual known as Groff Haugg. The facility was located in the Industrial District of the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant. While working at Haugg Nerf, Gumb received a bounty on his head for rigging the deck in a high-stakes sabacc match by using a skifter. An anonymous source offered a reward of 2,500 credits if Gumb was captured alive and 1,250 credits if he was simply killed. The bounty listed Gumb's last known location as the Coruscant Entertainment District. During the same year, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett infiltrated Haugg Nerf Industries while searching for information that would help him in his hunt for the five million credit bounty on Komari Vosa, a former Jedi and the leader of a secretive criminal cult known as the Bando Gora, which was rumored to be behind a large increase in death stick demand.\nDuring his infiltration of Haugg Nerf, Fett found Gumb near a control panel and captured him alive, claiming the bounty placed on the Guineo's head.\nLike many Guineo, J'Meeb Gumb had hairless, pale yellow skin, and stood over two meters in height. He was capable of rigging a sabacc match with the aid of a skifter, though doing so earned him a bounty on his head. Gumb also had some knowledge on how to use a blaster.\nDuring his time working for Haugg Nerf Industries, Gumb had a blaster that fired red energy bolts. He wore a yellow jumpsuit with a gray plate on its front and two silver-colored tanks attached to the back that each had a tube connecting them to the front of the suit. The jumpsuit he wore also had white stripes along the sleeves and around the collar. Gumb wore light-gray gloves and boots that were a darker gray. In addition, Gumb wore a pair of gray goggles.\nJ'Meeb Gumb made his first appearance in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, a video game produced by LucasArts and released in December 2002. Before appearing in the game, he received an entry in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, the game's corresponding guide, which was published by Prima Games and released in November of the same year. In the game, Gumb is one of five bounties located in the Industrial District, which is the second level on the game's second world.\nIn Bounty Hunter, the player controls Jango Fett, and since claiming Gumb's bounty is not essential to the game, the player has several ways to go about doing so. The player can ignore Gumb entirely, kill him and not claim the bounty, kill him and claim the bounty, or capture him and claim the bounty. This article assumes that Fett captured Gumb alive, as doing so gives Fett the maximum reward possible. J'Meeb Gumb's name is similar to the fictional serial killer Jame Gumb, who was the primary antagonist of the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which was based on a novel of the same name.",
