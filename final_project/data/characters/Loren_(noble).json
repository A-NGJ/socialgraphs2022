 "content": "Lady Loren was a Human female who was the consort of crown Prince Denid of Velmor during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Loren was betrothed to Denid in 17 BBY, when Imperial agents stirred up a revolt aimed at putting Denid's Imperial-friendly younger brother Anod on the throne. Denid and Loren escaped in a poorly equipped escape craft through the bravery of royal advisor Jedidiah, only for their ship to crash on the jungle world Tantajoc V.\nLoren died in the crash, but Denid and Jedidiah went on to survive for the next two decades in the harsh, wild environment of their new world. When Denid returned to Velmor to claim his crown in 3 ABY, one of his rescuers—Rebel leader Leia Organa—donned a blonde wig and posed as Loren in order to conceal Rebel involvement in the succession crisis.\nLoren first appeared in a flashback in Star Wars  49, written by Mike W. Barr and released in 1981.",
