 "content": "Rin Mako was a Nautolan Commander who lived during the Clone Wars. During the war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, he fought in a battle against the Separatists. He regretted the great losses among his people, saying that after the battle, it was not easy to suppress the memories of the battle, because so many died that parts of the seas of Glee Anselm became red with the blood of the fallen.",
