 "content": "Keiran Halcyon was a Human male Corellian Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic roughly four hundred years before the rise of the Galactic Empire and the start of the Great Jedi Purge.\nDiscovered to be Force-sensitive and inducted into the academy of the Jedi Order, Keiran Halcyon eventually passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Pursuing independent study along the path of the Jedi Guardian, Halcyon became a noted Corellian Jedi, taking on several missions that related to safeguarding his home system. One such accomplishment was the halting of the notorious and destructive Selonian Afarathu cult in 380 BBY. While designing his lightsaber, Halcyon imbued the weapon with a Durindfire gem, which gave his blade a unique silver color. Additionally, using Jedi techniques stored deep in the Jedi Temple's Archives, Halcyon was able to produce a lightsaber blade that could extend up to 3 meters in length.\nWhile strong in the Force, the Halcyon bloodline was known to be weak in telekinetic abilities, one of the abilities that Jedi were widely known for. However, instead of being weakened by this seeming impediment, those of the Halcyon family that became Jedi enhanced their gifts of alter mind to give them advantages where other Jedi might be weaker.\nLong after Halcyon's death, his bloodline produced at least two more Jedi, the famed Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon who served bravely during the Clone Wars, and Corran Horn. Horn was born into a time of conflict in the galaxy, when the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious outlawed Jedi training and strove to eliminate the Order's history from galactic records. However, as the Galactic Empire was overthrown and the Jedi Order rose from the ashes, Horn joined the fledgling Order under the name of his ancestor, Keiran Halcyon. Studying under Luke Skywalker at the Yavin 4 Jedi Praxeum, Horn eventually dropped the alias and went onto to become a prominent member of the Jedi High Council.\nThe Jedi Academy Training Manual mistakenly states that Keiran lived in the same era as Luke Skywalker, and was even his student for a brief time, while he in fact lived 400 years prior to Luke Skywalker's birth. This error is due to a retcon from the book I, Jedi, where it is revealed that the Keiran Halcyon that appeared in the Jedi Academy Trilogy was actually Corran Horn, a distant descendant of the original Halcyon. Horn used the alias upon Skywalker's suggestion, so that it would not become public knowledge that he was training as a Jedi.",
