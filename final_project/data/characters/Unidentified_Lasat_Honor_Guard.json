 "content": "During the Siege of Lasan, a male Lasat served in the Lasan High Honor Guard. He owned a J-19 bo-rifle. During the Siege, he fought Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus, and was defeated by him. Following the Lasat tradition of Boosahn Keeraw, he gave Kallus the bo-rifle before dying, as he had been bested by a superior opponent.\nThe Honor Guard is first mentioned in the Star Wars Rebels first season episode \"Droids in Distress.\" He is mentioned again in the Season Two episode \"The Honorable Ones,\" where more is learned about the exact circumstances under which Kallus fought him.",
