 "content": "Cyl Sant was a female Human from New Bornalex. She was married to a Theelin with whom she had a daughter, Rystáll.\nShortly after Rystáll's birth, Cyl moved to Coruscant to start a new life. But things didn't go as planned. Not having any credits left, she couldn't afford to raise a child and had to abandon her baby daughter. Desperate, she put Rystáll into the speeder of an Ortolan couple that was parked in the streets of Galactic City. She also left a note in which she asked them to take care of her child.",
