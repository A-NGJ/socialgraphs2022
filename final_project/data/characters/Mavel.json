 "content": "Mavel was a human individual who lived around 35 ABY. In that year Mavel traveled with another human aboard the star cruiser Halcyon as it undertook a cruise through the Mid Rim Territories. During the cruise, the ship was attacked by the crew of the pirate Crimson Jack, who sought the Resistance spy Shorr Komrrin. After the attack was successfully repeled, the Halcyon made its way to the tourist planet Sesid where Cimina, Komrrin's granddaughter, delivered secret Resistance codes to the Resistance member Vi Moradi. As Cimina delivered the information, Mavel was present with their associate who expressed disbelief that pirates had attacked the ship, and that as a result the two should be given a discount on their next cruise.",
