 "content": "Argus Tanzer was a young, human male who served as a bureaucrat on board the Alderaan Flotilla, a group of starships carrying the surviving natives of his homeworld Alderaan. In the year 5 ABY, Tanzer was part of a meeting on board the flotilla Alderaanian escort frigate Sunspire to discuss the future of the flotilla and witnessed the delivery of the Death Star superweapon's remains by the New Republic to the Alderaanians.\nArgus Tanzer was a male human from the planet Alderaan who survived the destruction of his homeworld by the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon in the year 0 BBY. Following the loss of his homeworld, Tanzer at some point joined up with the Alderaan Flotilla, a group of starships carrying surviving Alderaanians that had been initially established by Princess Leia Organa and the Rebel pilot Evaan Verlaine.\nIn the year 5 ABY, Tanzer was serving as a bureaucrat on the flotilla, which was floating amongst the remains of Alderaan in the Alderaan system. He attended a meeting with the Regent Administrator Eglyn Valmor on board the Alderaanian frigate Sunspire where they and several other leading members of the flotilla discussed their people's future. Valmor wished to remain in the Alderaan system, but others like the former teacher Icar Orliss and the diplomat Janis Pol wished for the surviving Alderaanians to re-settle a new world. When Orliss produced a list of suitable planets they might choose from, Tanzer interjected, arguing that re-settling a new world was not as simple as picking from a list, since they would need to follow the process put in place by the New Republic, although he admitted no one knew what that process was.\nThe arguing within the meeting continued until it was interrupted by reports of several large vessels approaching the flotilla. Tanzer and the others were then shocked to see a number of New Republic vessels hauling the remains of the Death Star toward the flotilla, which fellow flotilla member Teven Gale then revealed he had worked with Organa and Verlaine to acquire for the flotilla as a resource. Valmor and Gale then suggested building a new space station from the superweapon's remains, although Orliss still remained stubborn on resettling elsewhere.\nTanzer was a young man in 5 ABY, and possessed a natural handsomeness that seemed as though he did not need to cultivate it. While speaking at the meeting he gestured with his hands, thrusting up his finger to emphasize a point. He smirked upon realizing the nature of the Death Star wreckage.\nArgus Tanzer appeared in the 2016 novel Aftermath: Life Debt, written by Chuck Wendig.",
