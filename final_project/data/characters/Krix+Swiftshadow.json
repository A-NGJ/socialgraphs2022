 "content": "Krix Swiftshadow was a human male that lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a Human male by the name of Krix Swiftshadow was present on the Blackguard, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer that was captured by the rogue Imperial Captain—and self-proclaimed Grand Admiral—Andal Sait. Sait had the intention of selling the vessel to the criminal organization Black Sun, of which Swiftshadow himself was a member. However, before these plans could come to fruition, a team of spacers boarded the Star Destroyer, and killed Swiftshadow after an intense battle against him and nine Stormtrooper Grenadiers loyal to Andal Sait.\nKrix Swiftshadow was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Krix Swiftshadow was added to the game as part of the \"Star Destroyer\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 8\" update, on November 1, 2007.",
