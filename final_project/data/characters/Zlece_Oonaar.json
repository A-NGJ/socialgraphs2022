 "content": "Zlece Oonaar was a male Human who served as an officer in the Imperial Navy. During the Galactic Civil War he was captain of the Victory-class Star Destroyer Crusader, partaking the Battle of Khuiumin.\nIn 11 ABY, Oonaar, having since left Imperial service, was a passenger on the Galaxy Chance when the Khuiumin Survivors raided the corvette to capture him and exact their revenge. After a show trial he was executed by being blown out of a decompression hatch into the vacuum of space. His gruesome death would later be used by Corran Horn to warn the Invids stationed on Courkrus that doom was coming for them, making Jacob Nive, the leader of the Survivors, believe that he saw Oonaar's ghost.",
