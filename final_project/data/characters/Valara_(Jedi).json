 "content": "Valara was a Cathar male Jedi Master of the Jedi Order during the war with the Sith Empire. For years, he operated on Imperial planets by helping Sith apprentices in doubt escape from their ruthless training and join the Jedi. While smuggling a group of Sith from Taris, he attracted the attention of an HK-51 assassin droid, who obtained the coded signal acolytes used to contact him. The droid considered Valara for elimination among two other targets.\nValara was mentioned Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011. He was originally slated to appear in game but the content was cut. His in game appearance is shown to be Cathar  in a datamined file found here.",
