 "content": "Randil Sal was the husband of Tiion Sal-Solo and father of Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan met Han Solo around 18 BBY and told him his dad died when he was only one year old. Randil was a wealthy man, and left Tiion in his will before dying. Tiion never recovered, and constantly wept. This made Thrackan angry and sad, as his mother was full of life when his father was alive.",
