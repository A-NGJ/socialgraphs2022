 "content": "Omal was a Human male who was a student of Sith history under the tutelage of Murk Lundi, who lived on Coruscant circa 38 BBY.\nOne of the best of Lundi's pupils, the youth trailed his classmate Norval to the world of Kodai. Upon arrival, they found their teacher attempting to recover a long-lost Sith holocron; Norval, however, wanted to obtain the artifact for himself. Through Omal's actions, the holocron was prevented from falling into the wrong hands, having been cast deep into the bowels of a geyser.\nSome time later, Omal and another of Lundi's students, Dedra, lived together on an unknown world.",
