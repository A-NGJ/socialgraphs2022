 "content": "Vax Potorr was a bald Human male, originally a thief from the underlevels of Coruscant. During the Sithâ€“Imperial War he decided to serve with the Fel Empire rather than the Galactic Alliance, who were protecting the Yuuzhan Vong. During this time he fought in the Battle of Botajef with Joker Squad. Potorr was responsible for killing the Mandalorian Vevec.\nAs of 137 ABY he was still assigned to Joker Squad, which was part of the 407th Stormtrooper Division of the Galactic Empire. During the Battle of Borosk, Joker squad led the assault on the 908th's citadel. He was the first casualty of Joker squad, when he stepped on a mine and was blown apart.\nA figure of Vax Potorr was created by Entertainment Earth and unveiled at Comic Con International 2008 as part of the Joker Squad action figure 6-pack.",
