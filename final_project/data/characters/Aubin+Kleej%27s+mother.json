 "content": "This individual was a female Gotal who lived during the time of the Old Republic. She was the lover of fellow Gotal Goethar Kleej, and together the two produced a son named Aubin. Around the time of the ignition of the Mandalorian Wars, the Gotal and the rest of her family were captured by The Crucible, a brutal slaving organization structured around aggression and violence.\nAubin had difficulties sorting through the extra-sensory signals that Gotals received through their cones, so he relied heavily on his mother to function on a day-to-day basis. His dependency was particularly pronounced after Chantique, the leader of the slave ring, severed Goethar's horns, thereby depriving him of cone-reliant sensory information and the ability to connect with his son on that level. Aubin's mother was later killed by The Crucible, resulting in her son's descent into silent agony.\nAubin Kleej's mother received her first and only mention in Knights of the Old Republic 40, an issue of the Knights of the Old Republic comic series.",
