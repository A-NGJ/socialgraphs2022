 "content": "Zalg was a Toydarian male who lived on the planet Formos during the reign of the Galactic Empire. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Zalg was present in the Rii Jenks Cantina on Formos, where he spotted a group of off-world individuals who were investigating the seizure the the astromech droid R4-W9 by the smuggler Bandin Dobah. Zalg listened on their conversation and then made his way to the safehouse of a group of smugglers led by the Human Daro Blunt, who was connected to Dobah's smuggling ring, and he informed them of the off-worlders' activities. Blunt thanked Zalg for the information and paid the Toydarian 20 for the information.",
