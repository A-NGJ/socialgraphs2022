 "content": "Nyris Ko was a female Cathar living during the war against Zakuul. Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, she and her family member Icarr Ko joined Doctor Alirra Semhess' group of rogue Republic scientists who worked on a secret project on the X7-Cratus space station. Eternal Alliance operatives under Theron Shan eventually discovered Semhess and her project and a strike team was dispatched to X7-Cratus to stop RS-33 adrenal from becoming a galactic threat. Alliance forces engaged and defeated Marlon Fenn, but during their fight the station's containment systems were damaged and RAK-5 serum started leaking into atmosphere. Icarr and Nyris Ko engaged the intruders in the infected state and after turning into rakghouls mid-fight, both were killed the Alliance personnel.\nNyris Ko appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as a boss during the \"Trial and Error\" Uprising.",
