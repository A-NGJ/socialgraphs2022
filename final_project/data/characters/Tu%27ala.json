 "content": "Tu'ala was a female Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the decade marked by the Separatist Crisis which plagued the Galactic Senate.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Tu'ala was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, studying at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Selected to train as the Padawan of Jedi Master Zuth, Tu'ala constructing a blue-bladed lightsaber to wield on her missions with her master. One of Zuth's most important lessons he taught to Tu'ala was his explanation that sometimes the death of a single individual was necessary to ensure others could fulfill their destiny; a lesson Tu'ala had trouble understanding. She lost her Master some time prior to the Clone Wars, when he died saving some politicians from attempted assassination.\nObtaining the rank of Jedi Knight, Tu'ala was part of Mace Windu's Jedi strike team sent to Geonosis to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padm√© Amidala from the Separatist leaders just prior to the start of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. At the First Battle of Geonosis, she finally gained comprehension of Zuth's meaning and laid down her own life, taking a shot from a Geonosian soldier that was meant for Anakin Skywalker. Her effort went unnoticed and unappreciated; nevertheless, her deed allowed Skywalker to live on and, eventually, to destroy Darth Sidious and return balance to the Force.",
