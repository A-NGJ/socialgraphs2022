 "content": "Qwallo Mode was a Duros Jedi Knight who served in the New Jedi Order during the time following the Second Galactic Civil War. He was believed to have perished during a mission in 42 ABY. In 43.5 ABY, he was seen alive by both Luke Skywalker and Ben Skywalker during their journey into the Maw Cluster, where they saw him breathing in the vacuum of space, armed with a rocket launcher.\nThe Skywalkers eventually found Mode in Sinkhole Station, a space station in the Maw. Mode had become a Mind Walkerâ€”a member of a group of Force-sensitives living at Sinkhole Station that were known for their ability to separate their minds from their bodies in order to travel in a realm of the Force known as beyond shadows. The Skywalkers met him in the meditation chamber of the station, and he begged them to let him rest beyond shadows. They granted him his wish, allowing him to die.",
