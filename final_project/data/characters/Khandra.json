 "content": "Khandra was a female human Jedi who served in the final years of the Galactic Republic. When Order 66 was initiated by Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars, Khandra went into hiding in a Jedi shrine on Anoat accompanied by three others, Mususiel, Zubain Ankonori, and Nuhj. Eventually, their haven was discovered by the Galactic Empire, who dispatched an Inquisitor to deal with them. Mususiel remained on Anoat to buy her companions time while they escaped.\nOn Mataou, Ankonori led their new adversary away while Khandra fled with Nuhj to Burnin Konn. With both Mususiel and Ankonori slain by the Inquisitor, Khandra lost her sense of identity as a Jedi, being forced to live in hiding and scrounge for food. At some point, the Inquisitor returned and killed both Khandra and Nuhj in a fight at a chromium mine near Wickridge. Their belongings, including a damaged lightsaber, were sealed in an Imperial vault on Nar Hypa.",
