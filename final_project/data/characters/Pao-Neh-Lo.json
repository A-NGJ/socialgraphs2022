 "content": "Pao-Neh-Lo was an experienced Tiss'shar pirate. She was cold-hearted and showed little mercy but was highly disciplined and would follow a strong leader to the end. Like most of her species, she wore no clothes apart from a tool harness from which she hung weapons. Pao-Neh-Lo had an impressive array of weapons including a Power 5 heavy blaster pistol, hold-out blaster, vibroblade, vibrodagger, grenades and detonite.\nWhile on StarForge Station Pao-Neh-Lo responded to a call by Captain Dhas Vedij to join the crew of the Rebel privateer vessel Far Orbit.",
