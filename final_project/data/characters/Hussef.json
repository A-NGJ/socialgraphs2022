 "content": "A Human male, Hussef was the benevolent, unofficial leader of the refugees in the refugee sector on Nar Shaddaa. Following the Jedi Civil War many refugees found their way to Nar Shaddaa, and Hussef tried to look out for them by keeping them together, safe, and in high spirits.\nTheir troubles began to worsen when a gang of displaced veterans from Serroco moved into the skyramp and kicked the refugees out by force, and then the Exchange further boxed them into the cramped compound, imprisoning them with the threat of kidnappings and violence. Hussef believed that the Exchange was was doing this to break their spirits so they could be sold to the Hutts as slaves, despite that the Exchange was powerful enough to enslave them all through force anyways.\nThe refugee's problems grew progressively worse for months, until the fateful day that Meetra Surik would travel there. Her meeting with Hussef would have a profound impact on the refugee's lives, and Nar Shaddaa for years to come.\nIn the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, the player as the Jedi Exile could talk to Hussef to gather information on the Exchange and current activities. Hussef asks the player to help the refugees by dealing with the Serroco gang and Exchange Overseer Saquesh, which the player may accomplish either through diplomacy or violence. By doing so the player could advance the story by angering the Exchange.\nAlternatively, the player could gain the Exchange's favor by convincing Hussef that the refugees had no choice but to willingly sell themselves into slavery for the Hutts, after having Geriel killed and Adana sold to the Hutts.\nEven though Hussef had a unique appearance made for his video game appearance, Hussef's character appears as a generic Caucasian Human commoner, presumably by programming error.",
