 "content": "Bala Waleen was a Twi'lek male spicerunner and merchant who staged a coup and usurped rule of the Ryloth colony planet Aaloth during the High Republic Era. He was the boyfriend of Lourna Dee, whose father Yudiah Dee was the Keeper of Aaloth prior to Bala's coup.\nBala conspired with Lourna to depose her father as the world's Keeper, and the family's palace was stormed by a mob of starving citizens. Waleen betrayed Lourna, selling her into slavery to the Zygerrian Alliance and having the rest of her family executed.\nDee later killed Bala in revenge in a raid on Aaloth.\nBala Waleen appeared in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast. Bala was voiced by Sullivan Jones in that audio production",
