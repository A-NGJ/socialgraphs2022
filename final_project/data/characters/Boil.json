 "content": "\"Boil\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic as a member of Ghost Company during the Clone Wars. Boil and his fellow clone trooper \"Waxer\" were considered two of the best soldiers in Ghost Company.\nThe clone trooper known as \"Boil\" served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He served with the 212th Attack Battalion's Ghost Company—led by Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody.\" He developed a close friendship with a fellow trooper, \"Waxer.\" Early in the war, Boil was part of squad led by Waxer during a mission to investigate whether clone POWs were being kept on Krystar. He also took part in the siege of Hisseen and helped rescue the Hisseenian parliament from battle droids.\nLater in the war, Ghost Company was sent to the planet Ryloth to liberate the Twi'lek prisoners from the Separatist Droid Army. While scouting the abandoned city of Nabat, Boil and Waxer came across the young orphaned Twi'lek child Numa, who led them to discover that the rest of the city's citizens were being held prisoner by Separatist battle droids in the city's center. Under General Kenobi's leadership, Boil and the other soldiers of Ghost Company succeeded in freeing the Twi'leks while also destroying the Separatists' proton cannons.\nBoil and Waxer continued to serve together following the liberation of Ryloth; during the Second Battle of Geonosis, the two clones were ordered by Commander Cody to rescue General Kenobi after his Republic gunship was shot down by Separatist forces. They successfully completed their mission, avoiding enemy fire and retrieving the Jedi General along with another survivor, the clone trooper known as \"Trapper.\" Boil also saw action in the Battle of Kiros while still serving in Kenobi's 212th Attack Battalion.\nNear the end of the war, Boil joined clone troopers \"Threepwood\" and \"Tracker\" as they accompanied Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in a search for Quinlan Vos, Count Dooku, and Asajj Ventress on the planet Christophsis. After inspecting the crash site of the fugitives' ship Banshee, the clones and the Jedi determined that the fugitives were still alive but at least one of them was wounded. Shortly after, they attacked the Separatist base on the planet.\nYears later, Numa—now a resistance fighter in the Free Ryloth Movement—wore a piece of armor on her left arm with the word \"Boil\" written in Aurebesh.",
