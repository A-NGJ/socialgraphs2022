 "content": "KY-1661 was a human male stormtrooper who served in the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps. In 14 BBY, during his secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order, the Jedi Padawan overheard two of KY-1661's fellow stormtroopers discuss how KY-1661 had apparently been permanently assigned to garbage duty after not following patrol procedures. One of the stormtroopers feared that they would also be assigned to garbage duty, to which the other assured that stormtrooper that if they followed proper procedures, they would not.\nKY-1661 was first mentioned in the 2019 canon video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order developed by Respawn Entertainment.",
