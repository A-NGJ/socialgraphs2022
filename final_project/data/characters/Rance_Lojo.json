 "content": "Rance Lojo was a male Ithorian who was rescued from Imperial forces by the Spectres. Following his rescue, the Ithorian was given shelter in the secret rebel settlement known as the Haven. Lojo considered the possibility of seeking out a new home, if the damage done to Lothal by the Empire were to continue unabated.\nAfter being rescued, Lojo expressed gratitude to one of the Spectres for aiding him and his fellow citizens, claiming that the rebels' deeds would have lasting impact and be remembered.",
