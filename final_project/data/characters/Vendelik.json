 "content": "Vendelik was a male Human private in the Sith Empire during the Conquest of Makeb.\nVendelik was the son of a Makeb mining foreman and joined the Sith Empire in order to defend his homeworld. However, he was mortally wounded by Hutt Cartel forces, and was later found by a Galactic Republic strike team. Vendelik informed the Republic team that in order to stabilize the core, they had to reduce the pressure by venting the emergency release valves. Taking over the primary control center, the Republic team managed to vent the massive heat buildup in the planet's core, buying enough time to obtain the fuel rods.\nPrivate Vendelik was featured in the 2013 expansion Rise of the Hutt Cartel to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. His model was introduced in the SWTOR game files in version 1.3, but was only used for the game in the expansion 2.0, Rise of the Hutt Cartel.",
