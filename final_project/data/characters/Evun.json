 "content": "Evun was a male Human hailing from the Mid Rim world Ord Mantell. Evun was married to Alva and had two children. Together with his wife's teenage brother Theel, Evun and the four were nomads who lived in the Scraplands salvaging waste for profit. During the Galactic Civil War, Evun and his family were ambushed by Savrips on their journey to Fifth Wheel. Wearing survival gear and a homemade slugthrower rifle, Evun and Alva attempted to hold off the Savrips while Theel guarded the children.",
