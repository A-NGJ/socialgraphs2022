 "content": "A human female comms officer served in a Galactic Empire remnant led by Moff Gideon. In 9 ABY, she liaised with an informant on tracking the Force-sensitive infant Grogu and brought news to Gideon when a tracker had been placed on the gunship Razor Crest where the child was being kept.\nGideon's light cruiser tracked the Razor Crest to the planet Tython, destroying the gunship. The comms officer reported to Gideon that his dark troopers were ready, and the moff had the troopers capture Grogu. After, the comms officer joined Gideon in visiting the infant, soon receiving orders to contact Doctor Pershing. The comms officer later alerted the moff to a message from the Mandalorian Din Djarin, who wished to liberate Grogu from Gideon's remnant.\nWhen the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle designated Shuttle 2743 arrived from hyperspace near Gideon's cruiser, the comms officer acknowledged the shuttle's request to dock but soon ordered the starship to keep clear for deploying TIE fighters. The shuttle failed to comply, and so the officer ordered the TIEs to keep clear of the launch tube. Djarin and his associates exited the shuttle and engaged the personnel on board.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, the comms officer served in a remnant of the Galactic Empire led by Moff Gideon, holding the rank of lieutenant. She served on Gideon's light cruiser in 9 ABY. While serving aboard the cruiser, the comms officer was contacted by a Mimbanese informant who confirmed to her that the Force-sensitive infant Grogu, whom Gideon was seeking out, was still in the possession of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin aboard his gunship the Razor Crest. After the informant told her that a tracking beacon had been installed on to the Razor Crest during its repairs on planet Nevarro, she thanked the Mimban native, promising rewards in the \"new era.\" The comms officer made her way to Gideon, informing him of the news she had received from the informant.\nGideon's light cruiser tracked the Razor Crest to the planet Tython, where Gideon's stormtroopers fought Djarin and two of his associates, the assassin Fennec Shand and the Mandalorian Boba Fett. The cruiser soon destroyed the Razor Crest while the gunship was parked on the ground. When Gideon asked if his dark troopers had engaged, the comms officer reported that the troopers were deploying momentarily, and four dark troopers then flew down to apprehend Grogu at a temple ruin. Once the infant had been taken aboard the light cruiser, the vessel escaped into hyperspace. The comms officer later joined Gideon as he inspected and taunted Grogu. After the moff had the infant stunned, he ordered the officer to send a message to Doctor Pershing once they exited hyperspace, the comms officer acknowledging his order.\nSometime after, the comms officer, backed by an Imperial gunnery officer, alerted Gideon to a holographic message from the Mandalorian. It was simply a recording by Djarin claiming that Gideon underestimated the value of Grogu and that the infant would be back in the Mandalorian's custody shortly. The comms officer and gunnery officer stood aside the table displaying the message as Gideon witnessed it for himself.\nA short while later, the comms officer was at her terminal when the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle designated Shuttle 2743 arrived out of hyperspace near Gideon's cruiser under pursuit from the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I. The comms officer noticed the starships on her scanners and heard as Bo-Katan Kryze requested emergency docking. The officer acknowledged the request, believing that Kryze was an Imperial pilot, and Gideon ordered for TIE fighters to be launched. The comms officer advised Shuttle 2743 to stay clear of the cruiser's launch tube where the TIEs were deployed. As TIE fighters deployed to engage the Slave I, the shuttle failed to change course from the launch tube, and so the comms officer insisted that the vessel must keep clear until the fighters have deployed.\nThe pilot belayed the comms officer's order, stressing that the Shuttle 2743 was under attack, and so the officer gave orders over comm that the launch tube be cleared immediately. The hangar soon stopped deploying TIEs shortly thereafter to allow the shuttle to land, the Slave I breaking pursuit and escaping in the meantime. In reality, the shuttle carried Djarin and his allies, who gunned down personnel in the hanger. Gideon ordered the activation of the dark troopers, and departed the bridge. Djarin's associates soon reached the bridge, eliminating the defending stormtroopers and officers.\nA human female, the comms officer had light skin, black hair, and brown eyes. She frequently spoke with Gideon and her associates with a neutral expression and voice. When thanking a Mimbanese informant, the officer promised the informant rewards in the \"new era.\" When Shuttle 2743 failed to stay clear of the cruiser's launch tube, the comms officer insistently ordered for the shuttle to stay clear, but gave in when the pilot failed to comply, remaining calm despite the tension resulted from the situation. She was very courageous and loyal to Gideon's Imperial remnant, fighting to defend the bridge of the light cruiser despite witnessing numerous stormtroopers being killed by the intruders.\nThe comms officer wore the standard uniform of an Imperial naval officer, including an Imperial kepi and two code cylinders attached below each shoulder. She wore a rank insignia plaque on her left breast with two red bars above two blue, which signified the rank of lieutenant. The officer was also armed with a SE-14r light repeating blaster which she wore on her right hip.\nThe officer first appeared in \"Chapter 12: The Siege\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Carl Weathers and released on November 20, 2020. Credited as \"Comms Officer,\" she was played by Katy O'Brian. In concept art for the officer, artist Brian Matyas made most his designs of the character with the Imperial officer's uniform having subtle tweaks. In one, he played around with a red palette Imperial officer's uniform for the character, not knowing whether it was a new concept. In another, the artist gave her a hat that mixed the design of those worn by officers of the Galactic Empire and the First Order as well as hats from Soviet-era Russia.\nAccording to O'Brian, she auditioned with no knowledge of what the role was for, with fake scripts being used for the audition itself, as the production was extremely secretive. She was cast for her role, without being called back for another audition, around a year prior to the release of \"Chapter 12: The Siege\" and her scenes were filmed in the US state of Georgia between December 2019 and February 2020, her final shoot being among the last scenes filmed. O'Brian claimed that she received her lines the night before as a secrecy precaution, and her Imperial uniform was one of the original costumes used during the filming of the Star Wars original trilogy.\nO'Brian added that while the name of Grogu, which had not yet been public, was in her script, she would choose to refer to \"Baby Yoda\" with different names in her mind like \"Crouton\" as Grogu would not stick for her. She found the Mandalorian set to be easier to work within, as it was a closed set with no external noise. Producer Dave Filoni gave the actor context to their role as a lieutenant and the props she was given. O'Brian fantasised her prop code cylinders as two lightsaber daggers.\nThe crew also gave O'Brian a thick gameboy-looking prop, which was a communicator prop from the original trilogy, to be the device she used to communicate with the Mimbanese informant. However, the console was used instead as director Weathers thought the prop was too big to use. In filming that scene, the actor spoke with a cardboard cutout of Din Djarin, with the light of the hologram being generated by a lightbox which O'Brian found very bright when the cutout was removed.\nShe also worked closely with Moff Gideon's actor Giancarlo Esposito, even meeting his children when they visited one day. O'Brian also begged her way into meeting the puppet and robotic models for Grogu. Upon the release of \"Chapter 12: The Siege,\" O'Brian received widespread support from her fans and the LGBT community, which she is a member of. According to O'Brian on Twitter, during filming of The Mandalorian she walked onto her scenes resounding \"The Imperial March\" in her head, which she matched the tempo of.",
