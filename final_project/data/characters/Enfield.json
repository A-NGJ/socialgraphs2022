 "content": "Sergeant Major Enfield was Human male Death Star trooper who served as a detention block guard in the first Death Star during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nEnfield often served as the representative of Lieutenant Shann Childsen. He was in command of the troops that were responsible for the detention block's security. He was also an interrogation technician.\nEnfield, alongside his senior tactical advisor, Corporal Grenwick, escorted Darth Vader to the then-imprisoned Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa's prison cell in order to interrogate her.\nWhen Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca attacked the detention block, trying to free Princess Leia, Enfield was killed in the resulting battle.\nEnfield was portrayed by Ron Conrad in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.",
