 "content": "A Human male served as a pilot in the Imperial Remnant's 181st Imperial Fighter Group in 13 ABY. He was one of four pilots who served as emissaries to the planet Adumar in that year; led by 181st commander Turr Phennir, they attempted to convince the government of the nation state of Cartann to join the Empire. Meanwhile, four New Republic pilots were also in Cartann City, arguing the New Republic's case. During their days on Adumar, the Imperial pilots engaged many local pilots in aerial duels to the death, which gained them considerable honor according to local customs.\nWhen Cartann declared war on the other nations of Adumar, the Imperials fought for them when forces of the Yedagon Confederacy attacked Cartann. The Human male was the first Imperial pilot to die, which happened when his TIE interceptor was shot down by concentrated fire from the New Republic pilots, who were fighting for the Confederacy.\nIn X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar, one of Phennir's men is described as being a tall, red-headed man. It is unclear if that man is the pilot described in this article or one of the two other men on Phennir's ambassadorial team.",
