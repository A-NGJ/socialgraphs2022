 "content": "Micah was the Cathar adoptive child of Nat Skywalker, then going by the alias \"Bantha\" Rawk, and Droo, and the step-sibling of Ahnah and Skeeto, who lived during the time of the Second Imperial Civil War. Micah had cybernetic legs, built by Nat himself.\nMicah was once a slave, but he was saved from his plight by \"Bantha Rawk\", also known as Nat Skywalker. However, Micah lost his legs in the escape. Nat's wife Droo healed the stricken Cathar to a certain extent, but his legs had to be replaced by cybernetic ones.\nMicah fought alongside his family in defending the Nest from Black Sun invaders. While piloting a speeder, he tricked one swoop into a wall with impressive piloting skills. His family was also assisted by the Mynock, piloted by Cade Skywalker, Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.\nFour days later, Micah and his family were enjoying an outdoor fun session. His family later watched the holonews about the Massacre on Mon Calamari, and it was then that Cade revealed that he was a Skywalker. Afterward, Micah and his family, except his father, moved to Kiffu.\nJan Duursema once referred to Micah as \"Micah Skywalker\" on TheForce.net message boards. However, that name to date has not been mentioned in any canonical source and, given that fact that Micah was unaware of his adoptive father's heritage, remains utterly speculative.",
