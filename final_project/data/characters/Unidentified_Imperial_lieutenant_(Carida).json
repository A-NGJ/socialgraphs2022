 "content": "A human Imperial officer served as a lieutenant within the Galactic Empire. By 10 BBY, the lieutenant accompanied Captain Tarl Sokoli to the Imperial Naval Academy on the planet Carida where Sokoli was to give a lecture. As the two made their way through the academy, Sokoli collided with a cadet named Beilert Valance. In response, the lieutenant threatened to have Valance punished, but the captain informed the officer that no punishment was necessary. Sokoli then briefly spoke with Valance, who he had met when Valance was a child, before he was informed by the lieutenant that they needed to leave as his speech was due to begin soon.",
