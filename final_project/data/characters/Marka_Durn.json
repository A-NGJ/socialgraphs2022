 "content": "Marka Durn was a Human trader during the Galactic Civil War and a friend of the Rebel Alliance. With his droid R2-C9, this expert navigator roamed the Nanth'ri Route in his battered Ghtroc freighter, DeepHopper.\nXishel, a Falleen, once employed Durn to locate the lost treasure of the famous pirate, Celis Mott. Durn found the treasure on a remote asteroid, but was killed on Xishel's orders soon after. However, Durn hid the location of Mott's treasure in the databanks of his starship's computer and Xishel was foiled.",
