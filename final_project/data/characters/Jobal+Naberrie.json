 "content": "Jobal Naberrie was a human female from the planet Naboo. A member of the Naberrie family, she was the mother of Sola Naberrie and Padmé Amidala. Her younger daughter, who was born Padmé Naberrie before assuming the name Amidala, served as queen and later as the representative of their homeworld in the Galactic Senate during final years of the Galactic Republic.\nAt some point Jobal married a man named Ruwee Naberrie and they had two daughters, named Sola and Padmé Naberrie.\nWhen Padmé turned fourteen years, she was elected Queen of Naboo and adopted the name of \"Padmé Amidala\".Successful and well-liked, she served two two-year terms, including during the Invasion of Naboo. Though she'd planned to retire from public life, Padmé was asked by her successor, Réillata, to represent Naboo in the Senate. That same day she informed Ruwee and Jobal of her decision.\nIn 28 BBY, Jobal's daughter Sola had her first baby, Ryoo; making Jobal a grandmother.\nShortly before the Clone Wars, her daughter Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker visited them.\nIn 19 BBY, following the end of the Clone Wars and the execution of Order 66, Jobal, Ruwee and Sola attended the funeral of Padmé after her death at Polis Massa.\nJobal Naberrie had brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nDuring her daughter's funeral, Jobal wore a black robe and black mourning cloak, with the dark tones reflecting the family's sadness and mourning at Amidala's death.\nIn deleted scenes for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, Jobal Naberrie was established as the mother of Padmé Amidala. She was portrayed by Trisha Noble, who reprised the role for Amidala's funeral in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.",
