 "content": "Eozlin was a Force-sensitive male Ithorian who lived in the village of Aurilia on the planet Dathomir during the time of the Galactic Civil War. His main responsibility in the village was to find resources to restore Aurilia's defenses, after it had been attacked by Dark Jedi Mellichae and his Sith Shadows.\nEozlin appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, but was removed as part the New Game Enhancements of 2005, along with Aurilia. Star Wars Galaxies was shut down on December 15, 2011.",
