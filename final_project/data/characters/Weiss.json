 "content": "Weiss was an Imperial general active during the height of the Galactic Civil War. A field commander, he often operated a heavily customized AT-ST walker.\nAt some point during the Galactic Civil War, Weiss and his forces proceeded to raid a Rebel-owned encampment on Dantooine. His forces successfully managed to capture several Rebel soldiers, although not before the Rebels hid key supplies within the camp.\nBeing an Imperial general and field commander, Weiss was dedicated to upholding order within the Galactic Empire, and frequently operated a heavily customized AT-ST walker. He also possessed a keen military mind, and was capable of deploying his forces to either charge the enemy or otherwise complete certain objectives while he himself focuses his firepower on any Rebel soldiers.\nWeiss is a character that was introduced in one of the Villain Packs of the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Imperial Assault.",
