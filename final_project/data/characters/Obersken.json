 "content": "Obersken was an elderly muscular Chiss male who served the Chiss Ascendancy and the Empire of the Hand coalition as the chief mechanic of the Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo training academy on the Unknown Regions planet Rhigar. During many of the Human cadet Jagged Fel's flights aboard his Nssis-class Clawcraft Blue Flame, the mechanic told Fel that the Chiss needed no heroes while scolding him for his rashness. During a flight exercise in 19 ABY, Fel crashed the Blue Flame, and Obersken rescued him with a bright red vehicle before scolding him. The chief mechanic had white hair.\nObersken appeared in the 2001 short story Red Sky, Blue Flame, which was written by Elaine Cunningham and published within the seventh issue of the Star Wars Gamer magazine.",
