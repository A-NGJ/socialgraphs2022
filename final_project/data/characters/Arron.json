 "content": "Arron was a human TIE fighter pilot in the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. The pilot took part in a mission to hunt down the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Hellion's Dare, but was killed in the Oridol Cluster by the time fighter wing's forces were able to eliminate their target. After taking charge of the 204th, Major Soran Keize wished to have Arron replace another fallen pilot, but instead learned of the former pilot's death.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the human pilot Arron served in the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. Some weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Arron took part in a mission to hunt down the New Republic EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Hellion's Dare as a part of an effort coordinated by Colonel Shakara Nuress, the 204th's commanding officer, to maintain the secrecy of the 204th's new base of operations in the Pandem Nai system.\nPart of two TIE/ln space superiority starfighter squadrons aboard the Quasar Fire-class cruiser carrier Aerie, numbering at thirty-two, Arron was with the attack force when it drove the Dare and it's two escort squadrons out of the Jiruus system and chased the New Republic forces through the Oridol Cluster. The 204th forces were able to almost completely eliminate the enemy, but not before Arron was killed. After becoming the fighter wing's new commanding offer, Major Soran Keize suggested having Arron replace another fallen pilot named Draige as second-in-command of Squadron Four, but instead learned of Arron's death, which the major partly blamed on his absence from the 204th at the time.\nArron was mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed.",
