 "content": "Sayama Edosun was a Human female resident of Naboo who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSayama Edosun appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Sayama Edosun would have been on Naboo. However, Sayama Edosun is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
