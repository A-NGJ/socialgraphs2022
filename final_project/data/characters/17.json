 "content": "Clone trooper 17 served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, he and fellow trooper Three-Five fought alongside clone commando RC-1138 and two other clones in defending a barricade against Separatist B1-Series battle droids. Once the advancing droids were defeated, the surviving clones pushed through to a gun emplacement.\nDecanted on the planet Kamino by the Kaminoan species, 17 was a Human clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He served as a clone trooper in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a separatist group that attempted to secede from the Republic. In 22 BBY, 17 was deployed to the planet Geonosis, where he fought in the first battle of the Clone Wars.\nOn Geonosis, 17 and fellow trooper Three-Five greeted the clone commando RC-1138, known as \"Boss.\" Trooper 17 pointed out Boss to his companion, who responded by praising the highly-skilled commandos, remarking that they could defeat the Separatist forces alone. The trio then joined two other clone troopers in defending a barricade from Confederate B1-Series battle droids. The droids blew through a wall to avoid the barricade, killing one of the troopers. Despite the casualty, Boss, 17, 35, and the other surviving clone defeated the attacking droids, pushing them back to a Separatist gun emplacement.\nA clone of the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett, 17 stood 1.83 meters tall like all clone troopers.\nLike many clones during the opening stages of the Clone Wars, 17 wore white Phase I clone trooper armor and was armed with a DC-15S.\nTrooper 17 appeared in the video game Star Wars: Republic Commando, released by LucasArts for PC and Xbox on February 28, 2005. The character was voiced by Roger Jackson.",
