 "content": "Darth Vilus was Human or Sith pureblood descent who was a Sith Lord of the resurgent Sith Empire, who died before the Cold War, producing over three thousands volumes of writings throughout his life. He had several apprentices, the fourth of whom he killed after catching him spying. After using the ritual of Force walk, he began hearing voices of the bound Force ghosts in his head and set out to find a cure. He discovered a forbidden ritual on Voss that could heal fractured minds and he kept writings of this technique. Unfortunately, before Vilus could confirm this discovery, he went insane.\nYears later, Sith Lord Kallig, who suffered a similar problem, discovered the writings of Darth Vilus in Darth Thanaton's private library and traveled to Voss, where he successfully performed a ritual, establishing control over the ghosts in his head.",
