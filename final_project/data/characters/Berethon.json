 "content": "Berethon was a male Human Jedi Lord serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the New Sith Wars. He operated a feudal kingdom of Corellian Jedi within the war-torn regions of the Republic and stood as a bulwark against the forces of the Sith Empire.\nA male Human Force-sensitive, Berethon was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order during the Republic Dark Age. He obtained the title of Jedi Lord after assuming control of his homeworld Corellia with the intent of protecting it from invasion by the Sith Empire. When Lord Hoth, the Jedi Temple's battlemaster, rallied the banners of the Jedi Grand Council, Lord Berethon gathered his forces and joined the Army of Light in its fight against the Brotherhood of Darkness.\nLeading his forces against the armies of the Brotherhood, Lord Berethon accompanied Hoth and the other Lords to the planet Ruusan to participate in the final campaign against Dark Lord Skere Kaan and the Brotherhood. Surviving all seven major battles, Berethon and Lord Valenthyne Farfalla were the only two Lords present to survive the cataclysmic effects of the Sith-activated thought bomb. Like many other Lords, Berethon was ostracized by his Jedi brothers and sisters on Coruscant and retired with his warriors to his holdfast on Corellia where they would remain weary of Coruscant control for several generations.",
