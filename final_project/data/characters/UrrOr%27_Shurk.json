 "content": "UrrOr' Shurk was a male Tusken Raider who was active during the waning years of the Republic Classic era. In 32 BBY, he was wanted by Gardulla the Hutt for leading raids on her compound. If captured alive, he was to be fed to the Hutt's pet Krayt dragon. He was caught by Jango Fett in Tusken Canyon; although it was unspecified whether or not the bounty was for a live capture or a death, he was worth more dead  then he was alive .",
