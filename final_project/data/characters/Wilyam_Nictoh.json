After a group of CreedCon workers went missing while building a race track on Cularin, Nictoh, Ber'atta and Clatto were sent to find them. However, they were found and knocked out by a group of battle droids that worked for the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. They were later found by the Heroes of Cularin, who were sent by CreedCon to find the construction workers and the security team.",
