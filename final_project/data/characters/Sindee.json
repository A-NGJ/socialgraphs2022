 "content": "Sindee was a female member of the furred Bimm species who lived during the early years of the Galactic Empire. A shrewd businesswoman, she operated a one-woman refueling station. Around 15 BBY, the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 ended up at her station after being ejected there from a ship bound for the world of Ord Gertoth, and she became their new master. Sindee taught R2-D2 to play dejarik, but a gambling addiction she harbored saw her lose both droids to the smuggler Zevel Hortine in a game of Liar's Cut.\nSindee was first mentioned in Daniel Wallace's 2002 reference book The New Essential Guide to Characters as the nameless operator of a one-man refueling station. Rich Handley and Abel G. Pe√±a's 2013 StarWars.com blog article \"The Droids Re-Animated\" later identified Sindee by name.",
