 "content": "Ackli was a male Mon Calamari vagrant who lived on Tatooine.\nDespite Tatooine's famously arid environs, Ackli made his home in Mos Taike and became a fixture of the local cantinas. A heavy drinker, Ackli made boastful claims about his krayt dragon spottings. These claims earned him the attention of two Zabrak treasure hunters hoping to acquire valuable Krayt dragon pearls. The two treasure hunters paid Ackli to guide them towards the krayt dragons.\nWhen Dusque Mistflier and Tendau Nandon were uncovered attempting to follow the trio to attain scientific samples from the krayt dragons, Ackli aided in binding and leaving them for dead. The trio received their punishment in turn when three krayt dragons attacked and forced them into the Tatooine desert.",
