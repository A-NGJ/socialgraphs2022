 "content": "The Mad Clone of Kaikielius, as he was dubbed by HoloNet commentators, was an aberrant clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic. Like all clone troopers, he was cloned from the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett on the planet of Kamino. Unlike most aberrant clones, he went unnoticed during training and conditioning in the clone military education complex in Tipoca City, and when the Clone Wars broke out, he was part of the Republic contingent that fought in the Kaikielius campaign.\nDuring a reconnaissance mission in the campaign, the clone trooper suddenly went berserk and killed the rest of his squad. He was later found sitting docilely on an outcropping, surrounded by his batchers' bodies. Under questioning by Republic Intelligence, the Mad Clone insisted that he had been on a training mission and that his batchers had been replaced by disguised battle droids. He even congratulated his interrogators on the realism of the \"training mission\", claiming that he had almost been fooled by the droids using familiar unit codenames.",
