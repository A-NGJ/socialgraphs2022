 "content": "Dor Wieedo was a male Rodian who served as the planet Rodia's senator in the New Republic Senate in 5 ABY. He was familiar with the Orishen senator Tolwar Wartol and worked with him on several councils and caucuses. Prior to the Battle of Jakku, he and five other senators were bribed into opposing Chancellor Mon Mothma's resolution to send military forces to Jakku by the Black Sun and Red Key Raiders, two criminal organizations who wanted to prolonged the war. Wieedo agreed in return for a trade deal and received money in his electronic ledgers. The criminal conspiracy was subsequently exposed by a team led by the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus and Han Solo. Wieedo changed his vote after Sinjir posed as an adviser to the Chancellor and offered to pardon him and his colleagues if they supported the resolution.",
