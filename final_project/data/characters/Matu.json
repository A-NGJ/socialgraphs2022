 "content": "Matu was a male Rodian thug who worked for the Exchange under the command of Benok, the chief of security, and Loppak Slusk, the Exchange boss on Citadel Station. He was one of the best melee fighters in Loppak's force, wielding twin Rodian death blades with deadly precision. He was an intimidating presence and most opponents merely had to be threatened by him or by his name in order to yield. Matu, alongside Benok and Nahata, were killed in a brawl with Meetra Surik.",
