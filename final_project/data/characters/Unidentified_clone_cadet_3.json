 "content": "This clone was a cadet and participated in the Battle of Kamino. During the assault on Tipoca City, this cadet and four other members of his squad got separated from the main group of clones. The cadets encountered clone troopers Echo and Fives, who were sniping at the advancing Separatist aqua droids, and 99, who was resupplying the two troopers. The older clones then left their position to bring the group of cadets to the barracks and were later joined by Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex.\nAs the battle droids continued to advance, the cadets began to worry, with this cadet asking the older clones what they were going to do about the advancing Separatist forces. As they prepared to fight, the cadets grew nervous since they had not finished their training. However, Fives and Echo succeed in raising the morale of the young cadets, and 99 then led the group to an armory, where they grabbed extra DC-15A blaster carbines and grenades. The cadets were stationed inside the beds that retracted into the wall, and when a platoon of B1-series battle droids attacked them, they launched a surprise attack from above. The cadet survived the battle but witnessed the tragic death of 99.",
