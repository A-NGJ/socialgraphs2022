 "content": "Bozzie was an Ewok from the forest moon of Endor. She was the sister or sister-in-law of Chief Chirpa, mother of Paploo and the aunt of Princess Kneesaa and Asha. She had a matronly manner, but at times, she could be bossy and domineering.\nShe particularly had difficulties with Wicket Wystri Warrick who inadvertently antagonized her on repeated occasions. When Wicket personally saved both her and her Soul Tree from a massive forest fire, the pair reconciled. However, that new understanding did not prevent her from assuming that the young Ewok had misused village trade goods for a personal purchase upon returning from an expedition until she was reassured that Wicket had used his own trade items for it.\nBozzie was voiced by Pam Hyatt.",
