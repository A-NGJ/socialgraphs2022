 "content": "Griggen Sylo was a Human and the spouse of Tashna Sylo. The two owned a large outback farm, which had been in the Sylo family for ten generations, on the Outer Rim planet of Dantooine in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. The couple worked hard to harvest tritacale and yot beans in order to supply a larder to feed their family of seven children and to sell offworld. Between the years 30 BBY and 31 BBY, the youngest of the Sylo children, Paxi, was born. By the time of the Galactic Empire, which was formed in 19 BBY, the Sylo farm had been abandoned.\nGriggen Sylo was mentioned as one of the parents of Paxi Sylo in the latter's original Databank entry on StarWars.com, which was first posted in 2004. The entry did not specify which of the two parents was the father and which was the mother. Therefore, this article assumes no specific sex for either.",
