 "content": "Dae'o Soset was a male Human bounty hunter who was active during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Soset offered his services to the Empire, serving as part of the Dread Executioners on the moon Oricon during the phase of the conflict known as the Dread War.\nDae'o Soset was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel as part of Game Update 2.4: The Dread War. He appeared on Oricon, where he was the Basic Gear vendor for the Bounty Hunter class. Soset and the rest of the class gear vendors at Oricon, along with all other Daily Areas and high-level planets, were replaced by standardized vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; Soset was replaced by Mac Moria.",
