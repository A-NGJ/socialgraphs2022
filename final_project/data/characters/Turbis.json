 "content": "Turbis was a male Zabrak Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. He was part of Imperial strike team during the events of the Conquest of Makeb acting as an armorer for fellow Sith Inquisitors.\nTurbis first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Rakata Gear vendor for the Sith Inquisitor class. During a restructuring of the game's gear system in Game Update 2.0, he was changed to a Basic Gear vendor. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
