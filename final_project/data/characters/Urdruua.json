 "content": "Urdruua was a Hutt gangster on Nar Shaddaa generally being seen accompanied by a Gran assistant. During the Clone Wars he tried to kill Aurra Sing to get back at her for a past misdeed she had done to his family. He used several methods including poison gas, mercenaries, and smart mines. After Aurra Sing escaped each obstacle, she detonated a comm-pack which she brought to him earlier. This killed Urdruua, along with his assistant and anyone inside his palace.",
