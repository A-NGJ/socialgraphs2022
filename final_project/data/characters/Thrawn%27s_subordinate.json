 "content": "Thrawn's subordinate was an officer who served Grand Admiral Thrawn during the Galactic Civil War. He stood beside Thrawn's command chair and briefed Thrawn on several developments.\nWith a mustache, he bears some resemblance to Gilad Pellaeon, who served Thrawn after the Battle of Endor. However, it is not Pellaeon, as he did not meet Thrawn until after the Battle of Endor.\nThe game designers likely intended this to be a tribute to the The Thrawn Trilogy novels written by Timothy Zahn, which were published a few years before the release of Star Wars: TIE Fighter. Indeed, some of the story of Star Wars: TIE Fighter was modeled after Zahn's work.\nOn the other hand, the character may have actually been intended to be Pellaeon himself, making his appearance in TIE Fighter an error in light of previously established continuity.",
