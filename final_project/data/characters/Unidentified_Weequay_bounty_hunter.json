 "content": "A Weequay bounty hunter was active in 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars.\nThis bounty hunter was present along with another bounty hunter, a fellow Weequay, and two Humans, also bounty hunters, in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine. They were scrolling through a list of the latest bounties when they came across the Nightbrother Savage Opress and decided to take him, since he was worth the most credits. Asajj Ventress stepped in, however; and said that this one was for her.\nThis Weequay wore goggles and protective armor.",
