 "content": "Kandon's bodyguard was a Twi'lek member of the Black Vulkars on Taris and the bodyguard of Kandon Ark. She died when the Republic soldier Revan infiltrated the Black Vulkar Base in order to retrieve the Prototype accelerator for the Hidden Beks.\nWhen Revan and his companions arrived to the garage, where the accelerator was being held, Kandon's bodyguard requested to eliminate the intruders immediately, but Ark, noticing that the Republic soldier wasn't wearing Hidden Bek colors, offered him a chance to work for the Vulkars by killing Gadon Thek. Revan, however, refused to do so. The bodyguard then asked again if she could kill them, to which Ark approved. They and the other Vulkars present were promptly killed and Revan acquired the accelerator.\nAlternatively the player can accept Kandon Ark's offer to join the Black Vulkars and the bodyguard does not die.",
