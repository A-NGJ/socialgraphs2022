 "content": "Junter Galt was a male Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Galt led the branch of the Citizens' Militia for the Jundland Wastes settlement Espelar.\nA male Human, Junter Galt was a native of the Outer Rim planet Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. He lived in Espelar, a Republic settlement in the Jundland Wastes region south of Anchorhead. He worked as the leader of Espelar's branch of the Citizens' Militia, the regional militia.\nBut in 3643 BBY, the militia had suffered heavy losses. This sharply decreased the number of new recruits, leaving Galt with only a handful of new volunteers and no combat instructors. When a Republic-allied individual was sent by the former Jedi Galen Besk to stop Imperial saboteurs from destroying Espelar's trading posts after a sandstorm, the individual was asked by Galt and Mayor Airen to help train the new recruits.\nThe individual led Vastil and other new volunteers against the native Tusken Raider for combat training, but Galt received a distress call from Cole Darba when they returned. Darba and his men were pinned down in Manister Base, which had been overrun by a Geonosian hive. The individual led Vastil and the others into combat once again, rescuing the trapped militiamen from the base. In recognition of Vastil and his men's bravery, Galt fully inducted all of the new recruits into the militia.\nJunter Galt was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Galt gives Republic players on Tatooine the missions \"Militia Training\" and \"Militia's Trial\", as part of the Tatooine Bonus Series. He is voiced by Norm Woodel.",
