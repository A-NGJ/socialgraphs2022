 "content": "Rikael Lysannis was a Human male who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. A member of the powerful Lysannis family, Rikael was secretly a member of the Black Sun criminal syndicate.\nA Human male, Rikael was born into the Lysannis family, a powerful and well-known Coruscanti family. As he grew up, Rikael began to secretly work for the Black Sun syndicate, a criminal gang with a strong presence on his homeworld of Coruscant.\nDuring the Cold War, Rikael was arrested by the militant vigilante group known as the Justicars' Brigade, who suspected him of working for Black Sun. Captain Dragen questioned Rikael repeatedly over the course of several days in their headquarters, but Rikael would not confess until he learned that his girlfriend Daria Felton refused to corroborate his alibi. Rikael spitefully confessed to Dragen that he had been working for Black Sun ever since he was a kid, and that they would never stop the gang's rise. Having been found guilty, Rikael was executed by the Justicars.\nThe Lysannis family, having been shown the evidence and their son's own confession, refused to press charges or launch an official investigation to protect their own name. The reporter Paus, suspecting there was more to the story and looking for a way to bring down the Justicars, asked a traveling hero to recover the recording of Rikael's interrogation from one of the droids in the Justicar Tower.\nWhen the hero recovered the recording and examined it in the Justicar detention center, they found that Rikael was in fact guilty of his crimes. The hero delivered the recording to Paus, who was crestfallen at the loss of his story, but they told him to keep digging. Paus swore that he would find another way to bring down the Justicars, and destroyed the recording.\nRikael Lysannis was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears in the Coruscant mission \"Killed in Custody\", where Republic players are asked by Paus to help him recover evidence of Rikael's unlawful arrest and execution. When the player recovers the recording of his questioning from an interrogation droid in the Justicar Tower, Rikael is revealed to in fact be a member of Black Sun. The player then has the option of taking the recording as it is for light side points, or editing it to make the Justicars appear guilty for dark side points.",
