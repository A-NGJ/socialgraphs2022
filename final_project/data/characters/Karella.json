 "content": "Karella was a female Human who was part of an eight-person gang that crossed the Exchange sometime before their capture and incarceration by the Galactic Republic in the Belsavis prison. During the rioting that occurred when the Sith Empire attacked Belsavis, Karella was one of many prisoners that escaped, but she was hunted down and killed by a bounty hunter fulfilling the Exchange's contract on the gang.",
