 "content": "Vigrat Pomoner was a male Iotran from the Outer Rim planet of Iotra, where he served as a member of the Iotran Police Force. Joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic after the Imperial Military sent him and other members of Iotra's police force into an ambush, Pomoner was the gunner for the T-47 airspeeder designated Rogue Six during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, when Imperial forces attacked the Rebels there. He was killed when an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport shot down his airspeeder.\nA male of the militaristic Iotran species, Vigrat Pomoner hailed from the Outer Rim planet Iotra, and was part of the Iotran Police Force. After a unit of the Galactic Empire's military sent him and other members of the police force into an ambush because Non-huMan lives were considered expendable to them, Pomoner joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic as the Rebels tried to overthrow the Empire. He was part of the Rebel-controlled Echo Base's starfighter pilot complement that composed Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron, and Green Squadron on the barren ice planet Hoth. When Echo Base was discovered by an Imperial Viper probe droid in 3 ABY, the Imperial unit Death Squadron, led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, attacked the Rebels there.\nPomoner was one of the many Rebel pilots from the starfighter complement who were scrambled together to create Rogue Group. The only non-Human in Rogue Group, Pomoner was assigned to a T-47 airspeeder designated as Rogue Six to be its gunner, and flew with pilot Samoc Farr as Rogue Group attempted to buy time for the Rebel personnel to evacuate Echo Base aboard GR-75 medium transports. In the battle, an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport walker shot down Pomoner's T-47, killing him, though Farr survived.\nA hulking Iotran, Pomoner joined the Alliance because he was opposed to the way Imperial forces sent his police force into an ambush, as the Imperials considered non-Human lives expendable.\nVigrat Pomoner's T-47 first appeared in 1999's Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back 1, an adaption of 1980's Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Vigrat Pomoner was first identified as the T-47's gunner in The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart and released in 2012.",
