 "content": "Norcuna was a male Rutian Twi'lek Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Twi'lek, Norcuna was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. When the Clone Wars, a bloody conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, erupted across the galaxy, Master Norcuna joined the Grand Army of the Republic as a General and led clone troopers on the frontlines.\nEarly in the war, Master Norcuna was assigned to the massive Republic campaign on the world of Jabiim. Along with Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leska, and Sirrus, Master Norcuna fought long and hard on the rain-ravaged world, fighting near the city of Choal. When his forces were decimated by rebels under the leadership of Alto Stratus, Master Norcuna was left to crawl through the mud as the opposition forces closed in on him. While the Jabiimi Nationalists looked on, Stratus grabbed Master Norcuna by one of his lekku and beheaded him with his steel sword while the Jedi recited the Jedi Code. Following Norcuna's death, Master Leska took command of his surviving troopers.\nIn 2003, a blue-skinned Twi'lek Jedi was included as part of Hasbro's Jedi Knight Army multipack, however no canonical link has been established between the two characters.",
