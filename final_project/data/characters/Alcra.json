 "content": "Alcra was a middle-aged Human mercenary who worked with a civilian security force at a hyperbaride synthesis plant on the planet Marca. When Alcra's superiors, Marci and Darci Sertim, were captured by Managing Director Vost Tyne, for conspiring with the Alliance to Restore the Republic after learning that Tyne had their elder sister, Gayle, killed, Alcra and the other mercenaries fought through Imperial forces to try and rescue them. On their way, Alcra and the mercenary team encountered the Rebel agents who had been set free by the Sertim sisters as they assault on the plant.",
