 "content": "Boskirn was a male Houk bounty hunter who earned the nickname of \"Bantha\" Boskirn because of his size and lack of speed. While performing several jobs on the planet Tatooine, the homeworld of the lumbering creature that Boskirn was nicknamed after, sometime before the year 3643 BBY, Boskirn grew angry with a smuggler who mocked his nickname. Boskirn attempted to draw his blaster, but he was killed when the smuggler shot the Houk before he could fire his weapon.\nBoskirn was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the bantha in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011.",
