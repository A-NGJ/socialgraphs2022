 "content": "Wran Narcassan was a Human male who was the son of Vula Nelprin and nephew of Shalla Nelprin, who was once a member of Wraith Squadron during the Galactic Civil War. Wran took up Vyn Narcassan's–his maternal grandfather–family name as he felt his own father was not a suitable role model.\nIn 44 ABY, Wran served as a sharpshooter for Wraith Squadron in their attempt to solve the investigation on General Stavin Thaal. His unit of Wraiths, led by Sharr Latt, were integrated with Bhindi Drayson's Wraith Squadron after she died on Vandor-3 during both units' investigation into Galactic Alliance General Stavin Thaal.",
