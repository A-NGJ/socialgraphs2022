 "content": "Silaras Bey was the Human offspring of Sidoras Bey, both of which lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sidoras, who would often have a hard time remembering if Silaras was a man or a woman, tasked a spacer with rescuing Silaras after she got in trouble with some hooligans.\nSilaras Bey was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Silaras Bey spawned under the generic \"artisan\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of six possible depictions. She could appear as a Sullustan, Bith, Trandoshan, Mon Calamari, or Kajain'sa'Nikto of the male gender, or as a Human female. Because the quest dialogue identified Silaras as Sidoras' offspring, this article assumes that the Human female depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
