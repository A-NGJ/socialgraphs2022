 "content": "Olev Madak was a Duros mechanic who worked at Darknon Station during the Galactic Civil War. He repaired starships and indifferently maintained the space station. Madak had been pursued by a group of bounty hunters for unpaid gambling debts, and upon arriving at Darknon Station, his ship was demolished. Therefore, he remained on the station. Madak bore a remarkable resemblance to the Duros businessman Galladinium.\nOlev Madak's illustration was mirrored to represent Galladinium in Galladinium's Fantastic Technology.",
