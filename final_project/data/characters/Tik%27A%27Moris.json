 "content": "Tik'A'Moris was a Force-sensitive Cerean male who lived during the last days of the Republic and the reign of the Galactic Empire.\nTik'A'Moris loved the thrill of discovery and learning new facts. He was never satisfied with his current level of knowledge when the whole galaxy awaited to provide more. He was always enthusiastic about every new discovery he made and this drove him to keep searching for new and greater challenges, but he could also obsess over a single discovery to the exclusion of all else.\nTik'A'Moris appears as an introductory character for Fantasy Flight Games' Force and Destiny roleplaying game Beta.",
