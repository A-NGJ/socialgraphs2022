 "content": "Bardack was a male Klatooinian who was wanted by the Republic Security Force for suspected smuggling of narcotics in the Core Worlds.\nIn 32 BBY, he was detained in the planet Coruscant's Entertainment District by a human bounty hunter named Jango Fett, who collected the 3000 bounty for a live capture, rather than the 1500 offered for his death.\nBardack appeared in the 2002 video game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, as minor bounty for the player's character Jango Fett. Since claiming Bardack's bounty is not essential to game progression, the player can approach the bounty in several ways. The player can ignore him entirely, kill him and not claim the bounty, kill him and claim the bounty, or capture him and claim the bounty.",
