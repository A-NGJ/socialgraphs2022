 "content": "Scizzic was a male Ugnaught mechanic who worked for Talandro Starlyte on the space station Starlyte Station during the Galactic Civil War after the Battle of Yavin. A skilled mechanic, he was hired to be the primary technician for the station. However, he eventually branched out and converted a hangar into a repair shop called the Graveyard, where he performed starship repairs as well. He modified several ships including the Starbound Misfit, which he altered as a favor to Starlyte for his girlfriend, Lynnori.\nScizzic was an Ugnaught male mechanical genius who in his youth preferred fixing mining machinery to using it. Some individuals believed that he met Talandro Starlyte in Cloud City over the planet Bespin. Starlyte recognized his mechanical and technical aptitude and offered him an opportunity to repair Starlyte Station, the space facility he had recently acquired from the Galactic Empire. Scizzic lived up to Starlyte's expectations and had all of the important systems functioning in a very short time. Once the station was operational, he set up shop in the Graveyard, the nickname for the main hangar bay of Starlyte Station, where he performed starship repairs.\nThe Graveyard quickly became littered with a large variety of ships and their parts, which Scizzic would use during repairs. He insisted on doing all of his repair work personally, with some assistance from a few older repair droids. While his services were significantly more expensive than those of most other repair shops, some people believed the results were very reliable and worth the extra cost. He tinkered with ships as he repaired them and would sometimes add unrequested features in the process. Scizzic also created original improvements, such as a more efficient configuration for power couplings. When Starlyte purchased the Starbound Misfit for his girlfriend, Lynnori, Starlyte had Scizzic modify the ship. His repair operation became highly profitable for him despite the remote location of the station and the overall appearance of the Graveyard, strewn with scrap and derelict ships. In addition to his work there, he continued to perform minor repairs on Starlyte Station during the Galactic Civil War after the Battle of Yavin.\nUnlike other Ugnaughts, Scizzic had no interest in mining. Rather than make use of the machinery, he preferred to fix it. Due to his mechanical talents and love for tinkering and fixing things, Scizzic made a career out of starship repair. He was a bit shy and reserved, although he could become very excitable, especially when he worked on a ship. Despite the profitability of his operation, he continued to perform the repairs himself, as he enjoyed his work. When he would make a new discovery, his chattering would reach manic levels. Scizzic was not interested in conversation about subjects other than starship repair, as the only thing he loved more than fixing ships was talking about fixing them.\nA genius mechanic, Scizzic was very skilled in all matters of repair, including droids, computers, machinery engineering, repulsorlift vehicles, space transports, starfighters and starship weaponry as well as programming droids and computers. He also had rudimentary skill as a hover-vehicle pilot and had a keen eye for the discovery of valuable items that had been discarded as junk. He could handle a blaster if necessary, but he was more likely to hide amongst the stacks of ship hulls and spare parts than engage in a dedicated firefight.\nScizzic carried around a set of tools, which at any given time might include hydrospanners, a plasma welder, a diagnostic scanner, a datapad, a laser cutter, and various repair kits. He also had a concealed hold-out blaster.\nScizzic was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. The book included illustrations of Scizzic that were created by Joe Corroney.",
