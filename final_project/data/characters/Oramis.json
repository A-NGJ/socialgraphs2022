 "content": "Oramis was a female Human member of the Scions of Zakuul living during the war against Zakuul. After head Scion Heskal was killed by Arcann during the Battle of Asylum, the remaining Scions fled wrath of his sister Vaylin, who pursued them across known space. After Vaylin was killed by the Alliance Commander, who claimed the Eternal Throne and proclaimed the Eternal Alliance, the Scions traveled to the recently discovered worlds of Iokath, where during the battle for Iokath the Commander approached the Scions. Oramis explaied why they were unable to assist in the revolt and explained that the recent events have awakened Tyth, one of the Old Gods of Zakuul, who threatened to cause untold havoc once again. Oramis foretold that the Commander would confront the Gods and subdue them, being judged of being worthy to take possession of the droid shells.\nOramis appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the \"Facing the Machines of War\" mission on Iokath.",
