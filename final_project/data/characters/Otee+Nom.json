 "content": "Otee Nom was a female Rodian Force Adept who lived in the Cularin system around 31 BBY. She helped train other Force adepts as organized by Taleah Novran and Lony Hertz. Nom found inner peace from her Force abilities, and so was never flustered by the odd twists that occurred in life. She preferred to analyze situations before acting in the most practical and efficient manner. The Rodian was honest, however, she sought to minimize hurt even when stating her mind.\nNom was present at the SoroSuub Anniversary celebration in 31 BBY.",
