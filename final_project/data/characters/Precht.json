 "content": "Precht was a fair-skinned Human male trooper recruit in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War fought between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire. At some point following the Alliance's formation, Precht had recently become a member, and was a rookie Rebel trooper aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV. He excelled in planetside security missions while trying to impress the vessel's Captain, Raymus Antilles, and overall hoped to make a good impression with both the captain and his crew. Precht wore the standard Alliance Fleet trooper uniform and was armed with a DH-17 blaster pistol.\nPrecht was first featured on a card for the Premiere edition of Decipher, Inc.'s 2001 Jedi Knights Trading Card Game.",
