 "content": "Var Narek was a Human male from the Outer Rim planet of Ord Radama. His father's anger toward the planet's governor, Ellor Orgraal, rubbed off on him, and extended to the Galactic Empire as a whole.\nNarek eventually joined the Rebel Alliance forces at the Arda I Rebel base, where he became a field assistant to Setenna Hase, one of the founders of the Arda cell. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant. However, after his brother Aleos and his family were killed during a battle between Rebel and Imperial forces, Narek decided that he had to end Galactic Civil War, even if that meant an Imperial victory.\nNarek contacted a member of the Imperial Intelligence service and provided him with the location of the Arda base. When Imperial forces drove the rebels off of Arda I, Narek traveled with the survivors to Jagomir, where his actions were discovered. Before he could be apprehended, though, Narek was able to escape, taking Hase prisoner. He then fled to his homeworld.",
