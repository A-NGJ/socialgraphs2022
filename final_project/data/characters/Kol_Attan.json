 "content": "Kol Attan was a male Yevetha who served as the proctor of defense for the spawnworld.\nHe was blamed for the destruction of the corvette Beauty of Yevetha by New Republic X-wing pilot Rone Taggar. Nil Spaar declared him to-mara, and refused him an honourable execution. Instead, he was told to seek a dishonourable death at the hands of his own darna.\nHe was replaced as proctor of defense by Tho Voota.",
