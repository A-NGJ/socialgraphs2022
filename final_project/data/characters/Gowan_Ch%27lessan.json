 "content": "Gowan Ch'lessan was a Human male slicer and a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nA native of Chandrila, he was inspired to join the Alliance while listening to speeches made by Mon Mothma. He became the slicer on Koris Haslam's commando team and participated in several missions, including the rescue of Gebnerret Vibrion from the Imperial prison on Selnesh. Gowan entered the prison disguised as a stormtrooper, and was responsible for slicing into the main computer and disabling the prison's lone tractor beam, allowing the team's transport to escape with Vibrion. Following the raid, he comforted Dr. Aurin Leith, who was upset over having to kill a stormtrooper during the mission, which broke her doctor's oath.",
