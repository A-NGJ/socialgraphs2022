 "content": "Parnath was a Carosite cyberneticist who trained on Carosi XII; however, he was exiled from the planet for his unethical practices. Most repulsive to the Carosites was his wholesale pursuit of credits. Parnath then moved to the Vergesso Asteroids where he would perform any cybernetic enhancements requested of him, provided the payment was good.",
