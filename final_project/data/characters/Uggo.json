He possessed little intellect and couldn't speak Basic very well, making him easily susceptible to scams.\nUggo appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
