 "content": "Scott was a Human sergeant and commando in the Rebel Alliance. Sergeant Scott fought and died in the Battle of Hoth alongside Lieutenant Downey. The two of them watched over one of several entrances into Echo Base.\nDuring 3 ABY, Sergeant Scott watched over one of several entrances into Echo Base. Scott was a Rebel commando, and guarded the entrance into Echo Base alongside another Rebel commando, named Lieutenant Downey. When guarding the base, Scott was equipped with a cold weather headgear, gloves, and backpack. When the Galactic Empire infiltrated Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth, Scott and Downey were killed by Imperial forces.\nScott was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. He was introduced to the game during Chapter 11 of November 20, 2008. This Chapter introduced the Battle of Echo Base heroic encounter.\nPlayers of the Imperial faction who partook in this heroic encounter were required to infiltrate Echo Base alongside Imperial snowtroopers. When players entered the base, Sergeant Scott and Lieutenant Downey could be seen watching over the entrance from an elevated observation post. If players did not kill either Scott or Downey, the snowtrooper NPC's would do so themselves, in the process of taking over the base. Therefore, their deaths are considered canon. In the game, Scott was referred to as Sgt. Scott, and examining the NPC revealed Scott to be a Rebel commando.\nScott Downey was an artist who worked on the Battle of Echo Base heroic encounter for Sony Online Entertainment. However, no relation between him and the characters Scott and Downey has been mentioned.",
