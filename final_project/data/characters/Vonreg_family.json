 "content": "The Vonreg family, also known as the Vonregs were an aristocratic family whose ancestors were rumored to have hailed from Atrisia. The Vonreg family crest was worn proudly by its scions and allies, where crest itself recalls the family's rumored ancestral roots on Atrisia. They dedicated themselves to the Galactic Empire's war effort, which they were rewarded for, and the members of the family serving in the Imperial Starfighter Corps had the right to wear a special flight helmet with a bronze finish. The Titan Squadron pilot Havina Vonreg was a member of the family. The family shared their name with Major Baron Elrik Vonreg, a pilot of the First Order.",
