 "content": "Craw was a male Targonnian who served as the self-styled Dictator-Forever of Targonn during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was extremely self-absorbed and cared little for the troubles of his people, creating a 99 percent tax, and forcing child labor. The chief enforcer of his will was Captain Steggus. Craw sought the secret of savorium which he planned to utilize to stop the peasants under his rule from complaining about the poor conditions in which they lived. However, he was thwarted by the forces of Zorneth.",
