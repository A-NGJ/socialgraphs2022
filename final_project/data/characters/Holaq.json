 "content": "Holaq was a Weequay who had worked with the Hidden Hand criminal syndicate during the Imperial Era. At some point prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Holaq chatted with the Aqualish Uro while on the world Fikari. While hunting down the syndicate, the Sith Lord Darth Vader located Holaq and Uro on Fikari, killing both of them after interrogating the Weequay regarding information on the Hidden Hand.\nHolaq was a Weequay who worked with the Hidden Hand criminal syndicate sometime prior to the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. While in the Lower Bay Docks located in the Outer Rim world Fikari, Holaq chatted with the Aqualish Uro, exclaiming that the Sith Lord Darth Vader had attacked a number of clans and left no survivors. Uro stated that while it was the cost of working for the Hidden Hand, it came with the benefit of remaining anonymous to the syndicate. Holaq replied the syndicate's days were limited as Vader was actively hunting the Hidden Hand down.\nWhile conversing with the Aqualish, Vader, who was on a mission to hunt down the Hidden Hand, arrived at the docks and began slaughtering the guards, unbeknownst to both Uro and Holaq. Immediately afterwards, Uro was suddenly pulled back and killed. Noticing the Aqualish's disappearance, Holaq pulled out his blaster pistol and was immediately alerted to Vader's presence when the Sith Lord crushed the blaster using his Force powers. Holaq was then questioned about the Hidden Hand's location, and pleaded with the Sith Lord, claiming that the syndicate never revealed themselves and only paid credits to buy their loyalty. Vader, unsatisfied with the Weequay's response, caused an explosion using the Force, which engulfed and killed Holaq.\nHolaq was a Weequay with orange skin and brown hair. After hearing the stories of Darth Vader, Holaq began to fear the Sith Lord, believing that the Hidden Hand's days were limited as the Weequay was certain Vader would find the syndicate eventually.\nHolaq wore a brown cape that covered his left shoulder over a brown outfit, with a pauldron over his right shoulder. The Weequay had a blaster pistol holstered on his right hip and wore brown gloves and boots.\nHolaq appeared in the first issue of the 2019 comic book series Star Wars: Target Vader, written by Robbie Thompson, illustrated by Marc Laming and Cris Bolson, and published by Marvel Comics on July 3, 2019.",
