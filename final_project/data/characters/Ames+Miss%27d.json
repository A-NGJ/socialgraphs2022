 "content": "Ames Miss'd was a Human male Ragtag criminal who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he lived in Coronet City and used to work with two henchmen, Anita B'ath and Box O'Rox. In 1 ABY, Ames Miss'd and his associates used to harass new recruits of the rival Meatlump gang. Angered by this situation, a food supply clerk of the Meatlumps tasked a spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps to teach the Ragtags a lesson. The spacer therefore met Miss'd outside Coronet. The former attempted to intimidate the Ragtag but Miss'd was not scared and ordered Anita and Box to attack the spacer. Eventually, the spacer managed to kill them both. Unable to defend himself, Ames Miss'd surrendered and accepted to live the Meatlumps alone.\nAmes Miss'd appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ames Miss'd was added to the game as part of the \"Meatlumps Theme Park\", introduced with \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008.",
