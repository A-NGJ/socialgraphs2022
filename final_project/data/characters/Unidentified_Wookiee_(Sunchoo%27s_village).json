 "content": "A shaggy-haired individual was a Wookiee who lived in a village on the Mid Rim planet of Kashyyyk, and was a member of the village's tribe. At some point in 22 BBY, several residents of the village were kidnapped by the bounty hunter Crovan Dane. In 22 BBY, Jaylen Kos, a youngling, and Jedi Master Bant Eerin's Padawan rescued the kidnapped inhabitants and returned them to their village. Upon the resident's return, the village hosted a celebration to honor the occasion, and the Wookiee participated in the festivities. During the party, the Wookiee offered to accept the Jedi into the village's tribe.\nThis Wookiee appeared, unidentified, in The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Way of the Jedi, a 2008 book by Jake Forbes. Since it is a Decide Your Destiny book, there are several different outcomes for the scenarios featured within. However, this Wookiee only appears in one of those strands, so this article details that one.",
