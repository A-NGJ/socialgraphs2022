 "content": "Phis Benlip was a male Human who worked for the Hutt Riboga during the time of the Clone Wars.\nFollowing Riboga's return to the Cularin system, he sent Benlip and a group of thugs to the moon Dorumaa, to extort money from businesses on the world. Benlip worked his way through various resorts on the world and eventually came to Greentree Pointe, where he extorted money from hotels and other tourist facilities. However, while Benlip and his men were attempting extract money from an amusement park owner, they were confronted by the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system. Benlip and his thugs fled the scene by jumping into cars on the Meteor Strike!! rollercoaster ride, and heroes pursued them.",
