 "content": "A Mizi male served as the captain of a starship that hauled cargo during the time of the High Republic Era. The Mizi captain and his crew were stranded when hyperspace routes were closed in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, and took refuge aboard an abandoned space station along with numerous other vessels that had been stranded in the same star system. The Mizi, like several of the other parties, intended to loot the station, but the looting was eventually called off by the Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus. Several days into their stay on the station, the Mizi still refused to cooperate, as did several other groups. Leox Gyasi, captain of the Vessel, convinced the parties to share their resources by reminding them of their luck in surviving the disaster; the Mizi captain admitted that his starship had been carrying repair parts, which he offered to those who required them. Limited hyperspace travel was eventually permitted, and the Mizi departed the station.",
