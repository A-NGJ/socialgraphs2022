 "content": "A Human male was a cousin of Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan. During the Clone Wars, he served as a tactical officer aboard the Galactic Republic naval ship Bespin Dancer. In 21 BBY, the Human was killed when the Dancer was destroyed while combating Separatist forces over the planet Falleen.\nA Human male was the cousin of Queen Breha Organa, the incumbent monarch of the planet Alderaan during the Clone Wars. Although only cousins, the two had a very good relationship, more like that of brother and sister. The Queen's cousin served the Republic during the Clone Wars and was a tactical officer aboard the Republic Navy starship Bespin Dancer. In 22 BBY, the Bespin Dancer engaged Separatist forces over the planet Falleen. During the battle, all Republic ships in the engagement were destroyed, including the Bespin Dancer. The destruction of the warship killed Organa's cousin, who was aboard the ship at the time. On the planet Coruscant, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi affirmed the destruction of the Bespin Dancer and the death of Organa's cousin when he spoke to Senator Bail Prestor Organa, the Queen's husband. Bail Organa went on to tell his wife about the demise of her cousin, although Kenobi advised him against it, as it was in violation of protocol.\nThe Human and Breha Organa had a special relationship between them like brother and sister, despite only being cousins. Bail Organa thought that his wife should know about the death of her cousin from him and not from a simple HoloNet News message, even going so far as arguing with Obi-Wan Kenobi about sending a transmission. During the Clone Wars, the individual served in the Republic Navy.\nThe individual was first mentioned in The Clone Wars: Wild Space, a novel written by Karen Miller and published in 2008.",
