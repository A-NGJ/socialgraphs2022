There he worked with the protocol droid 05-D6, and greeted arrivals to the station who planned on traveling down to Belsavis, confiscating their equipment before they did so. During the Galactic War against the Sith Empire, he greeted one individuals who had recently gained clearance to land and informed them that he wouldn't be confiscating their equipment as Belsavis's warden Playt wanted them down on the surface immediately.",
