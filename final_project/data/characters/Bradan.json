 "content": "Lieutenant Bradan was an officer of Warlord Zsinj.\nBradan was a combat specialist who was originally assigned the point position of the intrusion team assigned to capture the Razor's Kiss. Her job, however, was given to Shalla Nelprin in the guise of Qatya Nassin, as the other woman was smaller and seemed less intimidating.\nBradan accompanied the rest of the team to the bridge of the Razor's Kiss and almost caught \"Qatya\" downloading a tracking program into the ship's main computer, but was fooled by the other's nonchalance. After authorizing the smaller woman to attack a \"security detail,\" Bradan stayed in the bridge and was killed in the attacks on the ship.",
