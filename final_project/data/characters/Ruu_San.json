 "content": "Ruu San was a beautiful and deadly Human female who was a member of the Galactic Empire's Special Operations. As part of the organization, her role entailed protecting the secrecy of Operation Dark Trooper at all costs around the time of the destruction of the Empire's first Death Star at the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. As part of her mission, she faced the Rebel agent Kyle Katarn who was investigating the project. San was cunning and eminently capable in her role.\nRuu San was meant to appear in the 1995 computer game Star Wars: Dark Forces, and so was briefly described as an antagonist and equal of Kyle Katarn in the article \"Revving Up the 'Jedi Engine'\" in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 1, published on October 1, 1994. However, she did not appear in the final release of the game.\nThe name \"Ruusan\" later appeared as a planet in the game's sequel Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, released in 1997.",
