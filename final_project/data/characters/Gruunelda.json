 "content": "Gruunelda was a female Trandoshan, who lived on Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nGruunelda was a sergeant in the Office of Peace and Security, Cularin's law enforcement agency. She liked to wear lipstick and on occasion, she would purchase bootleg Trandoshan music from S\u0026N Music. In her spare time, she also liked to visit the bar Lover's Kiss, in Hedrett.\nWhen Senator Lavina Wren and Jarid DeBell announced that they were going to get married, the Heroes of Cularin were sent to investigate a plot to stop the wedding. They asked Gruunelda a few questions about the plot.",
