 "content": "Toomata Wree, also know as Tooms, was a male Abednedo that was in the employment of Surat Nuat on the planet Akiva. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, Wree aided his fellow henchmen Makarial Gravin and Herf in the attempted retrieval of goods stolen by Temmin Wexley from Surat's downed transport ship. The three gangsters confronted Temmin at his junkshop but were knocked out by the boy's modified B1-series battle droid Mister Bones.\nThe male Abednedo gangster Toomata Wree worked for the Sullustan crime lord Surat Nuat on the planet Akiva during the Age of the Empire. He also had a girlfriend named Looda. Following the Battle of Endor, Tooms and two associates, the Koorivar Makarial Gravin and the Ithorian Herf, were dispatched by Surat to \"settle scores\" with a local human junk dealer named Temmin Wexley. Wexley had stolen a valuable shipment of data cubes from a wrecked transport that had crashed on Trabzon Road in Myrra, Akiva's capital city.\nUpon entering the store, Tooms and his companions confronted the boy and demanded that he pay restitution. When Makarial demanded that the boy give up his shop, Temmin unleashed his modified B1-series battle droid Mister Bones on the gangsters. During the fight, Tooms tried to draw his blaster but the battle droid slammed Herf straight into him. Bones then knocked the two out by pounding their heads together. Their leader Makarial was incapacitated by Temmin's modified interrogator droid. Temmin then ordered Mister Bones to dump the unconscious criminals into the Kora Biedies. However, the criminals managed to break free and deactivate the battle droid. Surat and his other henchmen then set a trap for Temmin in his junkshop.\nAfter Temmin's recapture, Tooms remained in the junkshop while the others left. He attempted to salvage something for his girlfriend Looda, who was unhappy with his association with Surat. The Abednedo the accidentally opened up a hidden passageway in the basement of the shop while trying to steal a translator droid's head. Before he could enter, Temmin's mother Norra Wexley entered the room and shot Tooms in the stomach and then again to disarm him. She then thrust her pistol under his chin and demanded that Tooms tell her where her son was.\nToomata Wree was a gangster who associated with other criminals and used foul language. He was prepared to used violence when negotiations did not work. While he was a fighter, he was no match for the modified B1 battle droid Mister Bones. After witnessing his Rodian associate being gunned down by Norra Wexley, Toom cooperated with the woman, who demanded to know where her son Temmin was.\nToomata also had romantic feelings for his girlfriend Looda and respected her enough to salvage loot for her. She disagreed with his involvement in Surat Nuat's criminal gang.\nToomata Wree first appeared in Chuck Wendig's 2015 novel Aftermath, which was part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens series. He is erroneously described as a Rodian twice in the novel; however, as he is most frequently referred to as being an Abednedo this article assumes that this is his correct species.",
