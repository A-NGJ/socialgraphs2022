 "content": "Faa-Char was a Mon Calamari individual that served as the commander of the Mon Cals. Although the Alliance to Restore the Republic had a good relationship with the Mon Cals, the Rebel Alliance was not yet able to convince the bulk of the Mon Cals to join the fight against the Galactic Empire.\nDue to the actions of Raddus and his Mon Cal refugees, the Empire believed that the entire Mon Calamari species was treasonous. Faa-Char and the Mon Cals were included in a report that was in The Rebel Files that would be uncovered years later by the Resistance. When reviewing the files, Admiral Gial Ackbar left a note on Faa-Char.",
