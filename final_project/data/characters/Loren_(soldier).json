 "content": "Sergeant Loren was a Human male soldier who served the resurgent Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nIn 3642 BBY, he was stationed in Dorn Base on the planet Hoth where he met with the Sith Lord Kallig, who wrongfully thought was under Darth Thanaton's orders. Kallig asked the sergeant about finding the ship Starrunner but the best the Imperial soldier could offer was to assign Recovery teams, but it still could take months until finding the lost starship. Under the Sith Lord's pressure Loren requested that if things were to be to be rushed, they would need help convincing one of the best recovery teams, which was being lead by a disobedient officer, who spent their time tracking an ancient Sith Temple.",
