 "content": "Sula Autem was a female Human who was the wife of Sagoro and the mother of Reymet and Lissa.\nBoth Sula and her husband were descended from generations of Senate Guards, and lived with their children in an apartment on the planet Coruscant. When Sagoro went to work as a Guard for the Galactic Senate of the Republic, she spent much of her time at home with their children.\nAfter the events of Sagoro's case with Simon Greyshade, and her husband's aggression towards their son as a result of his lack of interest in Sagoro's work, Sula separated from Sagoro and moved with their children to Corellia.\nSula eventually reunited with him several weeks after the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire under the rule of Emperor Palpatine.",
