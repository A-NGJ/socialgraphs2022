 "content": "Herf was a Nikto slave of the Infinite Empire. A member of the Esral'sa'Nikto subspieces, Herf had green-grey skin and gray eyes. Like all Force-sensitive slaves of the Infinite Empire, Herf was named after a letter in the Aurebesh alphabet—namely, the letter Herf—and had white tattoos of the letter on the slave's forehead and limbs. Herf was brood mates with fellow slaves Xesh and Trill, and all three were among those who were used to power the machines of the Rakata species that ruled the Infinite Empire.\nHerf was first shown in a flashback scene from Xesh's past in Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1, the first issue in the The Prisoner of Bogan story arc of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi comic book series, though the Nikto's gender was not identified.",
