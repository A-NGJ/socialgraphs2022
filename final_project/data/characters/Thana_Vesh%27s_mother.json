 "content": "A female Human was the mother of Thana Vesh. A member of the Imperial Military of the Sith Empire like her husband, the woman raised her daughter Thana in wealth and privilege on the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas. However, Thana had a volatile temper and took pleasure in destroying her surroundings and tormenting her parents; when she discovered she was Force-sensitive, Thana experimented on her parents' bodyguards. After the eighth fatality, sometime after 3681 BBY, Thana's parents tried to suppress her power. However, Thana lashed out, killing her parents and causing an entire block of Kaas City to burn to the ground.\nThana Vesh's mother was first mentioned in Thana's Codex entry in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
