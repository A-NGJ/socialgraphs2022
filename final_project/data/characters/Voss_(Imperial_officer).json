 "content": "Major Voss was a Human male Imperial officer who commanded a Star Destroyer during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, Voss's Star Destroyer was part of the Admiral Mils Giel's \"secret armada\" tasked with transporting a rare and unique creature known as the teezl to the Imperial capital. En route, however, it was attacked by a small Rebel squadron disguised in TIE fighters. Taken by surprise, Voss ordered his crew to fire indiscriminately at their surroundings, wreaking havoc throughout the armada.",
