 "content": "\"Nana\" was the nickname of a Chiss female who was the wife of Syndic Zistalmu of the Chiss Ascendancy nation's Irizi family. She was a former caregiver for sky-walkers, young Chiss girls who had abilities which helped them navigate the Unknown Regions, spending two years as a caregiver prior to marrying Zistalmu. She temporarily served as a caregiver again to sky-walker Che'ri on a mission to the Vak Combine home planet of Primea.\nNana was the name assumed by a Chiss female who was married to Syndic Irizi'stal'mustro \"Zistalmu\" of the Chiss Ascendancy nation's Irizi family, and former caregiver to sky-walkers, young Chiss girls who had Third Sight, abilities which helped them navigate the Unknown Regions. Around 19 BBY, when Che'ri—the temporary sky-walker of the Nightdragon man-of-war Vigilant warship—required a caregiver, Zistalmu suggested his wife, allowing himself to gain presence aboard the Vigilant for a mission to collect Senior Captain Thrawn from the Unknown Regions planet of Primea, where he had been undercover on a mission.\nThe Vigilant's captain, Admiral Ar'alani, originally did not want Nana aboard her ship as it would bring Zistalmu aboard as well, but agreed to it at the behest of Supreme General Ba'kif. The caregiver insisted all aboard the ship refer to her as \"Nana\", much to Ar'alani's annoyance. When Ar'alani asked Che'ri if she was ready to jump to hyperspace, Nana replied in the affirmative on the girl's behalf, causing the admiral to ask her directly, wanting an answer from Che'ri.\n\"Nana\" appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, the first volume of the The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
