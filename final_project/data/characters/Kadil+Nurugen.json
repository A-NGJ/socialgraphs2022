 "content": "Kadil Nurugen was a Human male who was present on Naboo during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKadil Nurugen appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Kadil Nurugen would have been on Naboo. However, Nurugen is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
