 "content": "Ni-Cada was a male Cerean Force-sensitive Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Around 67 BBY, he and his Padawan, Lo Bukk, were dispatched by the Order to the planet Abraxin to investigate the continued slaughter of Marsh haunts, which were perpetrated by the Force-sensitive Nautolan Naat Lare. On the planet, the Jedi unknowingly crossed paths with the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis who was also seeking Lare. Plagueis managed to make contact with Lare and manipulate him into attacking Ni-Cada and his Padawan as proof of Lare's worthiness to join the Sith. After a short skirmish, Lare was killed by Ni-Cada.\nA male Force-sensitive Cerean Jedi Master, Ni-Cada served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic forty-five years before the onset of the Clone Wars, a major galactic conflict fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He and his Padawan, Lo Bukk, a male Zabrak, were dispatched by the Order to the planet Abraxin, a swampy world in the Tion Cluster, to investigate the continued slaughter of the non-sentient Marsh haunts, swamp-dwelling gray and green skinned creatures. The Marsh haunt killings were perpetrated by the Force-sensitive male Nautolan Naat Lare. Lare had been selected by Darth Venamis, a prospective Bith Sith Lord of the lineage of Darth Bane, as a potential Sith apprentice.\nDuring their stay on the swamp world, the Jedi were bargaining with a member of the Barabel species, who were cold-blooded reptilians from the planet Barab I, for a water skimmer when the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis passed by under disguise. Both Ni-Cada and Lo Bukk felt Plagueis' presence, though neither of them identified him as a Sith, a sect of Force-sensitives who utilized the dark side of the Force. After, the Jedi unknowingly crossed paths again with Darth Plagueis while bearing flagons of liquid from an eatery, as they sat at a table and talked to the Muun about the recent events of Marsh haunt slaughtering. Although it was unknown to Ni-Cada and his Padawan, the Muun was also secretly seeking Lare. Plagueis later managed to make contact with Lare and manipulate him into attacking Ni-Cada and his Padawan as proof of Lare's worthiness to become a Sith. Ni-Cada killed Lare after a short skirmish fought near the water, where the Jedi tracked Lare to with the skimmer.\nNi-Cada had a more reserved attitude, as he withheld the reason of his visit to Abraxin from Plagueis, though Lo Bukk told the Muun anyway. Ni-Cada was tall and rangy. When the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis passed by under disguise, both Ni-Cada and Lo Bukk felt Plagueis' presence, though neither of them identified him as a Sith, a sect of Force-sensitives who utilized the dark side of the Force.\nNi-Cada first and currently only appearance to date was in the 2012 novel Darth Plagueis, written by James Luceno. The novel tells the backstory of Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Plagueis.",
