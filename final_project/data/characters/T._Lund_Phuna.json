 "content": "T. Lund Phuna was the local Constable on the mining asteroid Oseon 2795, appointed by the Administrator Senior of the Oseon system during the Imperial Period. A squat, curly-haired Human male iven to chain-smoking cigarettes, Phuna was secretly in the employ of Governor Duttes Mer of the nearby Rafa system and his associate, Sorcerer of Tund Rokur Gepta, who plotted to rope in a traveler stopping in the Oseon to help them acquire an ancient Sharu artifact called the Mindharp. Phuna was known to spend his time playing sabaccâ€”on one occasion in 3 BBY, Phuna played a game with visiting smuggler Lando Calrissian, whom Mer and Gepta had identified as a likely target. After being cleaned out for over a thousand credits, Phuna planted a cheater on Calrissian and attempted to arrest the man. Local miners Vett Fori and Arun Feb caught Phuna in the act and refused to let it stand, and Fori knocked Phuna out cold to allow Calrissian to escape.",
