 "content": "Daan was a female Human naval Lieutenant who served in the Confederate Navy during the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, Daan was part of the crew of the Starcrusher. During the infiltration of the mock-Starcrusher, Daan was left behind by her crew on board the trap and made to cooperate with the Jedi in order to survive.\nShe helped the knights locate space suits and determine the coordinates to the reactor core on the real battleship. While the rest of the crew were killed when the Starcrusher plunged into a star, Daan survived alongside the Jedi.",
