 "content": "Tasia was a Cathar female marauder in the Nihil organization. She served as a Storm in the Tempest of Lourna Dee. After Dee's starship, the Lourna Dee, was boarded by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Battle of Galov, Tasia was among the Nihil that were taken prisoner; the captured included Dee herself, though their captors were unaware of her identity. After both Tasia and Dee were assigned to the correctional ship Restitution, Tasia had Dee serve her under threat of revealing her true identity.\nTasia's fur was red, the color of blood. Ola Hest's henchwoman Parr noted that blood would not show on Tasia's red fur.\nTasia was voiced by January LaVoy in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott.",
