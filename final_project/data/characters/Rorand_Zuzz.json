 "content": "Rorand Zuzz was a male Ugnaught who was a tech specialist skilled in working with medical equipment.\nIn 20 BBY, he was stationed on Drongar during the Clone Wars and survived the attack of the Separatist forces made against Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7. Afterward, he would take up his business in a new location. When Republic forces stationed on the planet discovered that the Bota that grew there no longer had any use, Rorand and the entire Republic operation, along with the Separatists, evacuated Drongar.",
