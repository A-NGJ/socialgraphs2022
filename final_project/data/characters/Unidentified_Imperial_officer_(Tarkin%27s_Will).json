 "content": "An human individual served as an Imperial officer aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will during the Galactic Civil War. Prior to the battle at Elessia, Lieutenant Gorr asked the officer why Commander Ellian Zahra, leader of Hunter Fleet, wasn't enthusiastic about engaging the Seventh Division rather than the Fourth Division. The officer replied that the Fourth had Princess Leia Organa, which was Zahra's prize. The officer continued the conversation, ending that for Zahra it was personal regarding the princess. Like all others aboard Tarkin's Will, the officer lost someone during the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star. The officer had a black military uniform with the Imperial crest on the upper sleeves and a cap. The officer had a rank insignia plaque with six red tiles, denoting their military rank.",
