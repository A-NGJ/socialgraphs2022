 "content": "Leo Bellsfar was a Human male who was the King of the Phosphura Belt Pirates during the Galactic Civil War. He had a mustache, baggy eyes and his thin hair was combed back. He was quite anonymous, preferring to keep out of sight and directing most of the pirates' activities through his buccaneers. He spent much of his time doing business with the Geelan, and rumor had it that he was also settling a deal with the Rebellion.\nHe resided in the Rusted Cutlass II aboard the Zirtran's Anchor space station.",
