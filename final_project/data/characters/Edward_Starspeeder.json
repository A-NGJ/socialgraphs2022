 "content": "Edward Starspeeder, also known as Krio Vin, was a Sith Lord and the father of Victor and Christina Starspeeder.\nKrio Vin, at his core, seemed to be little  more than a power-hungry, ego maniacal, narcissistic and bitter lord of the Sith, and his goals were solely to acquire absolute power and share it with his family. Truly arrogant, he believed himself a broader thinker than his ex-wife, who he claimed never understood what the Dark side of the Force had to offer, and to be far stronger than Victor and his 'little pals'. He did not, however, appear to be of a particularly sophisticated mind, as he was easily deceived by his own daughter and his means of turning people to the Dark side seemed to be making abrasive demands and reaching for his lightsaber if they said no.\nKrio Vin was a competent lightsaber duelist, capable of easily parrying three Jedi initiates' attacks simultaneously  and intercepting a powerful blow from Mr. Zefyr. He was adept at telekinesis, using it to restrain and levitate his son. He was also a skilled pilot.\nKrio Vin is the overarching antagonist of the Victor Starspeeder trilogy",
