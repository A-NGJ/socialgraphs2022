 "content": "A Rodian was a member of a criminal group led by Boss Ororab during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the Rodian accompanied other members of the group aboard a starship to the planet Jekara. Sometime after arriving, the rebel pilot and Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker flew his T-65B X-wing starfighter close to the group's ship whilst baiting the Sith Lord Darth Vader into a starfighter chase. The Rodian noticed the X-wing and pointed it out to the ship's captain, before they added that Ororab had been looking for that particular model and finally told the captain it was within range of their magna-harpoons. In response, the captain ordered the harpoons be fired at Skywalker's ship, which they successfully did and as the group towed Skywalker and his vessel into their ship, the pilot was saved by Vader who fired on the group's ship, which allowed Skywalker to escape.",
