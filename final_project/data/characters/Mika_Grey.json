 "content": "Mika Grey was a human female archaeologist and treasure hunter who, during the war between the First Order and the Resistance, searched for Sith artifacts to prevent people such as the First Order from acquiring them. While searching for one such artifact on Ashas Ree, Grey encountered Kazuda Xiono, who had visited the planet in search of supplies for the Colossus.\nMika Grey was an archaeologist and treasure hunter who dedicated her life to searching for Sith artifacts in order to prevent the First Order from acquiring them. Mika was known to have evaded First Order Raiders on Vargos 9.\nFollowing the Hosnian Cataclysm, Mika Grey traveled to the remote forest planet of Ashas Ree. She visited a trading outpost that hosted a Temple of the Force that was built on top of an ancient Sith temple. Her excavation of the Sith temple terrified the locals, who fled into the forests. While attempting to retrieve a Sith relic from the temple, she became trapped in an underground chamber.\nMika was trapped in the chamber for two days until her cries were heard by Eila, a Force-sensitive human girl who was visiting the temple with her brother Kel, the Resistance spy and pilot Kazuda Xiono, and the BB-series astromech droid CB-23. Eila convinced the others to explore the Sith temple but the group became separated. Kaz and CB-23 managed to reach the chamber above the underground chamber where Mika was trapped. Disoriented by an electric shock caused by a temple booby trap, Kaz touched a triangular symbol despite Mika's warnings and fell into the chamber.\nMika was initially suspicious of Kaz. After ascertaining that he was not from the First Order, Mika explained that she had been excavating the Sith temple but had become trapped inside. She also explained the Jedi practice of building their temples over Sith temples as part of a process of purification. Despite her warnings, Kaz accidentally triggered a booby-trap device which activated a giant grinding machine below them.\nUsing his comlink, Kaz managed to contact Eila, Kel, and CB-23 for help. With the guidance of Mika, Kel and Eila managed to press several buttons which deactivated the grinder, saving her and Kaz from death. While CB-23 let down a grappling cable for Kaz, Mika managed to leap out of the pit into the upper chamber. She managed to retrieve the Sith relic she had been searching for. The group then escaped the crumbling temple after Kaz accidentally disabled a self-destruct mechanism.\nReaching the surface at night, Mika and her companions discovered that First Order Raiders led by Raith had arrived and captured Xiono's companions Torra Doza, Freya Fenris, and their astromech droids. Mika proposed returning to their ship but was forced to change her plan after the First Order destroyed her ship. Kaz then came up with a plan which involved him, Kel and Eila distracting the First Order soldiers while she rescued Kaz's companions.\nHowever, Kaz, Kel, Eila, and CB-23 were quickly captured. Before Raith could deal with them, Mika went to the top of the temple and taunted them about the Sith relic. When Raith offered to trade the Sith relic for the lives of her companions, Mika activated the Sith relic and threw it to the ground. She managed to warn Kaz and the others to escape before the relic exploded, incinerating the First Order Raiders.\nAfter eliminating the First Order threat, Mika accepted an invitation from Kaz and Eila to join them aboard the Colossus, a refueling platform that was fleeing the First Order. During the journey home, Mika befriended Eila, who asked her about the Force. Mika told Eila that the Force did not belong to one person but was something inside everyone. Her words caused Kaz to reconsider his skepticism of the Force.\nOn the Colossus, Mika Grey found work as a fortune teller on the platform's marketplace. Grey gave her customers advice based on their personal desires and fears. One of her customers was the Klatooinian Bolza Grool, a gorg merchant. When Grool asked if he would survive the First Order-Resistance War, Grey predicted that she saw many teeth gnawing on his insides. The superstitious Grool interpreted it to mean that he was in danger from his gorgs.\nAfter the Warbird pirate Leoz cursed Kaz, Xiono visited Mika following a spate of accidents which he blamed on the curse. Mika counseled Kaz that a large part of the curse boiled down to his belief in it. She gave Kaz a talisman in order to ward off \"bad luck\". Though Kaz accidentally left his talisman behind during a skirmish with the Guavian Death Gang, he managed to overcome his fears and lead the Ace Squadron to victory over the criminals.\nRecalling Mika's advice that the curse's power only stemmed from his belief in it, Kaz settled scores with Leoz by handing him his \"lucky charm\". When the superstitious Leoz panicked that he was \"cursed\", an amused Mika quipped that the pirates were a \"superstitious\" lot.\nMika Grey was a dark skinned woman with white hair and green eyes. She had blue tattoos. Mika was physically fit and agile and able to leap out of a deep pit. While Mika was annoyed with Kaz's clumsiness, she accepted his invitation to come aboard the Colossus. She also struck a friendship with Eila, who was curious about the Force.\nWhile working as a fortune teller, Mika exploited her customers' fears and desires. Mika became an informal counselor to Kaz, who believed that he was cursed. Mika counseled him that the power of the curse stemmed from how much he was willing to believe it. She gave him a talisman to ward off the curse.\nMika was an archaeologist and treasure hunter who collected Sith artifacts on order to prevent the Sith from getting hold of them rather than to acquire riches. Mika was also knowledgeable of the Force and did not identify with either the Jedi or the Sith. She believed that the Force did not belong to anyone but was inside everyone.\nAs a fortune teller, Mika was skilled at manipulating people's fears and desires.\nMika Grey first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance Season Two episode \"The Relic Raiders\", which premiered on November 17, 2019. She was voiced by Tudi Roche. According to Lucasfilm Story Group's Pablo Hidalgo, Grey evolved from imagining what Asajj Ventress would have been like had she survived the Clone Wars era.",
