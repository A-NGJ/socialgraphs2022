 "content": "Lyrissa was a Human female who lived on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nLyrissa appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. However, she is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
