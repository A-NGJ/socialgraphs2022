 "content": "Quillara Adeen was a Human female Dark Jedi who existed during the time of the Galactic Civil War. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, she guarded an old Jedi statue on the jungle moon of Yavin 4. During her time on Yavin 4, she encountered and battled a Jedi dispatched by Matarmeno Krahnn, a Human Jedi adventurer hailing from the city of Tyrena on Corellia. Despite being a skilled practitioner of the Force, and making talented use of her single-bladed red lightsaber, Adeen was bested by her Jedi adversary, and transformed into a Force ghost shortly after her apparent death.\nDuring the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a Human male Jedi adventurer by the name of Matarmeno Krahnn hid within the riverside city of Tyrena on the Core World of Corellia.\nDuring his time in Tyrena, Khrahnn encountered yet another Jedi, a rare sight during the reign of the Galactic Empire, as most Jedi had been wiped out by the end of the Great Jedi Purge. As a sort of trial, Matarmeno Krahnn urged the Jedi to look within, and embark on a dangerous undertaking to discover various Jedi artifacts throughout the galaxy, and defeat two Force users; the Mon Calamari Jedi Bre'ano Umakk, and the Human female Dark Jedi Quillara Adeen.\nQuillara Adeen, a practitioner of the dark side of the Force, was no stranger to battle. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Adeen dwelled on the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where she guarded an old Jedi statue near the Wayward Jungle region. As the Jedi dispatched by Khrahnn approached the old Jedi statue, the physical manifestation of Adeen appeared in a burst of red, fiery smoke, relishing the opportunity to defeat the individual in battle. However, despite her knowledge of the Force, which included an ability to use Force lightning, and her skill with a single-bladed red lightsaber, Adeen was bested by her Jedi adversary. As she succumbed to what appeared to be a mortal death, Adeen uttered her final words, expressing her disbelief at being defeated. However, she also commended the Jedi adversary for proving themselves, and encouraged the Jedi to continue feeding their passion. Adeen then transformed into a Force ghost, before disappearing into a flash of light.\nQuillara Adeen had light freckled skin, auburn hair, and green colored eyes. Her lips were covered with black colored makeup. As a Dark Jedi, Adeen had a hunger for battle. After her defeat at the hands of her Jedi adversary, Adeen was incredulous. Nevertheless, before she faded away, Adeen acknowledged the prowess of her adversary, and urged the individual to cultivate their passion.\nAs a practitioner of the dark side of the Force, Quillara Adeen was capable of using Force lightning. She was also a skilled duelist, as evidenced by her effective use of a lightsaber. The ability to transcend death was an ability thought to be reserved only for those who embraced the light side of the Force. Nevertheless, upon her death, Adeen was able to transform into a glowing blue Force ghost before vanishing into a burst of light.\nDuring her time as a Dark Jedi, Quillara Adeen possessed and made use of a one handed lightsaber with a glowing red energy blade. A traditional Jedi weapon, Adeen's lightsaber consisted of a cylindrical handle in which sophisticated circuits channeled a beam of light through a series of crystals. These crystals modulated the blade's size and amplitude. During her time on Yavin 4, Adeen wore the Cloak of Hate, a black and red garment imbued with the dark side of the Force. Underneath the cloak, Adeen wore a black formal shirt, black and red lined shorts, and black and red Marauder Reconnaissance Armor boots.\nQuillara Adeen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. She was added to the game as part of Game Update 3 on April 29, 2008 in a Jedi Robe Collection titled \"Master Jedi Cloaks\".\nJedi players who spoke to Matarmeno Krahnn in the city of Tyrena on Corellia could accept the collection and complete it for the opportunity to obtain two types of cloaks; the Cloak of Hate, and the Shatterpoint Cloak. To complete the collection, players had to acquire multiple holocrons and lightsaber schematics, and demonstrate their combat prowess against the NPCs Bre'ano Umakk and Quillara Adeen, the latter of which spawned on Yavin 4.\nThere is perhaps some ambiguity regarding Quillara Adeen's portrayal in Star Wars Galaxies. Whether she was a mortal being, or some sort of spiritual entity was not explicitly described in any of the quest dialogue. When players interacted with the old Jedi statue on Yavin 4 to summon Adeen, she would suddenly appear in a burst of red smoke, and fight the player as a physical entity. Then, once defeated, she would briefly transform into a blue Force ghost, before disappearing altogether. Judging from this brief interaction, this article surmises that Adeen was a living physical being until her death at the hands of the player. Although the player could choose not to complete the collection, this article assumes 100% game completion.\nThe fact that Quillara Adeen, a Dark Jedi, was able to transform into a Force ghost, might appear to pose something of a continuity problem in the Star Wars Legends continuity. In both the novel and the comic book version of Revenge of the Sith, the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn tells Yoda that only light-siders may live on as Force ghosts, and that this is something that dark-siders cannot learn. However, in fact, in Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, Darth Sidious reveals that the ancient Sith Lords once had the ability to \"survive death,\" but this knowledge was somehow lost over time. Moreover, Exar Kun demonstrated this power.",
