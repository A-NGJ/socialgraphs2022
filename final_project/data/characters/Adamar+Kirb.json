 "content": "Adamar Kirb was a male Chevin slave who became a famous gangster and established his own cartel on the moon of Nar Shaddaa. Kirb's cartel eventually broke apart into many smaller gangs, but his influence was still felt by the time of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nAdamar Kirb was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Chevin species in the beta release of Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game by BioWare and LucasArts. However, the entry, along with many of the entries that could be found on the planet Dromund Kaas, were removed from the game before the game's final release in 2011. However, the entry was later added into the game with Game Update 2.10 on September 9, 2014.",
