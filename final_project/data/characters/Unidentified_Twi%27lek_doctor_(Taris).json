 "content": "During the Galactic Republic's attempted resettlement of the planet Taris, a male Twi'lek worked as a doctor. In the year 3643 BBY, he treated the individual known as Jessop, who had been bitten by a rakghoul, a type of Sithspawn that roamed Taris.\nWhen it became clear that Jessop had been infected with the rakghoul plague, which transformed the infected into rakghouls, the doctor was forced to kill his patient. While in the settlement of Olaris, the Twi'lek talked to a Republic soldier who had been friends with Jessop. After revealing to the soldier his friend's fate, the doctor offered to take him to a grief counselor.\nThe doctor had green skin and blue eyes. He believed killing Jessop would be better than letting him live as a rakghoul, and attempted to comfort the soldier upon telling him of Jessop's death.\nThe doctor was created for the 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, developed by BioWare. In the game, the doctor appears as a non-player character only identified as \"Weary Doctor.\"",
