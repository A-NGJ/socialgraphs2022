 "content": "Kup'bree'ak was a male Togruta. He traveled to Cerosha to earn a living as a gambler. He won a fortune in Solace, but by using underhanded methods. It was those actions, including the accidental death of a rival gambler, that attracted the attention of the figure that was mythologized as the Dark Wraith. The figure visited Kup'bree'ak in his coin vault, killing him.\nKup'bree'ak first appeared in the 2019 short story \"The Dark Wraith\", in the anthology Myths \u0026 Fables.",
