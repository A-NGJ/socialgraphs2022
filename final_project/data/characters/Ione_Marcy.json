 "content": "Ione Marcy was a Salenga female thief who lived on the planet Coruscant during the Clone Wars.\nIone Marcy was a female Salenga and small-time criminal on the planet Coruscant during the Clone Wars. She lived with her boyfriend, the Trandoshan hitman Nack Movers, in his apartment. The Coruscant Security Force repeatedly tried and failed to bring him to justice for his murders. Due to his growing paranoia, he hired the Terrelian Jango Jumper and thief Cassilyda Cryar, also known as \"Cassie,\" to be his assistant and bodyguard. Marcy and Cryar grew close and became partners, which Movers failed to notice. Ignoring his girlfriend's entreaties, he made a lecherous proposition to Cryar. The two women began plotting to kill him and poisoned his drink with Sennari poison, which he used himself to kill his victims and was more susceptible to due to his Trandoshan biology. As he died, his claws raked across a painting of the three beings together.\nMovers had recently acquired the lightsaber of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Marcy and Cryar had ransacked the apartment when they were discovered by Tano and Jedi Master Tera Sinube. Though she pretended to be innocent, Marcy did not fool the Jedi. Sinube was able to tag her with a tracking device before she escaped in her RGC-16 airspeeder. Cryar had taken the lightsaber when she fled, pursued by Tano, and she soon reunited with Marcy. They did not escape custody for long; the Jedi successfully tracked them to a train station, and they were arrested.\nIn the years after \"Lightsaber Lost\" aired, some viewers posted in venues such as the Jedi Council Forums that there appeared to be romantic subtext between Ione Marcy and Cassie Cryar. Pablo Hidalgo mentioned via his Twitter account in 2016 that they were written to be a couple. He subsequently wrote the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious that made this detail more apparent. Marcy's species was first identified as Salenga in the 2021 reference book Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!.",
