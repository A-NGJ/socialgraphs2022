 "content": "Pachwenko was a male Jawa of Chief Nebit's tribe.\nA male Jawa, Pachwenko was a member of a tribe of Jawas on Tatooine led by Nebit. He was called \"Patches\" by local Human settlers because of his patchwork robes. As the tribe scavenged the wastes of the Dune Sea in 0 BBY, the Jawas came across two droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, and sold them to the Lars family. He was killed not long after by stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire who were searching for the droids.\nTo some fans, Pachwenko is known as one of the \"Freak Giant Jawas,\" or \"Tall Jawas.\"",
