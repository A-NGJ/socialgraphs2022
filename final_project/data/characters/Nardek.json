 "content": "Nardek was a Human male and a member of the Wind Raiders tribe on the planet of Taloraan during the Clone Wars.\nIn 21 BBY, while performing a flight on his fleft-wauf, another Wind Raider, Jeru, had caught a Togruta female falling from the sky and intended to take her as a prize. Nardek disputed his claim and Bafor, the tribe's Chief, decided that the two would have to fight over the female. The female, who happened to be Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, refused to be anyone's prize and insisted on joining the combat as well. Physically stronger, Nardek quickly defeated Jeru and was going to take the Togruta for himself. Ahsoka, however, surprised him by demonstrating extreme agility and easily defeated him, using the Force.",
