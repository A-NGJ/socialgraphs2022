 "content": "A Neimoidian served as a gunnery officer aboard General Grievous's flagship, Invisible Hand. He was present on the ship during the Battle of Coruscant in 19 BBY. The Neimoidian was promoted to senior gunnery officer after the previous officer was killed by Grievous for failing to obey orders in time. However, he didn't have long to enjoy his new position, as he was killed shortly after when his console exploded.",
