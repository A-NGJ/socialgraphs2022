 "content": "Raskta Fenni was a female Echani who lived before the Jedi Civil War. She was considered one of the greatest duelists of her time, and many Echani foils were crafted in her honor. Unfortunately, they were mass-produced and lacked quality, often breaking in combat. Many millennia later, Jedi Master Raskta Lsu was named after her.",
