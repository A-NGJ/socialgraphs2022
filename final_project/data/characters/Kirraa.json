 "content": "Kirraa was a female Human slave who worked at the Shipyards of Gwori during the Clone Wars.\nKirraa was one of the slaves used as insurance by overseer Juhm at the Shipyards of Gwori, and helped convince the shipyard foreman Mirax that he made the wrong decision in giving up Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano to Juhm. She was also overseer Juhm's personal slave to a begrudging extent. Before the bombing of the Shipyard, she stole back her Jedi saviors' lightsabers and was granted citizenship to the Galactic Republic along with the other slaves.\nKirraa is one of only two slaves to be given a name in the book. It appears in the book that she and Obi-Wan Kenobi have a relationship, as he is the one to name her and at the end Kenobi is seen waving to her.",
