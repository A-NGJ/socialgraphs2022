 "content": "Doctor Pineas Pontak was a bald Human male scientist who created the Pontak Hypergland.\nIn addition to desiring the Hypergland, the nefarious Gaar Suppoon also wanted Pontak himself so that he could put the scientist to work in his laboratories. Jabba Desilijic Tiure gave Suppoon both the Hypergland and its inventor during a meeting in Suppoon's palace, after one of his former test subjects, the Force-sensitive Gamorrean guard Thok, exposed his location to Jabba. Since the Hutt had no intention of letting his rival survive the meeting, he had secretly removed Dr. Pontak's brain, which left him a mindless zombie.",
