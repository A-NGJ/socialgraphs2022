 "content": "Dajan-Ko was a male Voss who lived during the Cold War. Dajan-Ko raised his grandson Gaden-Ko and noticed the young Gaden-Ko's uncanny intuition, that marked him as a potential Mystic visionary. Dajan-Ko accompanied Gaden-Ko to the Holy Path of Mir as part of his pilgrimage to become a Mystic, but was slain by shaclaws. Dajan-Ko later appeared in a vision to observe his grandson and judged his valor. At the end of the training Dajan congratulated with Gaden and approved his decision to explore the galaxy.",
