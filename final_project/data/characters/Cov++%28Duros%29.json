 "content": "Cov was a Duros admiral of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a veteran of many battles. He claimed descent from King Kadlo of Duro, and when the Kadlo Talisman, an artifact from Kadlo's reign, was looted from a tomb, Cov was told by an informant that it had been spotted in the Duro system and hired several individuals to locate it. They found the talisman in the possession of several of Cov's mutinous crewmen, who had been bought out by DurAble, a corporation whose interests lay contrary to Cov's.",
