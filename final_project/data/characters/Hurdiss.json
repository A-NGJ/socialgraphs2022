 "content": "Hurdiss was a Human male who served as a communications chief aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor during the Galactic Civil War. He was one of the Imperial Navy's many communication specialists, and he coordinated and monitored Star Destroyer fleet movements during challenging tactical situations. In the year 3 ABY, Hurdiss was aboard the Executor during the warship's pursuit of the fugitive Rebel freighter Millennium Falcon through the Anoat system.\nHurdiss, a Human male, was a communication specialist in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. During challenging tactical situations, he coordinated and monitored Star Destroyer fleet movements. Hurdiss was the communications chief aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, the flagship of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, by the year 3 ABY.\nFollowing a Viper probe droid's discovery of the hidden Rebel base on the planet Hoth that same year, the Galactic Empire launched a ground assault during which the Rebel Alliance was forced to retreat from their headquarters on the planet. Following the victory, the Executor, along with the Imperial-class Star Destroyers of Vader's personal fleet, Death Squadron, pursued the freighter Millennium Falcon—carrying the fugitive Rebel operatives Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa—after the vessel's escape into the Hoth asteroid field. Chief Hurdiss served aboard the Executor's command bridge during the pursuit and was present at his console when the warship lost the Millennium Falcon near the Anoat system. Vader ordered Admiral Firmus Piett—the Star Dreadnought's commanding officer—to detect all possible escape routes the Millennium Falcon could have taken, and to deploy Death Squadron in pursuit. Piett relayed the orders to deploy the Imperial fleet to Hurdiss, who responded and helped the Admiral carry out his commands. The Executor, along with the rest of Death Squadron, dispersed into hyperspace in search of the Millennium Falcon.\nHurdiss was a fair-skinned man with dark hair. He wore a light gray technician's uniform and a dark gray cap.\nHurdiss first appeared as a technician on the Executor during the Empire's Hoth campaign in 1980's Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, wherein he was played by an uncredited extra. In April 1980, shortly before the film's release, Hurdiss appeared in a film still in The Empire Strikes Back Storybook, a young readers' adaptation of the movie. In April 1997, Hurdiss was given a name and a brief backstory by the \"Comm Chief\" card released in the Dagobah Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
