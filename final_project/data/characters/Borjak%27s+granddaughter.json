 "content": "The granddaughter of Borjak was a female Feeorin from Odryn. She had a short conversation with Zayne Carrick and Marn Hierogryph while they were imprisoned by the Feeorin. In the aftermath of the destruction of the Sanctum and the death of the current Exalted, Borjak had his granddaughter throw Feln's lightsaber into the rubble.\nIn his notes, John Jackson Miller confirmed that Borjak's granddaughter has a name but refused to mention it for now.",
