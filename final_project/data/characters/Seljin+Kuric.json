 "content": "Seljin Kuric was a male Rodian major of the Alliance to Restore the Republic who served as the second in command and liaison between the Wookiee resistance and Rebel Alliance on Kashyyyk during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSeljin Kuric appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Kuric would have been in some way involved with the 2005 expansion pack, Rage of the Wookiees. However, Kuric is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character, despite being referenced as an upcoming character in an IGN Entertainment news article a month prior to the expansion's release. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
