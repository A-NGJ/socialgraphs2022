 "content": "The disappointed moisture farmer's daughter was the teenage daughter of a Human farmer on Tatooine. She was disappointed when her father was not able to purchase any droids from a clan of Jawas.\nThis individual only appears in the story Oh!! Jawajawa, published in Star Wars Manga: Silver issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under the Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical.",
