 "content": "Alem \"Whisper\" Reesus was a male Twi'lek gunslinger living during the Galactic War. He was mute ever since the Hutts cut out his tongue when he was a kid. In 3630 BBY \"Whisper\" found himself on Port Nowhere when it was taken over by the Crimson Fang gang. Unhappy with the takeover, Whisper bided his time until he was able to send message to Hylo Visz. Hylo was working with the Eternal Alliance strike team currently liberating Port Nowhere and asked them to assist Whisper. They helped him win a firefight he was cornered in, after which Whisper in turn assisted them against Elarea Aldraste. Following the battle, though, he chose not to join the Alliance and went his own way.\nAlem \"Whisper\" Reesus appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the \"Crimson Fang\" Uprising.",
