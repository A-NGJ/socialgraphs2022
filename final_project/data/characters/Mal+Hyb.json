 "content": "Mal Hyb was a mechanic. She was one of Barada's assistants in the garage of Jabba's Palace, and was particularly noted for her superior welding skill. She was also a good fighter; her fighting ability often surprised her opponents, since as a Human she was considerably smaller than many other residents of the palace.",
