 "content": "Ian Lago was a Human male from Naboo who was the son of King Veruna's Prime Councilor, Kun Lago.\nLago sometimes worked as a page at the Royal Palace in Naboo's capital city of Theed. At the end of the corrupt King Veruna's reign, he fell in love with the then-Princess of Theed, Padmé Naberrie, when he saw her for the first time in the Palace Plaza. He would later accompany her and her parents to Coruscant as a volunteer at the spaceport docks of the Refugee Relief Movement.\nDuring his brief relationship with Padmé, Ian's father, Kun Lago, secretly found out about their relationship and even witnessed them kissing. And though Ian failed to disclose to Padmé his father's position in Veruna's court, she later found out on her own. Ian's father forbade him to ever see Padmé again and threatened to disown Ian if he did not comply with his wishes.\nIan was near at hand when King Veruna abdicated the throne due to scandal and other political pressures. But before Padmé was officially elected to the monarchy of Naboo and became Queen Amidala, Ian declared his love to her; even so, she ended their relationship to devote her time to the people of Naboo. Padmé sensed that Veruna's abdication must be taking a toll on Ian's family, and she advised him to return home to them. Though she would always care for him, and treasure the time they'd spent together over the summer, she had pledged her heart to the people years ago when she left her mountain village.\nHeartbroken, Ian departed from Naboo to parts unknown.\nHowever, by the time of the Galactic Civil War following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Ian Lago returned to Naboo and served as the planet's governor. As governor, Ian Lago was openly loyal to the Galactic Empire, and worked closely with an aide of his named Junelle Astor. During this time, a spacer wishing to serve the governor assisted Astor with a number of political issues. For instance, she tasked the spacer with protecting Queen Kylantha from High Inquisitor Mal Sikander, who believed the Queen was secretly aiding the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Eventually, Astor cleared the spacer and granted access to the governor's office.\nIan Lago was pleased to have the individual work under him. His first task for the spacer was to deliver surveillance equipment to an agent of his named Eevas Drupper, who was investigating reports of a group of Gungans aiding the Rebellion. The spacer succeeded, but Ian Lago soon encountered a problem involving another one of his agents, a Gungan named Boona Deeks. Deeks was loyal to the Empire, and was aiding the governor with spying on traitorous Gungans. However, Deeks's allegiance was uncovered by his fellow Gungans, forcing him to flee. His life in danger, Deeks hid inside the dead body of a bola for a couple days before being rescued by the spacer dispatched by Governor Lago.\nGovernor Ian Lago, despite being supportive of the Empire, was annoyed by High Inquisitor Mal Sikander's persistent attempts to accuse Queen Kylantha of treachery. When one of Sikander's agents managed to acquire the queen's private correspondence, he tasked the spacer with killing the traitor, hoping it would send a clear message to the Inquisitor. The spacer succeeded, but he ended up also having to capture a troubadour named Ryd Rozen when it became clear that he was the one who aided Sikander's agent with stealing the queen's property. Eventually though, Queen Kylantha did in fact end up supporting a group of Gungans implicated with treasonous activities. To defuse the situation, Governor Lago tasked the spacer with traveling to the Gungan's camp, and killing their leader, Yip Kanoos.\nAnother situation then developed, involving a lieutenant of Captain Rhys Dallows named Leana Kilnar. When Governor Lago learned that Lieutenant Kilnar was under investigation by Sikander, he tasked the spacer with eliminating her.",
