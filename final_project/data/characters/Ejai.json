 "content": "Ejai was a fair-skinned Human male with brown hair who served the Galactic Empire as a lieutenant colonel in 19 BBY. With the Empire having formed that year, Ejai was one of the first Imperial officers. He served aboard one of the Venator-class Star Destroyers overseeing the construction of the Empire's DS-1 Orbital Battle Station.\nIn 19 BBY, Ejai was overseeing the Star Destroyer's bridge pit crews when Emperor Palpatine, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, and Governor Wilhuff Tarkin were aboard to oversee the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station's construction. Ejai had a disciplined expression commanding respect and wore the standard Imperial officer's uniform.\nPortrayed by Alex Lissine, who was uncredited, Ejai was created for the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Prior to the film's May 19, 2005 release, Ejai was first pictured in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary, released April 2 the same year. He was first named by Trisha Biggar's reference book Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars, published on October 11 of that year. The scene Ejai appeared in was filmed September 17, 2003 at Fox Studios, Sydney.",
