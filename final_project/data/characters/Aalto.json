 "content": "Aalto was a male Force-sensitive Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was accepted by the Jedi Order to be trained at the Jedi Temple on the Republic's capital planet, Coruscant. There, he befriended fellow Jedi Initiate Bruck Chun. In 44 BBY, another Initiate named Obi-Wan Kenobi was not accepted for training as a Jedi Padawan and sent to the Agricultural Corps. Together with Chun, Aalto often teased Kenobi about his failure.\nAalto had a brief appearance in Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force, the first novel of the Jedi Apprentice series. The Rising Force was written by Dave Wolverton and published in 1999. Nine years after this, Aalto received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia and later on the official StarWars.com Databank.",
