 "content": "Elth Nardah was an older Human male, with wizened skin and stooped shoulders. He was known to have dressed well, in the style of the Old Republic. He held the title of doctor and was a member of the Alliance Diplomatic Corps. His primary concern was keeping primitive populations from becoming slaves to the Empire.\nHe spent time on Karra with the native Karran trying to negotiate a treaty between them and the Rebel Alliance. He was killed by Tist and a group of Karran warriors who were upset that he took the Imperial Governor Darryn Edalm prisoner rather than killing him outright.",
