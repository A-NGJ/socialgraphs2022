 "content": "Prior to becoming a Jedi Knight, Vernestra Rwoh belonged to a Mirialan family group. After Rwoh's Force-sensitivity was discovered, the family group was happy as Force-sensitivity was a cause for celebration for Mirialans. Following Mirialan custom, members of the group, including Rwoh, had family-specific markings of six tiny black diamonds stacked in two rows of three tattooed on the outside corner of their eyes.\nVernestra Rwoh's family group was first mentioned in the 2021 junior novel The High Republic: A Test of Courage.",
