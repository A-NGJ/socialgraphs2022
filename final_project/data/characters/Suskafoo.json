 "content": "Suskafoo, or Foo to his friends, was a pale green Verpine.\nSuskafoo lived on a fringe asteroid of the Roche asteroid field. His asteroid was the first contacted by the Rebel Alliance. From that time onwards, Suskafoo became something of a student of galactic culture, reading extensively on alien cultures and using his programming experience to master Galactic Basic. He then became a mediator between his hive and the \"Rebel Hive.\"\nSuskafoo was incredibly curious about technology, and loved working on theoretical problems. He was involved in the design of the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter, a joint project with the Mon Calamari, and was a member of Dagger Squadron, the Alliance's first B-wing squadron. Suskafoo also had a great interest in the Force, which he sustained by asking many questions whenever the opportunity presented itself.\nAlthough not named in Star Wars: Rebellion 13, Jeremy Barlow confirmed that the Verpine was Suskafoo on the Jedi Council Forums.",
