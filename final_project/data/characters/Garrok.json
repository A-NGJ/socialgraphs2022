 "content": "Garrok was a male Tusken Raider chief who lived on the desert world of Tatooine during the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. In the year 3643 BBY, he was killed whilst amongst the Tusken camps built in the Northern Jundland Wastes.\nGarrok appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Tatooine. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
