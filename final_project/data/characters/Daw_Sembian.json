 "content": "Daw Sembian was a male Twi'lek weaponsmith who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was the father of Vil Sembian. When he died, he left his son a schematic for a new type of blaster which could tip the scales in the Galactic Civil War.\nDaw Sembian was the father of Vil Sembian. He was also a famous weaponsmith who created a schematic for a new type of blaster which could tip the scales in the Galactic Civil War. Daw died some time prior to the Battle of Yavin, but left the schematics for the blaster to his son. In 1 ABY, Vil Sembian headed to Anchorhead on Tatooine to deliver the schematics to his friend, a Rebel captain named Nitra Vendallan.\nHowever, the Empire was on his tail, so Nitra Vendallan sent a Rebel spacer to find Vil and bring him back safely to town. Despite facing resistance from Imperial forces, the spacer succeeded in escorting Vil. Vendallan was pleased, and saw to it that the schematics made it to Alliance High Command.\nDaw Sembian was a character briefly mentioned in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Players who performed a series of quests for Nitra Vendallan in Anchorhead learned that Daw Sembian was a famous weaponsmith who created the schematics for a new type of blaster.",
