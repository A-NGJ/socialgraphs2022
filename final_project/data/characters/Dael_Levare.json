 "content": "Dael Levare was a member of one of Corellia's richest families during the early years of the Galactic Empire. He played Net-ball, and was once engaged to Bria Tharen. Tharen's mother had been pushing them together for years, but Bria broke up with Dael when she found out he was cheating on her. Their wedding was called off, much to Sera Tharen's disgust.\nLater, when Bria returned to Corellia with Han Solo, Levare recognized Han and called him Tallus Bryne, an alias Solo had once used while involved in a con, forcing the couple to leave Corellia. Levare had also watched Han win the Corellian swoop championship and was a big fan. At this time Dael Levare was in a new relationship with Sulen Belos.",
