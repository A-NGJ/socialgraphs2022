 "content": "Ar'al Anec was a male Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the Cold War, Anec was a part of a joint team sent by the Empire and House Thul to establish a base in old Jedi ruins in the Glarus Valley on Alderaan.\nHe was killed there by a Republic-allied individual who was sent to stop Sith activities in the ruins.\nAnec appears in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a boss character during the quest to kill Sith commanders in the ruins. It is not necessary to kill Anec to complete the quest. However, this article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
