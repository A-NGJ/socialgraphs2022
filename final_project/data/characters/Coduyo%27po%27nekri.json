 "content": "Coduyo'po'nekri, also known by the core name of Yoponek, was a Chiss male of the Coduyo family and the betrothed of Yomie. Yoponek was a student of history.\nHe and Yomie embarked on a wandering year prior to their final education, choosing to travel the Chiss Ascendancy. When Haplif of the Agbui attempted to study the Chiss in order to spark a civil war within the Ascendancy, he encountered Yomie and Yoponek, offering them passage aboard his starship; he claimed it would save the two Chiss funds and provide guidance for the Agbui, but in reality wished to learn about the Ascendancy.\nYoponek was ambitious in his career goals as a politician, seeking to network with mid- and high-ranking officials of other Chiss families. Haplif exploited this trait to maneuver into meeting Councilor Lakuviv on Celwis.\nYoponek first appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good, written by Timothy Zahn.",
