 "content": "Tiu Zax was an Omwati female serving as a Jedi Knight in the time following the resolution of the Swarm War. She was knighted shortly before the Second Galactic Civil War.\nZax participated in Operation Roundabout as part of Team Tauntaun, which was tasked with kidnapping Chief of State Thrackan Sal-Solo. However, it was a trap, just like Jaina Solo's Team Purella's mission, and Tiu's fellow teammembers, Tahiri Veila and Doran Sarkin-Tainer, had to flee. Tainer had the idea to disguise Tiu as being dead, so that he and Tahiri could escape. Tiu then stayed in Sal-Solo's estate and did recon work. She was later retrieved by Mara Jade Skywalker and did more recon work with her.",
