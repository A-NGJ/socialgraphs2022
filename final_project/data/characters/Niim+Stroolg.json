 "content": "Niim Stroolg was a male Caarite who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He worked for the Metatheran Cartel and eventually became an executive in charge of \"resource investigation\", serving as an overseer to some of the Cartel's mining operations. During the Confederation Rock Rush in c. 31 BBY, Stroolg and five other Caarites traveled into the Cularin system asteroid belt aboard the starship MCT Nuurglat, and landed in a cavern inside an asteroid. However, they inadvertently reawoke a shadow creature that was slumbering inside the rock, and it drove Stroolg and the other Caarites to inflict fatal wounds on themselves. The Heroes of Cularin later traveled to the asteroid, and they discovered the bodies of Stroolg and his crew.",
