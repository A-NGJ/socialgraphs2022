 "content": "Astrid Fenris was a human female from Yir Tangee who worked as a smuggler during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 10 BBY, Fenris spent time on the planet Vandor where she ran a scam that involved exporting Vandor ice and selling it as valuable R'alla mineral water. After the smuggler Han Solo made the Kessel Run in only 12 parsecs, Fenris claimed he had done it by flying between two black holes in the Maw Cluster. She declared that she would find the route and claim it for her own, but then began avoiding the topic when anyone brought it up.\nAstrid Fenris was a smuggler from Yir Tangee who spent time on the icey planet Vandor during the reign of the Galactic Empire. While there, she ran a scam in which she exported relatively worthless Vandor ice and then sold it to gullible customers as expensive R'alla mineral water, which they believed had rejuvenating properties.\nIn the year 10 BBY, Fenris was present in the drinking establishment known as the Lodge in the settlement of Fort Ypso on Vandor and was stood speaking to another human when the smuggler Han Solo and the Crimson Dawn lieutenant Qi'ra passed them while discussing a sabacc game Solo had just lost.\nSolo and his colleagues later made the Kessel Run in a record twelve parsecs on the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon, causing much debate amongst spacers who knew the route, including Fenris. She was incorrectly dubious of the route Solo claimed to have used and wrote a note in a book kept by Midnight—a barkeeper at the Lodge—claiming she would prove he had taken a different route.\nHer theory was that Solo had flown the freighter between two black holes in the Maw Cluster, and therefore the credit for the run should go to the gambler Lando Calrissian, who owned the ship at the time and so had been responsible for any modifications that allowed it to survive the pull of the black holes. After she declared her intent to find Solo's route and claim it for her own, patrons began asking her if she had tested her theory yet each time she visited the Lodge. As Fenris was unable to determine which two of the many black holes in the Maw Solo had supposedly used, she began avoiding the topic and would quickly become interested in any other subject when asked about it.\nFenris insisted that her Vandor ice scam was only a short-term scheme which she needed to carry out in order to pay off several debts. She had fair skin, brown eyes and white hair, which she wore in a Mandalorian-style bob haircut.\nFenris piloted a modified YT-2400 freighter known as the Silver Howl. While on Vandor she wore a brown synth-hide capelet with concealed pockets over a tan shirt and a pair of black pants. She also wore a belt with a holster in which she carried a Ophidiax-350 heavy blaster pistol.\nAstrid Fenris first appeared in the 2018 Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first identified in the accompanying reference guide Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
