 "content": "Ter-Idi was a male Cerean Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic before falling to the dark side of the Force and establishing a major criminal empire on Coruscant.\nA Force-sensitive Cerean, Ter-Idi was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Selected for further training to be a Jedi Consular as a Padawan to Jedi Master Kal-Don, Ter-Idi had an apathetic outlook towards the lure of the dark side, something that concerned Kal-Don and the other Jedi Masters. Their worst fears were realized when Ter-Idi suffered an incapacitating injury at the hands of an assassin attempting to murder Master Kal-Don.\nThrough his recovery, Ter-Idi realized that the injury would leave him less agile than before. As frustration set in, the lure of the dark side offered to replenish his speed and strength to levels greater than before the trauma. Unfortunately, Ter-Idi's apparent indifference to the dark side made his fall that much easier; Ter-Idi left Master Kal-Don and the Order, never to be seen again by Kal-Don or any other Jedi. Disappearing into the underworld of Coruscant using techniques learned that the Temple to hide his Force use, he honed his skills in the Force to ensure that he would rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld. After a time, Ter-Idi had established one of the largest purveyors of information on the planet. Walking with a cane, Ter-Idi was skilled in many languages, having mastered Cerean, Dosh, Ryl, Bothese and Ithorese.",
