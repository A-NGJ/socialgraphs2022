 "content": "Braedon Agareth was a male Human who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War. He was forcibly pressed into service by the Justicars' Brigade, but he was freed by a Republic-allied individual who was asked by his sister Renalda to save him.\nBraedon and his sister Renalda lived in the Justicars' Sector, a region on Coruscant controlled by the militant vigilante group known as the Justicars' Brigade. They lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, surviving the widespread violence and destruction in the years that followed the Sacking of Coruscant by the Sith.\nBy the year 3643 BBY, both of the Agareth's parents had died and Braedon, at the age of 15, was raising his sister on his own. But one night, Braedon was caught by the Justicars out after curfew and because he looked older, he was pressed into indentured service as a Justicar. Renalda asked a Republic-allied individual to rescue Braedon, but Braedon told the hero that the Justicars would simply capture him again if his name remained in their file of curfew violations. While the individual destroyed the files, Braedon went into hiding and told them that he would contact Renalda when it was safe.\nBraedon Agareth was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Braedon is the target of the Coruscant mission \"Justicar Injustice\", where his sister Renalda asks Republic characters to rescue her brother from the Justicar Tower. The player frees Braedon, and then erases his records from the Justicars' computers so Braedon can escape.",
