 "content": "Raffid Girard was the womanizing son of Zacar Girard. Alive during the Cold War, Raffid seduced at least one married Thul woman before his father was murdered by unknown means. The hired Bounty Hunter killed him and the entire house Girard as another contract they took.\nFemale Bounty Hunters can romance Raffid. Raffid's fate is determined by the Bounty Hunter. If he is made Baron, Raffid can offer the Hunter either the title of Knight or Baroness . If Aitalla is made Baroness, she exiles Raffid. Raffid can also be killed if the Hunter allies with House Rist. He is voiced by Troy Hall.",
