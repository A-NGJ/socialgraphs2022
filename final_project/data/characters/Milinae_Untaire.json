 "content": "Milinae Untaire was a female Human Corellian smuggler, who lived during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. Milinae was the identical twin sister of Trilinae Untaire, who, unlike Milinae, was Force-sensitive and joined the Jedi Order. During the Clone Wars, Milinae went on a mission with Trilinae and the Jedi Master Darrus Jeht to learn the identity of the mysterious crime lord R. They landed on his space station in the Cularin system and infiltrated the facility, but were unsuccessful at learning much about him. R had Milinae's starship destroyed, and the trio were forced to steal a yacht in order to escape. Later during the conflict, in about 19 BBY, Trilinae went missing and Milinae sent a transmission to Jeht, to enlist his help with finding her sister. She also informed him that the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy situated on the planet Almas in the Cularin system, had recently been destroyed, a fact that disturbed him greatly. Untaire boarded Jeht's warship, the Maelstrom and Jeht had it immediately depart for the Cularin system. However, on arrival there, the vessel became engaged in a battle with the Separatist capital ship Shadowblade, and Jeht ordered Untaire and the droid R-0 to flee to safety aboard his personal vessel, the Legacy.",
