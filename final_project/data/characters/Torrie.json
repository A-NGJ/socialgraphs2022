 "content": "Captain Torrie was a male Mon Calamari who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Under the callsign \"Starfall leader,\" Captain Torrie led Task Force Starfall in the attack of the Victory-class Star Destroyer Subjugator at Kwenn Space Station. After a group of Alliance agents aided in the escape of Walex Blissex from the Subjugator, Captain Torrie picked up their shuttle and congratulated them on their efforts.\nCaptain Torrie was created for the West End Games RPG adventure module Starfall as the commander of the task force of the same name. His species was not established until the release of Classic Adventure: Volume Five, which included Starfall with additional pictures, including one of Torrie.",
