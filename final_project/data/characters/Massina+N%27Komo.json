 "content": "Massina N'Komo was a female Human and an astrogator in the Republic Navy.\nN'Komo graduated from the Procion II cadet center and soon after embarked on a diplomatic mission under the lead of Karl Descemovitch.\nN'Komo was haughty and taciturn, but focused entirely on her work. She had little consideration for her colleagues or passengers, who she tended to see as mere \"tourists.\"\nMassina N'Komo was created by Franck Vidal for an ambiguously Legends canon roleplaying scenario which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 2.\nFor gameplay purposes, her characteristics were those of Mon Mothma, misspelled \"Man Mothma\".",
