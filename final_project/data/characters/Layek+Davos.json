 "content": "Layek Davos was an admiral in the Imperial Navy of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War and the subsequent Cold War. He fought in the Imperial victory at the Battle of Hoth. During the Galactic War he was still stationed on Hoth and tried with all means to achieve a promotion. During the Cold War, while serving as the commander of Imperial Search and Recovery, along with few trusted men such as Captain Leo Furth, he made an alliance with the Marauders group of the White Maw pirates and attempted to seize the prized shuttle Starbreeze from the hangar bay of the Star of Coruscant in the Starship Graveyard. However, Cipher Nine and Raina Temple interrupted their attempts and in the ensuing firefight both Davos was killed.",
