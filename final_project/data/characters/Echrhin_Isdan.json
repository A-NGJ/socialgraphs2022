 "content": "Echrhin Isdan was a male Tulgah living among the Myyydril tribe within the Myyydril Caverns in the Kkowir Forest on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War in 1.5 ABY.\nHe asked an adventurer exploring the caves to gather ten smooth stones from the river and pond outside the cave. When the spacer returned, Isdan gave him a mystical glowing stone that would teleport the spacer from anywhere in the caverns back to Kachirho.\nEchrhin Isdan was a Non-Player Character  in Rage of the Wookiees, the second addon to Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He could be found in the Myyydril village in the Myyydril Caverns, where players could talk to him to start a simple quest. The player had to go outside the caverns and search for stones in the area around the cavern entrance. The reward for the quest was a mystical stone that could be used in the caves to teleport back to Kachirho. It spared players the long way back through the caves and Kkowir Forest area, where vehicles could not be used.",
