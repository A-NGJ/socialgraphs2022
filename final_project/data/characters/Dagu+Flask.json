 "content": "Dagu Flask was a male Weequay pirate and a member of Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang during the Clone Wars.\nIn 22 BBY, Count Dooku was kidnapped by the pirate gang, and they demanded a spice ransom from the Republic in exchange for the Count. The Republic sent Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to the pirate base on Florrum to confirm the capture of Dooku. Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the gang, was eager to triple the ransom, so he captured the Jedi too. The Sith Lord and the Jedi tried to escape on many an occasion, but were recaptured each time.\nDuring one such escape, the prisoners attempted to escape by pole-vaulting over the wall of the pirate outpost. They succeeded only partially, with Skywalker clinging to the edge of the wall, while Kenobi and Dooku held on to his legs. Meanwhile Flask and several other pirates opened fire upon the escapees. Anakin couldn't hold on any longer and told Kenobi to drop Dooku. Suddenly, Flask ordered a cease-fire. Ohnaka was then standing on the wall, and told his men to arrest the prisoners.\nTwo years later, Dagu fought alongside Hondo against their own pirates that defected to side with Darth Maul and Savage Opress in their conquest for power. He was killed during the skirmish after trying to defend the base and was shot to death.\nFlask was a master sniper. He had a lot of experience with blaster rifles.",
