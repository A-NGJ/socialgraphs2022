 "content": "Jaardu Raax was a Rodian male Crime lord who was the leader of the Scourge that remained on Belsavis during the time of the Cold War and the renewed war between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nFollowing the Treaty of Coruscant, Jaardu Raax was known as a mass murderer when he killed a number of innocent citizens when he set off thermal detonators on a busy Coruscant market street. He was captured by the Republic and was given a life sentence on Belsavis, but that has not stopped his violent ways when he remained on that planet for years.",
