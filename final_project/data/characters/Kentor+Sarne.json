 "content": "Kentor Sarne was a male Human Moff who held control over the Kathol sector during the reign of the Galactic Empire. The Raptor, an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, served under him, as did a special contingent of stormtroopers.\nDuring the height of the New Order, a young Sarne was a Captain in the Imperial Survey Corps. During a navigational malfunction in the Kathol Sector, his ship crashed near the DarkStryder's lair, killing the entire crew except Sarne. He soon found the DarkStryder and struck a deal with the construct - he would trade his hyperdrive technology for the DarkStryder's powerful biotechnology. Sarne was eventually rescued and returned to Imperial Center, where he was assigned to the blockade runner Renegade as part of the 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet.\nSarne returned to the Kathol sector after the Empire's fragmentation, and plotted to take over the galaxy by using the launch gates of the long dead Kathol, the creators of the DarkStryder and the Lifewell. He began building his power base on the planet Kal'Shebbol, until the New Republic removed his grip on the world. Sarne evaded the New Republic forces, escaping his Imperial government complex in the Carrack-class cruiser Ambition and took refuge in the DarkStryder's Fortress.\nSarne later contacted Lancer Brunou about researching the origins of the Aaris people. His former ship, Renegade, was captured by the New Republic and renamed the FarStar, which was ironically tasked with hunting him down. Sarne set up a plethora of death traps and attacks on his former flagship. However, his plans for galactic dominance were cut short when the crew of the FarStar defeated the DarkStryder and opened the Lifewell.\nSarne was killed in the explosion of his Imperial shuttle during the Battle of Kathol System, shot down by Republic forces while he was trying to escape to the Bastion.",
