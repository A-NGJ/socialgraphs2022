 "content": "Vepon-Du was a Voss Mystic living on Voss many years before the planet was discovered by the galactic society. He had a vision that required his own death, lest all of Voss be destroyed. Vepon-Du obeyed the vision and took a step from the Step of Harmony platform in Voss-Ka. The day of his death, Vepon-Du recorded his final thoughts in the Writings of Vepon-Du on a carving outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths.",
