 "content": "This individual was a human male officer who served the First Order during its conflict with the Resistance. The officer was stationed in the primary fire control room of the Command Center of Starkiller Base and helped oversee the charging of the superweapon. As the base was draining the power of a nearby star, the officer informed General Hux that the weapon would be fully charged in thirty seconds, prompting Hux to order the team to prepare to fire the weapon at the Ileenium system, where the Resistance base was located. However, Starkiller base was destroyed by Resistance pilots before the plans could be set into motion.\nThis character was portrayed by Jefferson Hall in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. His role was confirmed in the movie's credits.",
