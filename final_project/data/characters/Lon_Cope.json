 "content": "Lon Cope was a male Human CorSec officer who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Lon Cope was a lieutenant in the Corellian Security Force stationed in the city of Kor Vella.\nIn 1 ABY, Lieutenant Cope was leading the investigation concerning the attempted murder of the mayor of Kor Vella Deel Draav. Cope recruited an independent spacer who previously worked with CorSec Major Alana Walden in Tyrena to help him with the case. The spacer encountered the mayor who mentioned threatening messages he had received at his office. The spacer tracked the messages to an abandoned bunker nearby where evidence was found that seemed to indicate that a political opponent, Hershel Sheridan, had been behind the assassination attempt. Sheridan's body was found soon after in his house; he apparently committed suicide. Although Hershel Sheridan was murdered, the case seemed to be solved and the investigation stopped at this point.\nIn the meantime, the Corellian Security Force was becoming increasingly concerned with the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. As soon as the Sheridan case was closed, Lieutenant Cope was designated to lead the investigation and identify the members of the ryll smuggling ring operating in the city. A spacer working for Lon Cope started by questioning a local spice addict known as Menchi Lerann. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from two spice dealers known as Vuul Sarlin and Jaylon Geissler. The spacer later interrogated Geissler at his Ryll Warehouse but the criminal obviously refused to collaborate. However, after the spacer started to destroy some spice crates in the warehouse, Jaylon Geissler reluctantly accepted to give Vuul Sarlin's current location: a small camp in the plains outside Kor Vella. The spacer therefore attacked the camp and defeated Vuul Sarlin's guards. Sarlin was forced to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring. His contact among the smugglers who provided him with spice was Ladonna Poe and they were based in a bunker nearby. The CorSec agents later raided the Ryll Smuggler Bunker where they discovered a red circle symbol on the crates of unrefined ryll. However, Lieutenant Cope suddenly canceled the assault when he received news that the mayor of Kor Vella Deel Draav had been assassinated.\nLon Cope therefore reopened the Draav and Sheridan case and dispatched his agent to re-examine the body of Hershel Sheridan. Further investigations revealed that the blaster supposedly used for the suicide did not have a power cell. The spacer also discovered a card with a single red circle in Hershel's hand. Cope then sent his agent search the mayor's office. The spacer found an unopened package with a large sum of credits, along with a note signed with a single red circle. It appeared that the credits were given to the mayor in exchange for his collaboration. As the money was never transferred into his account, Cope understood that the mayor was assassinated because he refused corruption while his opponent was murdered to cover the first assassination attempt.\nAs the murders of the politicians were connected to a red circle as well as the ryll smugglers, Lon Cope decided to focus on the ryll smuggling ring in order to confront what he called the Red Circle Gang. During the investigation concerning the assassinated mayor, a CorSec agent following a suspect discovered a small base outside of Kor Vella with guards wearing armbands with a red circle. Investigating spice smuggling, Cope also helped a Rebel Alliance agent by arranging for him a meeting in a cantina in Kor Vella with Ubis Reendorr, a Rodian smuggler involved with the Red Circle Gang. During the meeting, the operative managed to obtain from Reendorr an access card for the Red Circle Base, which he later handed over to Cope. Moreover, the spacer working for Lieutenant Cope later returned to the Ryll Smuggler Bunker where the crates of spice with a red circle were found. The CorSec agent killed the underboss Ubis Reendorr and retrieved an access code for the Red Circle Base. The CorSec then assaulted the Red Circle Base. The spacer used Reendorr's access code to slice the mainframe in the courtyard of the base and learned the identity of the three local Red Circle Gang leaders, Vora Anjek, Annor Fash and Vella Corse, who were soon eliminated in the basement of the base. Furthermore, the spacer discovered in the base databases that the Red Circle Gang was in fact a major criminal organization known as the Chirq Council. The information found revealed that the Chirq Council and its leaders were based in the city of Doaba Guerfel. As the investigation became more complex, the case was transferred to Captain Vitala Baize, a CorSec officer in Doaba Guerfel. Lon Cope communicated all the information he gathered about the Chirq Council to Captain Baize and requested the spacer who helped him to travel to Doaba Guerfel in order to assist Baize. The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.\nLon Cope appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Lon Cope was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
