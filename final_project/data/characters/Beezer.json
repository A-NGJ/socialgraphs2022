 "content": "Corporal Beezer was a human female who served as a communications operative in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. She was trained by veteran Pathfinder sergeant Brooks Carlson. In 4 ABY, both Beezer and Carlson were selected as members of a commando strike team that was sent to the moon of Endor by the Alliance with the objective of disabling an Imperial shield generator built there to protect the Death Star II superweapon.\nUsing the stolen Imperial shuttle Tydirium, the team landed on the moon and proceeded to the rear of the generator, where a security bunker acted as a backdoor. Expecting the Alliance attack, the Imperials ambushed the rebels at the bunker, but they were defeated when the local Ewok population came to the aid of the strike team. The rebels then destroyed the generator, allowing the Alliance Fleet to destroy the Death Star. Beezer had light skin, brown eyes, and brown hair. She wore a green helmet, and a brown jerkin with a white shirt.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, Beezer was pictured in an entry for Rebel troopers on the StarWars.com Encyclopedia. The character was then identified in the English release of \"The Battle of Endor and the Fall of the Empire,\" an entry in De Agostini's Star Wars Encyclopedia series that was originally released in Spanish on June 29, 2021.\nThe image used in the Encyclopedia entry was a promotional photo taken for the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, although Beezer does not appear in the film itself. The photo depicts Beezer, portrayed by stuntwoman Tracey Eddon, and other commandos stood with protagonist Luke Skywalker as their prisoner in one of the Death Star II's corridors. The name Beezer originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used in the short story Night Attack, published in Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi. A card in the 1999 Endor Limited expansion set of the Decipher, Inc. Star Wars Customizable Card Game then linked the name to Eddon's character. The 2008 StarWars.com Hyperspace-exclusive short story Fists of Ion provided the character's first name as Dansra. The story's author Edward M. Erdelac, stated that the name was a tuckerization of his wife's first name.",
