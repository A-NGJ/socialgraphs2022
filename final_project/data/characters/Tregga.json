 "content": "Tregga was a human male Chak-root smuggler from Oslumpex V during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 10 BBY, He was on the ice-covered planet Vandor, where he was present in the saloon known as the Lodge when the human outlaws Han Solo and Lando Calrissian first met over a game of sabacc.\nAt some point Tregga became a regular customer at the Lodge. He would go on to perform several jobs with Han Solo and Chewbacca. At some point, he began to believe that Solo was lying about his childhood. It was Tregga's belief that Han was actually raised by wandering galactic traders, going so far as to speculate that Han had been present at Kashyyyk when the Galactic Republic fought the Separatists there during the Clone Wars, which led to Han being a constant companion of Chewbacca ever since. Tregga relayed these theories to the Lodge's bartender Midnight.\nMidnight however, raised doubt about these theories. This was mainly due to Tregga's reputation of using brain implants which were known to calculate probabilities incorrectly, to the point that gamblers at the Lodge had come to anticipate it every time he was seen, despite Tregga being unaware of this particular blind spot.\nTregga first appeared in the 2018 Anthology film, Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
