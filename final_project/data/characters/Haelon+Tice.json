 "content": "Haelon Tice was a Human male bounty hunter and comrade of R'Kayza. Yin Vocta performed numerous cybernetic enhancements on Tice turning the already dangerous man into the perfect cybernetic assassin.\nHaelon was a brutal man with no remorse. He was ill-mannered, violent, and cruel as well. He would stop at nothing to eliminate his target despite overwhelming odds or potential collateral damage. Physically, he had a muscular build that was a mixture of flesh and plasteel. He was not very intelligent despite his extensive modifications.\nAs a cybernetic assassin Haelon was an extremely potent combatant who was able to single-handedly engage speeders, space transports and even light armored vehicles and win. He was incredibly skilled with all forms of combat, specializing in blasters and brawling. In addition he was adept at spotting targets hidden in shadows, had law enforcement training, and was a competent pilot.\nHaelon Tice was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. He was illustrated by Brian Schomburg.",
