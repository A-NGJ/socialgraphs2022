 "content": "A human male child was the village chief of a village located on the planet Genbara in the Outer Rim Territories. The village was attacked by Sith bandits approximately two decades after the Sith rebellion against the Empire.\nThe bandits, led by Kouru, sought to pillage the village, but were defeated by village guards and a former Sith known only as the Ronin. After killing the Bandit Leader, Ronin retrieved the kyber crystal from her lightsaber and gave it to the child village chief, saying it would ward off evil.\nThe character credited as \"Child Village Chief\" appeared in \"The Duel,\" a short film in the Star Wars: Visions series produced by Kamikaze Douga and directed by Takanobu Mizuno. Yuuko Sanpei voiced the character in Japanese, while the English dub was voiced by Jaden Waldman.",
