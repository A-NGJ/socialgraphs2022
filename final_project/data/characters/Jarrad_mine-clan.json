 "content": "The Jarrad mine-clan was a family living on Averill. For generations, the independent mine-clan worked hard in difficult conditions to mine quadrenium ore. Once the Galactic Empire arrived and monopolized the sales of the ore, the Jarrad mine-clan's fortunes changed since the Empire paid less for the ore. Less prosperous, the mine-clan could not afford to purchase more drilling droids, leading to a mining accident that crippled Selby Jarrad's father. Jarrad saw the oppressiveness of the Empire, and attempted to start a rebellion with her cousin who had returned to the minehold. Her cousin was an Alliance Intelligence agent charged with organizing resistance, and when the attempt failed, Jarrad left Averill with him.",
