 "content": "Tiree was a young Human male starfighter pilot in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, he flew in Gold Squadron as Gold Two on Gold Leader Jon Vander's wing in the Battle of Yavin, where he was the first of his wingmates to be shot down by Darth Vader.\nA young Rebel pilot, Tiree was well noted for participating in a raid on Corellia, where, flying a BTL Y-wing starfighter as Gold Two, he helped save engineers who proved invaluable to the Rebellion.\nLater in the Galactic Civil War, during the Battle of Yavin, Tiree flew with the Alliance's Gold Squadron, once again using the call sign Gold Two, and piloting a Y-wing with custom high-power lateral thrusters, allowing the starfighter to better draw and evade enemy fire.\nTiree flew alongside Gold Five Davish \"Pops\" Krail, providing defensive cover to Gold Leader Jon \"Dutch\" Vander in the Rebels' first trench run on the Death Star. Tiree followed Vander's order to transfer all power to his Y-wing's front deflector screen as a defense against the space station's turbolaser turrets, which Tiree described as \"a little aggressive\". Locking his targeting computer and receiving a signal for the coming attack on the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, Tiree observed that the turbolasers had suddenly ceased firing, as three enemy fighters, lead by Darth Vader, entered the trench. Tiree was quickly shot down and killed when Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1 struck his Y-wings's engines, causing an electrical explosion in the cockpit before his fighter was engulfed in flame. Remembered by Princess Leia Organa as a good man, Tiree was joined shortly by his wingmates.\nTiree was played by Jeremy Sinden in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\nAlthough Gold Five identifies his wingmate as Tiree in A New Hope, it is unclear whether the name refers to Gold Two or Gold Leader. The pilot known as Gold Two was first connected to the name Tiree in 1984's A Guide to the Star Wars Universe.\nThe novelization of A New Hope identifies Tiree's squadron as Red Squadron, and Tiree as Red Two.\nTiree's helmet prop — or one of a matching design — was later worn by Habeer Zignean in The Empire Strikes Back.",
