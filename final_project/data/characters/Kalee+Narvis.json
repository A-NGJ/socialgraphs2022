 "content": "Kalee Narvis was a female Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nKalee was the daughter of Jarl Narvis and Gille Narvis, the owners of the company Legal Arms Ltd. During the Clone Wars, Kalee traveled with the company's freighter Aggressive Negotiation to the Cularin system, where it was going to deliver weapons to the Cularin Militia. However, before it could do so, it was boarded by members of the Thaereian military, who murdered most of the crew, including Kalee's father. Kalee and Gille were the only crewmembers left alive, as the Thaereians were called away before they could finish them off. The Negotiation was left dead in space, but the Heroes of Cularin soon arrived and rescued Kalee and Gille.",
