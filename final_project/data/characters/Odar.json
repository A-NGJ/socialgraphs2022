 "content": "Odar was a Human male who lived on Ord Mantell during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Odar was present in Oradam when the village was ransacked by Mantellian soldiers who stole his belongings and arrested his daughter, Qo'el for her suspected ties to the Mantellian Separatist Movement. Odar didn't know why his possessions were seized nor why his daughter was taken, but he desperately wanted Qo'el returned to him. He asked a passing Republic spacer to search for Qo'el in Fort Garnik. The spacer released his daughter from imprisonment and returned her to Odar.",
