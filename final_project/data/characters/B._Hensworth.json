 "content": "Lieutenant B. Hensworth was a member of the Imperial Army who worked with Magister of Trade Sinya Deboora after the Galactic Civil War. Following the overthrowing of Imperial forces on the planet Seltos, and the established of a pro-New Republic government, the pair sought to return the planet to Imperial control. Going into hiding at a secret Imperial base west of Sommin City, Hensworth was still able to maintain contact with Deboora by promising her the Governorship if they regained control of the planet. However, when the New Republic began Operation Freedom Strike Seltos, an effort to locate a spy within the new government's ranks, their plot was thwarted.",
