 "content": "The grandfather of Tula Markona was a human male who Tula described as a \"roguish stranger\". He met a Jedi who fell in love with him, leaving the Jedi Order to settle on Hubin. They eventually had a son, and both taught him everything they knew, though Tula's grandmother looked down on some of her husband's teachings. When both parents died, they were buried on the family plot near their mansion.",
