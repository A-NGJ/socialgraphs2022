 "content": "Fasha Dansun was a xenoarchaeologist who spent several years studying the cultures of the Kathol sector before crossing the Marcol Void and heading into the Kathol Outback. She ran into the Qektoth Confederation, and was captured. Taken to their research station in the Qu'mock system, she was the subject of experiments until rescued by the crew of the New Republic ship FarStar. After her rescue, she signed on with the crew of the FarStar.\nIn 8 ABY, Dansun was in her early thirties, with shoulder-length blonde hair, age lines at the eyes, freckles, and a complexion that showed that she spent a large amount of her time in the open.",
