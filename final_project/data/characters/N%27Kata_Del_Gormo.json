 "content": "N'Kata Del Gormo was a Force-sensitive male Hysalrian Jedi Master who lived during the times of the Galactic Republic. According to legend, he found and trained Yoda and a Force-sensitive Human friend.\nA Force-sensitive Hysalrian, N'Kata Del Gormo was trained in the ways of the Force and achieved the rank of Master within the Jedi Order. The four limbed, serpentine Jedi also had crafted a staff imbued with a large crystal at its summit. According to legend, N'Kata Del Gormo was residing on a swamp world when two visitors crossed his path. A young hermit named Yoda and a Human friend had crash landed on the world and came to Del Gormo for assistance. After a couple of days, Master Del Gormo met with the duo and informed them that they were in fact Force-sensitive; offering to train them as his Padawans.\nThe legend continues that sometime later, a Galactic Republic starship landed on the planet, answering the distress call that had been sent from Yoda's ship before the crash. Departing the world, Yoda would go to Coruscant where he would continue his training at the Jedi Temple, eventually ascending to the rank of Grand Master. If those events did happen, their exact dates were lost during the Great Jedi Purge, when the self-anointed Emperor Palpatine exterminated the Jedi Order.\nAlthough N'Kata Del Gormo went about mostly unclothed, he still wore a leather harness made of two straps that crossed his upper torso. He also had an utility belt with a large pouch on either side, and wore ornamental vambraces on each of his four wrists. He was also known for wielding a long, twisted staff crowned with a crystalline prism.\nN'Kata Del Gormo was created by Chuck Hamilton, a Star Wars fan, for the backstory of his Hysalrian entry in the Design An Alien contest held in the Star Wars Galaxy Magazine. Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, established that the character was part of continuity except for his time on Dagobah, on the StarWars.com Message Boards in 2006. He later explained that Del Gormo's backstory as the Jedi Master of Yoda is regarded as an in-universe legend in a 2013 Twitter post.",
