 "content": "Kargrek was a Felucian, who lived during the early months of the Galactic Empire.\nKargrek lived on the planet Felucia, but was captured by the Imperial Captain Vischera and taken to an Imperial prison. Vischera changed Kargrek's gentic code, making the Felucian larger, more violent and fully obedient to the Captain. Vischera oversaw the combat training of Kargrek and Hagark, another similarly altered Felucian, eventually making them his personal bodyguards. When Vischera attacked a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents that had infiltrated the prison, Kargrek and Hagark accompanied him.",
