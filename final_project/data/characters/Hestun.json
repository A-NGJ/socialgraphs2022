 "content": "Hestun was a Human male admiral of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nDuring the battle of Corellia, Hestun enlisted the help of an Imperial hero to target the Republic's anti-air defenses so that his fleet could bombard the emplacements in Coronet City's Government District. The Admiral was not permitted to bomb the entire sectorâ€”the Emperor himself wanted the Legislature intact. The hero was successful and Hestun's men accurately targeted the emplacements, but the Republic retained a foothold in the Drall Library despite their loss.",
