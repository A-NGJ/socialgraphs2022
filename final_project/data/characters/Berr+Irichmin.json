 "content": "Berr Irichmin was a male Nautolan Jedi Master who lived during the Galactic War. Around 3642 BBY, he resided on Taris and was in the last stand the Galactic Republic made in Olaris, until he was defeated by an Imperial individual.\nBerr Irichmin appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Taris. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by any Imperial character as part of the achievement \"Tyrant of Taris\". This articles assumes 100% game completion, which means Berr Irichmin was killed.",
