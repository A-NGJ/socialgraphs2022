 "content": "Bortis was a Taurill. In 22 BBY, Bortis showed the ability to play the sport of Greenputt with some degree of skill. As Taurills were classified as a non-sentient species, the discovery that Bortis could play Greenputt, coupled with a group of three non-sentient neeks also managing to play the game, lead to the establishment of the Non-Sentient Professional Greenputt Tour to accommodate the new players.",
