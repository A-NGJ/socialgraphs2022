 "content": "Horvic was an Imperial Intelligence agent who was part of the \"Vengeance\" cell during the Caamas Document crisis of 19 ABY.\nUnder Drend Navett's leadership, he participated in an anti-Bothan terrorist campaign of sabotage and riots calculated to increase tensions within the New Republic.\nOn his final mission, he and the rest of Navett's cell were sent to Bothawui to sabotage the planetary shield generators in the planetary capital, Drev'starn. While Navett and Klif opened a pet store as a cover, Pensin and Horvic found work at a Ho'Din restaurant. Using this cover, they had access to a power conduit near the generators, which Navett used as part of his plan to send baby mawkrens with explosives strapped to their backs into the generator buildings.\nWhile Navett took control of this part of the plan, he accompanied Horvic and Klif on a mission to infiltrate the Ishori cruiser Predominance posing as maintenance workers. Once Navett succeeded in taking the planetary shields down, the three agents killed their Ishori escorts, seized control of a weapons turret, and began the bombardment of Drev'starn, setting off a battle at Bothawui. They fired eight shots at the defenseless city before being neutralized.",
