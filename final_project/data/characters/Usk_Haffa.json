 "content": "Usk Haffa was a Bivall male property magnate who was the largest real-estate owner on the world Protobranch during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. At some point, Haffa accompanied the liner Salin Mariner on a luxury cruise. During the voyage, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka attempted to kidnap several high-profile passengers aboard the vessel, by staging an explosion aboard the ship and then trying to deceive his targets into accompanying him into an escape pod. However, Haffa and the Siniteen entrepreneur Sibs Monchan refused to enter the pod, believing that it would be safer to remain aboard the liner.",
