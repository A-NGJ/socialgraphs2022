 "content": "Revidjasa was a male Rodian present in Jabba's Palace in 4 ABY.\nRevidjasa was a Mid Rim crimelord finding success in slaving and extortion before being noticed by Jabba the Hutt, who eliminated the Rodian's inner circle until only Revidjasa remained. Under threat of being removed from power, he was forced to work under Jabba's rules and hated the Hutt for it.\nThe Rodians Revidjasa and Beedo were occupied at a pair of slot machines when C-3PO and R2-D2 arrived at Jabba's Palace just before the rescue of Han Solo. Oblivious to the pair's entry, it was not until the R2 unit's holoprojector lit up that the pair turned away to listen to Luke Skywalker's request of an audience with Jabba the Hutt. Later, Revidjasa took to a shadowed alcove, in the company of Bib Fortuna and Jess, while watching the Max Rebo Band's performance of Jedi Rocks. Beedo meanwhile, danced alongside a Jawa.\nFollowing Jabba's death, Revidjasa made key alliances with Zygerrian and Thalassian cartels, effectively taking over Jabba's slaving operations in the Mid Rim. He was believed to be on his way to becoming a permanent fixture in that region during the struggle between the Empire and the New Republic.\nSome time following the death of Jabba, Revidjasa's left arm was replaced by an undisguised cybernetic one, which proved to be an advantage in physical fighting.",
