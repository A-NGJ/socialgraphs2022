 "content": "Major Symes was a human officer serving in the Galactic Empire carrying the rank of major in the Imperial Army. This parent of Pandak Symes, married to Colonel Symes, had great expectations for their son, Pandak Symes, who attended the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal. Pandak felt that they would be disappointed when he inevitably washed out, which did happen when he was unable to measure up to the rigorous requirements of basic training.\nPandak Syme's parents were mentioned briefly in Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks, but it was unspecified which parent was the mother and which was the father, only that they held the ranks of major and colonel.",
