 "content": "Big String was a male amphibious alien who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire as a crime boss in a fortress he constructed on the Inner Rim planet Amethia Prime. Some time later, an individual hired Chanath Cha, a bounty hunter, to destroy Big String's fortress and apprehend the crime boss. Cha did, and Big String was forced to flee. Cha caught up with him, however, and grabbed onto him and flew to cloud-level. Cha received a call from Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine, so she dropped Big String from the tremendous height.\nBig String was a male amphibious alien who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He worked as a crime boss, engaging in various nefarious activities, which gained him a fortune in credits. String constructed a fortress on the Inner Rim world Amethia Prime in a purple ocean which was located on a series of small volcanic islands. He built the fortress over the span of twenty cycles. He employed many beings who worked in the fortress, including at least three bodyguards. However, some time after the Battle of Yavin, an individual who disliked String hired prestigious bounty hunter Chanath Cha to destroy Big String's \"empire\" and capture the crime boss.\nSoon thereafter, Cha invaded the fortress, killing the majority of String's employees, and utilized her armor and rocket boots to wreak havoc on the fortress. String fled in a boat with three of his guards to escape Cha. As they skimmed across the water, the fortress exploded completely, wiping out String's \"empire\". One of the guards then inquired as to whether String wanted to return to the fortress to search for survivors, to which String replied: \"Don't be and idiot. Drive.\" Cha appeared next to the boat underwater, keeping speed with her rocket boots.\nBefore String could do anything, Cha shot up through the bow of the boat; overturning it, destroying its engine and throwing String and his guards into the water. They scrambled back onto the boat and Cha introduced herself to the crime boss and quickly overtook the three guards in hand-to-hand combat. String, realizing he had little choice, surrendered to the bounty hunter and dropped his blaster rifle. Cha hoisted String up by his belt and ascended to cloud-level of Amenthia Prime's atmosphere, where String pleaded with Cha that he could pay her more than she was being paid in exchange for his freedom, but Cha had none of it and soon received a comlink call from Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine—the most recognizable man in the galaxy—who had a job for the bounty hunter. Therefore, Cha apologized to String and dropped him; not wanting to waste the Emperor's time.\nBig String was a male crime lord of an unidentified amphibian species. He had green skin, green eyes, a pudgy physique. He built a fortress on the oceanic world of Amethia Prime, which became the headquarters of his empire. During the Age of the Empire, String incurred the wrath of an unidentified individual who hired the bounty hunter Chanath Cha to destroy his operations. String was able to wield a blaster but could not swim. He feared Cha and accepted defeated following a prolonged pursuit and skirmish. However, Cha dropped him into the ocean after she received a new assignment from Emperor Palpatine.\nBig String first appeared as a minor antagonist in the 2015 Marvel Comics story Star Wars: Lando. He was written by Charles Soule, drawn by Alex Maleev, and colored by Paul Mounts.",
