 "content": "Elegos A'Kla was a male Caamasi Senator of the New Republic who played a substantial role in the resolution of the Caamas dispute and the peace process initiated by Gilad Pellaeon that resulted in the Bastion Accords.\nElegos was born on Caamas in the Kla Clan. Prior to his role in the Senate, Elegos served as the Trustant of the Morymento Caamasi Remnant. During a pirate raid on his colony, he became caught up in a conflict between a pirate and Corran Horn, who was working undercover in the pirate organization in order to locate his wife Mirax. Corran saved Elegos' life, and in return Elegos masqueraded as Corran's manservant to protect his cover story for saving the Caamasi. Elegos' uncle turned out to be Ylenic It'kla, a friend of Corran's grandfather, Nejaa Halcyon and another Jedi.\nElegos was instrumental in aiding Corran in his path to become a Jedi, find his wife, and fight the Jensaarai with Luke Skywalker. After subduing the Jensaari, Elegos shared a vision of his uncle and Corran's grandfather fighting the Jensaarai leaders. The vision helped heal the hate the Jensaari had for Corran.\nElegos continued to aid the New Republic, helping Leia Organa Solo and her family during the Caamas Document Crisis and was a guest at the wedding of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade, attending alongside Mon Mothma, Talon Karrde and Borsk Fey'lya.\nBy the time of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Elegos was a New Republic Senator. When Leia Organa Solo came to the Senate as just a consular, to warn the Council of the Yuuzhan Vong, Senator A'Kla was one of the few Senators that had believed her story. He agreed to go with her on a few missions afterward to find facts about the Vong, leading to his self appointed mission.\nIn the early months of the Yuuzhan Vong War, A'Kla traveled to Vong held space and surrendered. He attempted to negotiate with the Yuuzhan Vong to gain an understanding of their species and seek a peaceful resolution. A'Kla was aware of the risks involved to his life and health , but believed he had to try regardless. He came to understand the Yuuzhan Vong and their ways, learning about how pain and death were central to the Yuuzhan Vong's lifeâ€”the hard way. Fortunately, A'Kla's pain tolerance threshold was sufficient to keep him from breaking down.\nShedao Shai often talked to Elegos, and they learned much from each other. However, to prove a point to Corran Horn, Shai murdered A'Kla to show the Jedi how to 'properly' deal with the dead. Shai stated in a message to Horn that A'Kla's eyes showed shock at his betrayal, but understanding at the necessity of his death. His skeleton was fitted with jewels, as well as platinum and gold coating, and was sent to Corran Horn, who had accidentally desecrated the remains of one of Shai's ancestors on Bimmiel.\nElegos was survived by his daughter, Releqy A'Kla, and had a Star Destroyer named after him, which fought in Operation Safe Passage under Garm Bel Iblis' command and in the Swarm War.\nAlthough The New Jedi Order Sourcebook shows him with gray hair and yellow eyes, the books describe him as having golden hair and violet eyes, as correctly depicted in the comic Star Wars: Union.",
