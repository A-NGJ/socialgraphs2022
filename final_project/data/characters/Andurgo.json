 "content": "Andurgo was a male Dug pilot who left Malastare and served the Galactic Alliance Remnant in 137 ABY. He was a member of Rogue Squadron and wingmate to Monia Gahan, and he considered himself the finest pilot of the squadron.\nAndurgo, a Dug male, was a pilot in the Galactic Alliance Remnant's elite Rogue Squadron in 137 ABY. In that year, he welcomed the newest Rogue, former stormtrooper Hondo Karr, to the squadron in what he considered the most hilarious way possible â€” by riding on him. But Karr refused to be ridden and began a knife fight. However, their fight was cut short by Rogue Leader Jhoram Bey. Karr took the blame for the fight, and by doing so, he earned the respect of Andurgo. They made up by getting drunk.\nAndurgo flew his CF9 Crossfire starfighter in the Battle of Mon Calamari, serving as the wingmate of Ronto. His showboating antics almost got Ronto killed, angering fellow Rogue Anj Dahl. Luckily Ronto managed to eject and was captured by the Empire, but he was later rescued by the Imperial Knights Treis Sinde and Sigel Dare. The Knights' actions planted the seed of an alliance between the Galactic Alliance Remnant and deposed Emperor Roan Fel's Empire-in-exile.\nAndurgo later participated in the Battle of Ralltiir, the first joint fleet action of the burgeoning alliance. Later in the year, when the Rogues were flying a reconnaissance patrol over Imperial-occupied-Dac, they discovered millions of corpses floating on the ocean world's surface. The One Sith had released poisonous viral spores into the seas, enraging Andurgo and prompting him to disobey new Rogue Leader Anj Dahl's commands and attack some nearby Imperial TIE predators. His fellow Rogues swooped in to assist him, and Dahl ignored his insubordination due to the horrifying reality they faced. The Remnant's Admiral Gar Stazi quickly organized a volunteer emergency evac fleet, and the Rogues joined in the evacuation of Dac, which was only able to rescue twenty percent of the planet's population.\nIn 138 ABY, Rogue Squadron participated in the defense of the Jedi's Hidden Temple on Taivas, flying against Skull Squadron. After this, they fought in a massive battle held at Coruscant, and in the skies above the planet, Andurgo was killed by an Annihilator-class starfighter.",
