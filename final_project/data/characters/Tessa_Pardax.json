 "content": "Tessa Pardax was a Human female commodore of the Sith Empire during the third Galactic War.\nPardax was meticulous, calculating, and driven. She was particularly stern with her subordinates. She believed in pure meritocracy, often ignoring or outright refusing commands from powerful Sith she deemed incompetent, which held back her career in the Empire.\nCommodore Pardax first appears as an Alliance Specialist if the player character decides to side with the Sith Empire in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught, joining the Alliance after Bey'wan Aygo's retirement to replace him.",
