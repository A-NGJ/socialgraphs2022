 "content": "Tynial was a Devaronian male who worked in the Pathline Tapcafe, an establishment on the planet Brentaal IV, in 0 ABY. He was an agent for the Rebel Alliance, ready to give a datadisc to a group of Rebel agents when they used the passphrase \"Gruuvan shaal\" while he was working at the Pathline Tapcafe. However, Tynial was arrested along with other non-Humans by the Galactic Empire's Commission for the Preservation of the New Order two days before the Rebels arrived due to his lack of proper identification; another Rebel had to provide the datadisc instead as the Devaronian was still in Imperial detention when the group reached Brentaal.\nTynial was mentioned in \"Raid on Brentaal,\" a roleplaying adventure included in The Far Orbit Project, a campaign book written by Timothy S. O'Brien and published in 1998 as part of West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. The Devaronian's name is only mentioned twice and is inconsistently spelled: as both \"Tynial\" and \"Tynian.\" This article assumes that the spelling used first, \"Tynial,\" is correct.",
