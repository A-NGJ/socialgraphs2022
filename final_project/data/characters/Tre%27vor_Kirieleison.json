 "content": "Tre'vor Kirieleison was a male Weequay pirate living during the Cold War. He became affiliated with the White Maw pirates on Hoth and was killed around 3642 BBY.\nTre'vor Kirieleison appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Hoth. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by characters of both factions for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
