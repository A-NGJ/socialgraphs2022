 "content": "Aramb was a male Gotal Lieutenant in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. In 36 ABY, he was stationed on the Victory I-class Star Destroyer Admiral Ackbar as part of its engineering staff, and had been there for several years.\nWhen the insectoid Killiks expanded into Chiss space, violating the Qoribu Truce, the Galactic Alliance Fifth Fleet blockaded the Utegetu Nebula at the Murgo Choke. The Killiks, under the influence of the Gorog nest, attacked the Fifth Fleet at the Murgo Choke. Aramb was attacked by Gorog assassins trying to infiltrate and capture the Admiral Ackbar; the assassins paralyzed Aramb with their venom. Two other members of the Admiral Ackbar's engineering staff, Captain Urbok and Lieutenant Commander Reo, were killed by the Gorog venom, leaving Ensign Yuul, the only member of the engineering staff who was conscious, to assume command of the engineering section of the starship. Yuul theorized that the Gorog venom was not lethal to Gotals.\nThe battle ultimately culminated in the capture of the Admiral Ackbar. The Chiss Ascendancy, believing the Galactic Alliance had allied with the Killiks, declared war on the Killiks, starting the Swarm War.\nAramb was first mentioned in the 2005 novel Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen, written by Troy Denning. He later received a minor entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008.",
