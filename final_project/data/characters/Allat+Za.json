 "content": "Allat Za was the Chieftain of the Quarren species when the residents of the Quarren homeworld of Dac first encountered the Galactic Republic over 120 years after 4500 BBY. Dac was given the option to join the Republic, which the Mon Calamari, another sentient species from Dac, supported. Za, however, opposed joining the Republic and forced the incumbent Mon Calamari king to instead make Dac an independent state that was allied with the Republic. Za's achievement was viewed as a victory by the Quarren, but they nonetheless began to feel increasingly marginalized by the Mon Calamari as time went on.\nAllat Za was mentioned in the 2015 Star Wars Roleplaying sourcebook Strongholds of Resistance, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game.",
