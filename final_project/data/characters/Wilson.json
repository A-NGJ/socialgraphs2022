 "content": "Wilson was a human male administrator of the Galactic Republic on Coruscant during the High Republic Era. He trained diplomats.\nHe was once enrolled as a cadet at the Carida Military Academy, where he was a senior cadet while future Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee was a first-year. He abused the young Twi'lek, demanding she perform menial tasks for him in the name of his seniority despite her superior aptitude at starfighter maintenance. Dee attacked Wilson's friend Lalutin with a servo driver he had demanded she give him, nearly killing the Selkath cadet. Wilson then engaged Dee in hand-to-hand combat until the Academy's Captain Reese arrived. Dee proceeded to escape aboard a stolen fighter.\nWilson appeared in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast.",
