 "content": "The Great Progenitor was the first of the Drengir, a species of sentient carnivorous plants. After the Drengir were betrayed by the Sith, who they had for a time worked alongside, the Great Progenitor was trapped and forced to sleep aboard the abandoned Amaxine space station. After a group of Jedi and travelers stumbled upon the Drengir on the space station, the Great Progenitor was awoken, leading a number of other Drengir to similarly wake up. She was later defeated by a group of Jedi led by Avar Kriss, in conjunction with the Hutt Cartel. After her defeat, Myarga wanted to kill her, but the Jedi imprisoned her in the Bogan Vault. She died sometime later.\nThe Great Progenitor first appeared, albeit unnamed, in the 2021 young-adult novel The High Republic: Into the Dark, which was written by Claudia Gray. She was later identified and first pictured in a flashback sequence in the fourth issue of the comic series Star Wars: The High Republic, written by Cavan Scott, illustrated by Ario Anindito, and published by Marvel Comics on April 7, 2021.",
