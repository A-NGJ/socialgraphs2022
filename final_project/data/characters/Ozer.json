 "content": "Ozer was a male Human who served as a private in the Galactic Republic's army during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. During the war, he was stationed on the planet Voss where his squad worked with a group of Voss commandos in the Gormak Lands. They were attacked by a cyberbeast after approaching a cave, and all of the Voss and the rest of Ozer's squad were killed. Ozer then encountered a Republic aligned individual who he asked to clear out the cave of cyberbeasts and recover the dog tags of his fallen comrades. The individual succeeded, and Ozer was later rescued.",
