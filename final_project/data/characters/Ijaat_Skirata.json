 "content": "Ijaat Skirata was the middle child and youngest son of the Mandalorian mercenary Kal Skirata, and Ilippi, a non-Mandalorian. He was the brother of Tor Skirata and Ruusaan \"Ruu\" Skirata.\nAlthough he bore a Mandalorian name , Ijaat disowned his father along with Tor.\nYears later, in 20 BBY, Tor contacted Kal, via comlink, to say their sister was in trouble, and when Kal agreed to help, he also said that he and Ijaat were sorry.\nIjaat was described as being two years younger than his brother, Tor Skirata, in Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, which meant that he should be approximately thirty-seven years old during Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel.",
