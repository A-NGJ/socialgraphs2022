 "content": "Thorpell was a male Human who served as a barracks officer within the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. During the war he was stationed in the Republic's secret prison on the planet Belsavis. In the prison he operated a stall in the Prison Command Center of the Minimum Security Section, where he sold armor from a stall to various Republic personnel. He wore a tan uniform and carried a blaster pistol while at his stall. Thorpell had fair skin, ginger hair, and blue eyes.\nBarracks Officer Thorpell appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Armor Vendor for Republic players on Belsavis. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Thorpell was removed from the game along with the rest of the Armor Vendors.",
