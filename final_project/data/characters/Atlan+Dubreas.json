 "content": "Atlan Dubreas was a male Trandoshan elite councilor in the Chirq Council who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Atlan Dubreas was one of the nine elite councilors who led the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council. The eight others were Markus Gilder, Braganti Hooge, Koran Lassk, Janos Zarbo, Mathazar Zayet, Zuld Mar-Shayal, Crale Forte and Rallyn Secura. Dubreas was based in the First Elite Council Bunker, near the city of Doaba Guerfel.\nIn 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Chirq Council following the increase of ryll traffic on Corellia. Captain Vitala Baize decided to infiltrate the organization with a CorSec agent using the identity of Trins Evnar, a Chirq Council member in Doaba Guerfel. After killing Evnar, as well as every other Chirq Council criminals who used to know him, the CorSec agent assumed Trins Evnar's identity towards the underboss Jzoro Quanera and managed to lure him, successfully infiltrating the organization. From Jzoro Quanera's database, the CorSec obtained the identity of the nine elite councilors and the locations of their secret headquarters. The Corsec eventually assaulted the First and Second Elite Council Bunkers and killed all elite councilors during the attack. After the death of Atlan Dubreas and the other elite councilors, the Chirq Council splintered.\nAtlan Dubreas was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Atlan Dubreas was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives,\" published on June 8, 2006.",
