 "content": "Jago was a Human male who served as an agent the Republic Strategic Information Service during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3642 BBY, he went on a mission to recover intel on a satellite system which was stationed on Balmorra. He was able to retrieve the intel from the Balmorran satellite until his ship was shot down by Imperials. Before he was killed, he was able to eject the intel from his ship. Eventually, a Republic individual was able to find his body in the shipwreck and recover all of Jago's intel.\nJago appears in the mission \"From the Wreckage\" for Republic classes in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
