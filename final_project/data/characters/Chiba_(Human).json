 "content": "Chiba was a female Human who lived on the planet Lanteeb during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Republic and the Separatists.\nAround 21 BBY, Chiba and the villagers from Torbel were visited by the Confederacy of Independent Systems under the command of General Lok Durd who was planning to test his new bioweapon. However, when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker arrived to warn the villagers and the miners about the Separatist's plan, Chiba followed their instructions and made the majority of other residents to flee the mine. In the ensuing attack, the entire village was destroyed. After the battle ended, Queen Jamillia offered the people of Torbel sanctuary on Naboo. Agreeing to leave, Chiba and the other survivors were taken off-world and traveled to their new home planet.",
