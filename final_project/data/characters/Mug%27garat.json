 "content": "Mug'garat was a Advozse male criminal who worked for Rogun Matt'rik during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3642 BBY, Mug'garat was sent by Rogun to deal with the smuggler later known as Voidhound who believed that he was helping the Voidwolf. After the King's Ransom was destroyed in orbit above Nar Shaddaa, Mug'garat corned Senator Bevera Dodonna in order to lure Ace into a trap. Hoping that Rogun would be happy that he beat Ace, he and two of his Ssorokks engaged the smuggler, but were all defeated and killed.",
