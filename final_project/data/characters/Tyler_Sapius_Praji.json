 "content": "Tyler Sapius Praji was the Governor of Kaikielius, one of the original Founding Parents of the Galactic Republic in 25,000 BBY, and the progenitor of House Praji.\nTyler Praji was originally the governor and ruler of Kaikielius, then a colony on the Koros Trunk Line at the edge of the Deep Core, which had been established two centuries before the rise of the Republic by an older Core Worlds civilization.\nThough few records concerning his achievements survived to the present day, the achievement that earned him his place in history is that he was one of the signers of the Galactic Constitution, which established the Galactic Republic as a government.\nThis assured Tyler his place in galactic history and established his descendants, the Prajii, as a long-lived aristocratic family that would endure for another twenty-five millennia and beyond. Millennia later, he was commemorated by an abstract statue outside the Senate Building on Coruscant.",
