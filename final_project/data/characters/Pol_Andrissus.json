 "content": "Pol Andrissus was a male human who served as a member of the alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry. He defected from the Galactic Empire as a cadet along with his classmate Carver. He was nicknamed Charmer for his \"good looks\" and reputation for being a \"ladies man\". In a campaign on Blacktar Cyst, he was badly injured which lost him his \"good looks\" and resulted in him developing a stutter.\nFollowing the Battle of Hoth, the 61st initiated Operation Ringbreaker and Charmer was assigned his own squad. He died during the attack on Mardona III, when he attempted to save his squad from an Unidentified armored worm vehicle. Only Corbo made it out. Carver joined the team which went out to avenge him and his two fallen men and were successful catching the crew as they disembarked from the vehicle and destroyed the worm.\nPol Andrissus first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed.",
