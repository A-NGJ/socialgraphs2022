 "content": "Dahl Harris was a Human male who lived as a farmer on Tatooine during the Cold War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Dahl lived in the settlement of Malcolm's Dunes where they were aided by Jedi Master Eriz Vossan to defend themselves from the Sand People. However, when Dahl, Hale Malcolm, Zak Davies, and the farming settlers provided Master Vossan the coordinates of the Sand People's camp, the Jedi Master fell to Lord Vivicar's plague and went insane. This caused him to turn against the settlers as he sent the Tusken warriors to attack the farming settlement. Dahl and the settlers were angry that Vossan betrayed them until they encountered another Jedi, known as the Barsen'thor. They were very aggressive toward the Knight, but the Jedi Consular convinced the farmers to provide Vossan's location.",
