 "content": "A male Human petty officer was a member of the Lost Tribe of Sith from the planet Kesh born sometime before 27.5 ABY. He served under Sith Saber Gavar Khai in the Sith Tribe's armada around 44 ABY. In that year, he traveled with Sith Saber Tola Annax to the planet Nam Chorios, where he took part in an attack on the exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, and the rogue Sith apprentice Vestara Khai. During the fight, he dueled Vestara Khai and was stabbed through the heart.\nA Human male was born on the planet Kesh sometime before 27.5 ABY and was trained by the Lost Tribe of Sith, descendants of a group of Sith who had been stranded on the world thousands of years before. The Human ascended to the rank of Sith Saber and served fellow Saber Gavar Khai as a petty officer in the Lost Tribe's armada. In 44 ABY, the petty officer was part of a Sith task force sent to the planet Nam Chorios to capture or kill Abeloth, a powerful dark side entity.\nDuring the mission, the petty officer, along with two other Sabers, served under the Keshiri Saber Tola Annax. After landing on the world, the officer and his companions ambushed the exiled Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, Skywalker's son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, and the rogue Sith apprentice Vestara Khaiâ€”the daughter of his commanding officer, Gavar Khai. Like the Sith, the Jedi were also searching for Abeloth. Near the town of Kesla Vein, the three Human Sabers engaged their opponents in lightsaber combat, although Annax stayed behind. The petty officer dueled Vestara Khai and was able to gain the upper hand in the combat. However, when he used the Force to throw some stones at her, the younger Sith kicked one of the stones in the direction of the Saber's face. When the petty officer tried to block the attack, Vestara stabbed the Sith through his heart, killing him instantly.\nThe Sith was in good physical condition during the mission on Nam Chorios, and he had an athletic and solid build. He was able to reach the rank of Sith Saber in the Tribe, and he wore the standard attire for settlers on Nam Chorios during his mission there. While dueling Vestara, he had no qualms about using the Force, even though doing so had catastrophic consequences for the planet, as the tsil crystals on Nam Chorios greatly boosted and redirected the Force energy. During the duel, he used a red-bladed lightsaber.\nWhen combating Vestara Khai, the younger Sith recognized that her opponent had no grace in his actions and instead attacked like a tank. The Sith was able to levitate stones by using the Force and attack Vestara with them. However, the younger Sith was able to surprise her opponent and kill him after a short fight.\nThe petty officer appeared in Fate of the Jedi: Conviction, the seventh novel of the Fate of the Jedi series. Conviction was written by author Aaron Allston and was published in May 24, 2011.",
