 "content": "Hellene was a Twi'lek female who worked as a barkeeper at Kala'uun. She had a thing for starship captains and as such, at some point prior to the destruction of the planet Alderaan, she fell for the charms of Han Solo, Captain of the Millennium Falcon. Solo thought of her while trying to remember the name of Jenny, a girl he spent time with while in Mos Eisley spaceport on the planet Tatooine.\nHellene was first mentioned in A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, a canon novelization of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope written by Alexandra Bracken and released in 2015. She receives no mention in the film itself.",
