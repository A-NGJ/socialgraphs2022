 "content": "A Scofti male served as the Prefect of the Scoftic government, ruling over the Unknown Regions planet Bardram Scoft. Several years before 19 BBY during his term as Prefect, he was assassinated, leading to a new government and new protocols. The Scofti's murder did not cause much uproar within the Scofti as it was common for coup d'etats to happen in the Scofti government.\nFollowing the new government's appointment, numerous nearby societies sent diplomats to Bardram Scoft, including the Chiss Ascendancy, as they needed to learn the new Prefect's protocols. Upon hearing the news from the Chiss Junior Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo, the Pathfinder navigator Qilori, who guided the starship carrying the Chiss ambassador and the Junior Commander to Bardram Scoft, was shocked by the Prefect's death and the lack of distress among the Scofti.",
