 "content": "Tannac was a Human male Sith Inquisitor of the resurgent Sith Empire. He was a mysterious Child of the Emperor that appeared on Voss at the time that Kira Carsen and her Master spoke with Suri, Kira's childhood friend. They tried to convince her to come to Tython to help her overcome the voice of the Sith Emperor in her head. In that moment, Tannac arrived with another Child of the Emperor, explaining that only he and his brethren were able to help Suri. After some thinking, Kira and the Hero let Suri go with Tannac. During the final confrontation with Tenebrae, Tannac was among the spirits that were summoned to witness his defeat.\nThe Hero has the option to fight with Tannac and his followers and kill them, which means he is also forced to defeat Suri.",
