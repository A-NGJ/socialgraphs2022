 "content": "The Fetts were a family consisting of the bounty hunters Jango Fett and Boba Fett. Jango's homeworld was the Mandalorian planet Concord Dawn. Raised by a mentor during his time as a foundling after losing his parents, Jango fought in the Mandalorian Civil Wars. Ultimately, however, he pursued the career of a bounty hunter, utilizing his combat skills to acquire wealth in credits. As a mercenary, Jango wore a suit of Mandalorian armor made from beskar.\nThe Sith hired Jango to serve as the clone template for the Grand Army of the Republic, an army secretly created on Kamino during the final years of the Republic Era. As a result, the genetically identical clone troopers were modeled on Jango's DNA. In addition, the Kaminoan cloners created Alpha and Omega, both of whom possessed pure first generation Fett blood. Jango raised Alpha as his son, giving him the name of \"Boba Fett,\" while the female clone known as Omega was raised for a time by Doctor Nala Se.\nDiscovered by the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Fetts retreated to Geonosis where Jango was killed in battle by Jedi Master Mace Windu. At first, Boba sought to avenge his father by assassinating Windu, but later shifted his attention to becoming a bounty hunter. The rest of Jango's clones formed the backbone of the Galactic Republic's new military, and the conflict that engulfed the galaxy—the Clone Wars—was named after them. Although they were loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Generals who served alongside them, the clones were programmed to comply with Order 66, a secret directive to exterminate the members of the Jedi Order. With the fall of the Jedi and the support of the clone army, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious claimed the title of Galactic Emperor, reorganizing the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\nWhile the clones were supplanted by natural-born stormtroopers, Boba became a renowned bounty hunter whose clients included the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel smuggler Han Solo inadvertently caused Boba to fall into the Great Pit of Carkoon. Although Boba survived the sarlacc that devoured him, his armor fell into the possession of Jawa scavengers who later sold it to Cobb Vanth. The armor was taken from Vanth by the Mandalorian warrior Din Djarin, leading to a confrontation on Tython with Boba who sought to regain his father's armor. Djarin acknowledged Boba's claim on the armor, although Bo-Katan Kryze denounced Boba as a clone rather than a Mandalorian or a true son of Jango. After aiding Djarin in his efforts to rescue the Force-sensitive foundling Grogu, Boba and Fennec Shand seized control of Jabba's Palace, killing Bib Fortuna in the process. Boba then claimed Jabba's throne, with Shand by his side. They went on to form the Fett gotra, a criminal organization centered in the port city of Mos Espa where they would enter into a conflict with the Spice cartel known as the Pyke Syndicate over the control of the city.\nThe Fetts traced their origins to the Mandalorians, a clan-based cultural group that originated from the planet Mandalore. Jango Fett's homeworld of Concord Dawn was located in the Mandalore sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Because his parents were murdered, Fett was raised as a foundling by the Mandalorians, and he was given a suit of Mandalorian armor and ultimately fought in the Mandalorian Civil Wars.\nAs a bounty hunter, Jango's Mandalorian armor gave him an advantage over his opponents, particularly in aerial combat due to his jetpack. By the time of the late Republic Era, he had gained notoriety as the best mercenary in the galaxy. Although Jango had been a foundling, the New Mandalorians disavowed any connection between Jango and Mandalorian society. Prime Minister Almec, the head of Duchess Satine Kryze's government on Mandalore, dismissed Jango as a common bounty hunter who simply wore the armor of a Mandalorian warrior.\nIn the aftermath of the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus approached Jango Fett on the Moons of Bogden. Acting on the Kaminoan government's behalf, Tyranus offered Jango a considerable amount of credits in exchange for regular access to his genetic material, having chosen a human mercenary with a reputation for skill and discretion as the clone template for the Grand Army of the Republic. Jango ultimately accepted Tyranus' proposition and was cloned on the extragalactic world of Kamino. Using Jango's DNA as a blueprint, Kaminoan scientists created the first generation of clone troopers.\nDue to their genetic modifications, the clone troopers were engineered to grow at twice the rate of normal human aging, which allowed the Kaminoans to grow battalions of battle-ready troops within a standard decade instead of the lifetime that it would have taken without the use of growth acceleration. Furthermore, Jango's clones were mentally conditioned to be more docile than their progenitor, making them compliant to following orders. Nevertheless, they were still capable of creative thinking, which, according to Lama Su, made clones far superior to droids. However, some clones were less susceptible to psychological conditioning, and therefore, more independent than most of their brethren. Cut Lawquane was one such clone; disillusioned by the purpose of his creation, he became a deserter and started a family of his own by marrying the Twi'lek female Suu Lawquane.\nThe clones were bred to serve as soldiers of the Galactic Republic; unknown to the clones, however, they were purpose-built for the systematic destruction of the Jedi Order, the Sith having programmed the clones to terminate the Jedi for treason in accordance with Order 66. To that end, the Sith designed behavioral modification biochips to ensure the clones' compliance. Believing the biochips acted as a contingency against betrayal from rogue Jedi, the Kaminoans implanted the device in the brain of every clone trooper at the earliest stage of their development.\nJango remained on Kamino for several years, residing in Tipoca City where he observed the clone cadets who trained to become soldiers. While the Kaminoans such as Prime Minister Lama Su and Taun We reveled in the success of their creations, regarding the Fett clones as a testament to their skills in cloning, Jango dismissed his duplicates as \"livestock\" bred to be \"cannon fodder.\"\nWithin the cloning facility of Tipoca City alone, over a million clones of Jango Fett comprised the first generation of the clone army, while millions more were bred in other facilities located throughout Kamino. Clone Captain CT-7567, commanding officer of the 501st Legion's Torrent Company, was a first-generation clone. Unlike the clone troopers who were genetically modified, two clones of Jango Fett—designated as Alpha and Omega—were created through pure genetic replication, and therefore possessed Jango's DNA in its purest form. Whereas Alpha and the clone troopers were biologically male like their template, Omega was a female clone.\nTaking no pride in the clones that would form the backbone of the Republic Military, Jango became invested in Alpha, the unaltered clone that he specifically requested as part of his payment. Adopting the name \"Boba Fett,\" he was regarded as a son by Jango. Boba, in turn, considered Jango as his father. The Fetts were able to communicate with each other in their own language, which was known as the Fett Code.\nJango's training shaped Boba into a lethal combatant; as a youngling, Boba was more skilled in marksmanship than most beings in the galaxy. He learned the art of combat while accompanying Jango on his assignments as a bounty hunter. One such mission occurred on Ord Mantell, where the Jango and Boba worked with the mercenaries Neelda, Rinn, and Tiver. The Fetts were ultimately betrayed by Rinn and Tiver, taking Boba as a hostage. However, they were both killed by the clone after Jango declined to interfere, having chosen to use the situation to test Boba. Although Boba based his actions according to what he believed Jango would have done in his position, Jango saw potential in his son and expressed pride as a father.\nIn 22 BBY, during the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Jango Fett was hired by Viceroy Nute Gunray to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. The plot was foiled by the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, resulting in the capture of Jango's partner Zam Wesell. Jango attempted to hide his involvement in the attempt on Amidala's life by killing Wesell with a Kamino saberdart. However, Kenobi successfully tracked the bounty hunter by investigating the saberdart that killed Jango's Clawdite partner. He subsequently discovered both the clone army and its template during his visit to Kamino, and was instructed by the Jedi High Council to bring Jango to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for interrogation.\nThe Fetts were in the process of leaving Kamino by the time Kenobi confronted them after reporting to the High Council. Jango fought Kenobi while Boba prepared their personal starship, Slave I, for departure. Although they ultimately escaped after Boba almost killed Kenobi with Slave I's heavy weapons, Kenobi pursued the Fetts from Kamino to Geonosis where he discovered the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Separatists captured Kenobi, who was sentenced to die alongside Skywalker and Amidala in the Petranaki Arena. The first battle of the Clone Wars commenced between battle droids and the Jedi assault team that infiltrated the Separatist stronghold to rescue Kenobi. Jango confronted Jedi Master Mace Windu, an expert in lightsaber combat, while defending his benefactor Count Dooku. Windu ultimately prevailed in the contest, using his amethyst-bladed lightsaber to decapitate the bounty hunter shortly before the arrival of the clone troopers.\nBoba Fett, orphaned as a child, spent his adolescence in the galaxy's criminal underworld. He joined a group of mercenaries led by the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, who became a mentor to the orphaned clone of Jango Fett. Sing raised Boba to become a bounty hunter as well, teaching him the skills of her trade while also trying to impart her ruthlessness to her ward.\nShocked by Jango's swift death on Geonosis, Boba became obsessed with seeking revenge against the Jedi who killed his father. By then, Windu was a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, giving him the authority to command the clone troopers alongside the other Jedi. Intent on collecting the bounties placed on the Jedi by the Separatists, Sing became Boba's accomplice in his plan to assassinate Windu.\nIn 21 BBY, Boba joined a brigade of clone cadets, the Clone Youth Brigade, in order to infiltrate Windu's command ship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance where he bombed the general's quarters. The assassination attempt failed, however, causing Boba to sabotage the Endurance. He used an escape pod to leave the Star Destroyer as it crashed on Vanqor, and was rescued by his accomplices Sing, Bossk, and Castas. Sing, having stressed the necessity for ruthlessness in Boba's training as a bounty hunter, urged him to kill the cadets who fled the Endurance with him. Although Boba was a bounty hunter, he was not as ruthless as his mentor. As such, he refused to kill the cadets who looked like his twins. While he did not consider himself a clone like the troopers who served the Jedi and the Republic, they were nonetheless his genetic duplicates.\nThe bounty hunters traveled to Vanqor where Boba planted a bomb in the Endurance's bridge. The bomb was planted in Jango's helmet, which Anakin Skywalker inadvertently activated. Windu saved Skywalker's life using the Force to pull the other Jedi away from the trap, although the explosion caused greater damage to the Endurance, trapping Windu and Skywalker beneath the wreckage of the starship. Boba and his accomplices searched the Endurance in order to confirm Windu's death, but were distracted by Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, who deceived the bounty hunters into believing that Windu escaped from Vanqor. The mercenaries regrouped elsewhere, unaware that Windu was still on the Endurance, taking several hostages with them.\nWindu inspected the damaged Mandalorian helmet while waiting for Skywalker's droid to rescue them, and realized that the culprit was Boba. They had learned of Boba through Kenobi's report from Kamino, and knew that he was a clone whom Jango regarded as a son. Windu revealed to Skywalker that Boba witnessed his killing of Jango on Geonosis. Both Jedi were ultimately rescued by the Wolfpack, a clone trooper squad led by Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano, R2-D2 having reached the Jedi temple on Coruscant. Despite Skywalker's insistence on capturing Boba, Windu chose to remain focused on the war effort, not wishing to be further distracted by Boba's personal vendetta.\nBoba and Sing sent a transmission to Windu while he recovered at the Jedi Temple, revealing the prisoners that they captured on Vanqor. The holographic recording showed the execution of Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds,\" whom Sing personally killed after Boba hesitated. The bounty hunter warned the Jedi that she would kill the other of the captives, including Admiral Shoan Kilian, if Windu did not confront Boba. Ponds' body was then ejected from Slave I and left to drift in space; Sing chastised Boba for not killing the clone trooper officer, warning him not to hesitate.\nWith Windu and Skywalker still incapacitated due to their injuries, Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon tracked the bounty hunters to a priate lair on the planet Florrum. Sing fled from the Jedi, leaving Boba to be captured. In spite of Sing's efforts to instill ruthlessness in him, Boba was shocked by his mentor's willingness to leave him behind. Defeated and captured, he was initially uncooperative with the Jedi until the leader of the Ohnaka Gang, Hondo Ohnaka, convinced Boba that saving the hostages was an honorable choice that Jango would have supported. Charged with the destruction of the Endurance, attempted assassination, and taking hostages, Boba was imprisoned in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center on Coruscant. He did not regret his actions and continued to hold a vendetta against Windu.\nKrayt's Claw, a syndicate of bounty hunters based on Tatooine, was formed by Boba after his time in prison. In addition to Boba, the group consisted of Bossk, Dengar, C-21 Highsinger, Latts Razzi, and Asajj Ventress. Unlike the other hunters who deferred to Boba's leadership, Ventress was unenthusiastic about following a child's orders. Boba led the syndicate during an operation on Quarzite. They were hired by the Belugans to deliver Pluma Sodi to Otua Blank, who intended to make Sodi his bride. The Kage Warriors fought against the members of Krayt's Claw while attempting to rescue Sodi before she could be taken to the Belugan dictator, leaving only Boba and Ventress to complete the mission. However, Ventress sympathized with Sodi and allowed her to rejoin the Kage, betraying Boba in the process.\nBy the end of the Clone Wars, the clone troopers had turned against the Jedi who led them throughout the conflict, destroying most of the Order while under the influence of the inhibitor chip that compelled them to comply with Order 66. In the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and the collapse of the Separatist leadership, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the Sith Lord Darth Sidious—was declared the Galactic Emperor, transforming the Republic into the first Galactic Empire in 19 BBY.\nFollowing the Emperor's rise to power, Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin informed the Kaminoan government of the New Order's plan to supplant clones with conscripted soldiers. Prime Minister Lama Su argued that natural-born soldiers were inherently inferior to his clones, who were trained from their creation. The death of Jango Fett, however, left the Kaminoans with a limited supply of his genetic material, which had deteriorated over the course of the Clone Wars. Fearing for the future of Kamino and its operation, Lama Su sought to create a new version of clone troopers by using a fresh source of the Jango Fett genotype. The Prime Minister's contingency relied on two clones, Alpha and Omega, who possessed unmodified first-generation Fett DNA. As neither clone was in their possession by this time, the Kaminoans employed mercenaries to hunt Omega after she escaped from Kamino with the renegade members of Clone Force 99.\nIn spite of Lama Su's efforts to ensure the continuation of the clone trooper program, the Empire decommissioned the cloning facilities across Kamino after canceling its contracts with the Kaminoan government. The final batches of Jango Fett's clones would be activated, but future generations of stormtroopers would consist of human volunteers and conscripts. The first wave of non-clone soldiers were trained by experienced Fett clones, such as Clone Commander CT-9904, who trained a unit of Elite Squad Troopers, as well as the clone commandos who served as instructors at the Imperial Base on Daro.\nUsing the combat and martial skills he learned at a young age, Boba Fett cemented his career as a bounty hunter and was known throughout the galaxy as one of its most lethal mercenaries. The Mandalorian armor that Jango wore during his career as a bounty hunter was inherited by Boba. The armor was customized and damaged over the course of Boba's career, yet remained reminiscent of the design utilized by Jango. Slave I, the modified Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once served as Jango's starship, was also left in Boba's possession.\nAs a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, Boba was often employed as a hired enforcer for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure during the Imperial Era. In addition to working for Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire, Boba accepted contracts from Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith who served as the Emperor's chief enforcer in the Galactic Empire. Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Boba reported the identity of the Rebel pilot who destroyed the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station, Luke Skywalker, to Vader. The Sith Lord who was once Anakin Skywalker realized that Luke was his son.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Vader hired Boba as well as several mercenaries to hunt down a Rebel ship, the Millennium Falcon, that escaped from Imperial forces during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. The ship's pilot, Captain Han Solo, was a smuggler whom Boba encountered during a meeting with Jabba on Tatooine, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. At the time Vader was determined to capture Luke Skywalker, his secret son who aspired to become a Jedi Knight. Aware of Skywalker's friendship with the occupants of the Millennium Falcon, the Sith Lord intended to use them to lure Skywalker out of hiding. Vader therefore informed the bounty hunters that the Rebels they would hunt were to be captured instead of killed, and specifically warned Boba to not disintegrate his targets.\nBoba successfully tracked the Millennium Falcon to the Bespin system, where Solo and his companions sought refuge in Cloud City. As a reward for his role in the capture of Skywalker's friends, Boba was allowed to take Solo to Jabba in order to claim the Hutt's bounty on the smuggler. Although Princess Leia Organa attempted to rescue Solo, who was frozen in carbonite, she was unable to prevent Boba's departure from Bespin.\nBoba transported Solo to Tatooine, where he collected the carbon-frozen smuggler's bounty from Jabba, and resumed his place at the Hutt gangster's side as one of Jabba's most trusted enforcers. Remaining at Jabba's Palace, Boba was present when Organa infiltrated the Hutt stronghold while disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, determined to rescue Solo. She was captured, however, and Jabba sentenced her friends to die in the Great Pit of Carkoon. As the Rebels fought with Jabba's guards in a final attempt at escape, Boba personally confronted Luke Skywalker. He was quickly taken out of the fight by Solo, who accidentally hit Boba's jetpack while still blinded from the side effects of the carbon freezing. The jetpack ignited, causing the bounty hunter to crash against the side of Jabba's sail barge, the Khetanna, before falling into the pit of a \"man-eating\" sarlacc.\nAlthough Boba Fett was rumored to have died, he managed to escape from the sarlacc by burning it from the inside with his armor's flamethrower. A group of Jawas found Boba after he dug his way back to the surface. The scavengers removed Boba's armor while he was injured and unconscious, and left him in the desert where he was discovered by Tusken Raiders. Though initially treated as a prisoner, Boba gradually gained the trust of his captors' chieftain after saving the life of a youngling.\nOver time he learned to communicate in Tusken, as well as how to fight with a gaderffii stick. Boba in turn taught the Tuskens how to operate repulsorcrafts in order to better protect their territory. Using several speeder bikes that Boba confiscated from a gang of Nikto bikers at Tosche Station, the Tuskens raided a Pyke Syndicate repulsortrain as it crossed through the Dune Sea. The hovertrain was derailed during the attack, allowing the Tuskens to seize the train's supplies.\nIn the aftermath of the raid, the chieftain gifted Boba with a lizard that was meant to serve as his guide. The lizard entered Boba's brain through his nostril, causing the clone to hallucinate as he wandered through the Dune Sea in a dream induced state. He saw visions of his childhood on Kamino, as well as his near-death experience in the sarlacc pit, and eventually found a tree in the desert. He used one of its branches to build his own gaderffii stick, which he presented to the members of the Tusken tribe that had taken him in.\nFollowing the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Mandalorian armor that the Jawas took from Boba Fett was in turn sold to Cobb Vanth. During his time as the armor's custodian, Vanth liberated Mos Pelgo and became a marshal. Although the armor had passed into Vanth's possession, Boba was determined to reclaim it. The armor was made from beskar, which the Mandalorians claimed as their property. While Boba did not consider himself a Mandalorian, the armor was gifted to his father, Jango Fett, by the Mandalorians who raised him as a foundling. Therefore, as Jango's son, Boba believed that the armor was his inheritance.\nBoba's armor remained in Vanth's possession for several years during the New Republic Era, which saw the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the New Republic. By 9 ABY, Vanth encountered the Mandalorian warrior Din Djarin who demanded that the marshal relinquish the armor due to the fact that he was not a Mandalorian. Ultimately, they agreed to trade the armor for Djarin's help in killing the krayt dragon that threatened the population of Mos Pelgo. They accomplished their objective with help from the citizens of Mos Pelgo and the Tusken Raiders. With the dragon slain, Boba's armor passed from Vanth to Djarin. As a result though, Djarin was tracked by Boba who was still intent on regaining his armor.\nBoba confronted Djarin on the planet Tython, where the Mandalorian had traveled as part of his quest to reunite the foundling Grogu with the Jedi Order. Aided by Fennec Shand, a bounty hunter whom Boba saved after her near-death experience on Tatooine, Boba attempted to reclaim his armor from Djarin in exchange for the safety of Grogu.\nDjarin rejected Boba's offer, remaining committed to the Mandalorian Creed which prevented him from surrendering the armor and its beskar to a non-Mandalorian. As Boba started to reveal the origins of his father in an effort to persuade Djarin, Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant arrived on Tython with the goal of capturing Grogu. The ensuing skirmish forced Djarin to fight alongside the bounty hunters in order to protect Grogu, giving Boba an opportunity to take his armor from the Mandalorian's ship, the Razor Crest.\nRedonning his armor, Boba killed several stormtroopers on his own while the rest of the troops retreated to the Imperial transports. As the Imperials retreated, Boba launched the missile on his Z-6 jetpack at one of the vessels, resulting in a mid-air collision that destroyed both transports. In the aftermath of the skirmish, Boba used the armor's chain code to support his claim on the armor, revealing that it once belonged to his father. Jango's past as a foundling convinced Djarin to allow Boba to keep the armor. Having guaranteed Grogu's safety in exchange for the armor's return, Boba pledged his service to the Mandalorian's cause until the Child was rescued from Gideon.\nBoba and Djarin traveled to the desert world Lafete seeking the help of Bo-Katan Kryze, the leader of the Mandalorian resistance whom Djarin worked with on the moon Trask. While Kryze acknowledged Djarin—a member of the Children of the Watch—as a fellow Mandalorian, she did not view Boba as such, knowing that he was a clone. She also considered his use of Mandalorian armor disgraceful. Although Boba did not claim to be a Mandalorian, he based his claim on Jango's armor as the son of a foundling. Kryze dismissed Boba's claim due to his origins as a clone and Jango's relation to him as a genetic donor. Nevertheless, Kryze agreed to join their quest in order to confront Gideon and reclaim the Darksaber, an ancient lightsaber that served as a symbol of unity and leadership on Mandalore.\nWith the Mandalorians' support, Djarin's allies executed a plan to rescue Grogu. Using a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, the group infiltrated Gideon's light cruiser. Boba feigned an attack, firing the weapons on Slave I at the Imperial shuttle to deceive the light cruiser's crew into believing that the shuttle was piloted by members of their remnant. With Djarin's team onboard the Class 546 Cruiser, Boba drew away three TIE/ln space superiority starfighters before jumping into hyperspace, leaving his allies to complete the mission.\nHaving paid their debt to Djarin, Boba and Shand returned to Tatooine where they confronted Bib Fortuna, a Twi'lek crime lord who once served as the majordomo of Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Following Jabba's death, as well as the rumored demise of Boba, Fortuna had seized his late master's throne in the ensuing power vacuum on Tatooine. Boba ended Fortuna's reign by killing and replacing him as the Daimyo of Mos Espa.\nThe newly styled Lord Boba Fett began building his own criminal empire on Tatooine. He established his headquarters in Jabba's old palace, keeping Shand as an ally and utilizing the droid 8D8 as an advisor. He also spared the lives of two Gamorrean Warriors, who once served Fortuna, after they agreed to become his bodyguards. In order to maintain Jabba's vast empire, Boba began vassalizing several prominent citizens of Mos Espa, such as Don Garfalaquox and Dokk Strassi of the Tatooine Trandoshan family. In addition, the Sanctuary—a cantina owned by Madam Garsa Fwip—was brought under Boba's control in the wake of Fortuna's death. Ultimately, his goal was to preserve Jabba's empire by controlling the vassals of the deceased Hutt crime lord. Unlike his predecessors who ruled through fear, Boba sought to build his reign on the respect of his vassals. However, Shand was convinced that fear was a more reliable form of control in unstable times.\nFollowing an attempted assassination on Boba by the Order of the Night Wind, Boba confronted Mok Shaiz, the Mayor of Mos Espa, although the mayor denied hiring the assassins. Boba then learned that the Twins—a brother and sister—arrived from Nal Hutta to claim the bequest of their late cousin, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Boba disputed the siblings' claim by stating that Jabba's territory had been usurped by Fortuna, who was killed by Boba in turn. As such, Boba asserted that he was the legitimate Daimyo of Mos Espa.\nThe millions of clone troopers who served in the Grand Army of the Republic deployed throughout the galaxy, fighting against Separatist forces on numerous contested worlds in the name of the Galactic Republic. However, neither the Republic nor the Jedi suspected that the clones whom they relied on were part of a Sith plot to take control of the galaxy. Programmed for absolute loyalty to the Supreme Chancellor, they executed their Jedi officers under Order 66, effectively purging the Jedi Order from the galaxy. In spite of their personal loyalty to the Jedi who fought alongside them, the clones were the instrument of revenge for the Sith and Jango Fett.\nAside from the clone troopers, the legacy of Jango Fett—reputedly the \"best bounty hunter in the galaxy\"—survived through Boba Fett, the clone whom he raised as his son. Boba was a precocious child who grew up in the criminal underworld after Jango's death. Aspiring to become a legendary bounty hunter, Boba's reputation would ultimately surpass that of Jango, who taught him the family trade, as Boba went on to become \"one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy.\" Boba carried the memory of his father into adulthood; he once used the alias \"Beskar Brawler Jango\" during his brief stint in pit fighting. After becoming a Daimyo on Tatooine, Boba experienced dreams of his past memories, including his childhood on Kamino and Jango's death on Geonosis.\nThe Fetts' first appearance as a duo was in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, where they acted as minor antagonists. At some point during the development of the Prequel trilogy, George Lucas considered making Boba Fett and Darth Vader stepbrothers, though he discounted it as \"too hokey.\"",
