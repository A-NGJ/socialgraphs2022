 "content": "Jarth Findo was a male Human, who worked as a mercenary during the Galactic Civil War.\nJarth Findo was born in the Corellian system and joined the Special Missions Company of the Imperial Army. However, after his company was nearly defeated by Alliance to Restore the Republic forces, Findo chose to desert. A group of stormtroopers were sent to hunt him down and he was barely able to evade them. Afterward, Findo established a small group of mercenaries, that was based in the Duro sector. The New Republic placed a bounty of 13,500 credits on Findo's head after his mercenaries raided several of their bases.\nFindo first appeared in the 1993 book Wanted by Cracken, a supplementary book for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game by West End Games. He was illustrated by Mike Jackson who used Jens Hausser as a model, although Jackson lamented that he could never get his drawings to look the same as Hausser.",
