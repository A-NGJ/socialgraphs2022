 "content": "Shai Tennem was a Bith male who was the administrator and overseer of the construction of the Starlight Beacon space station. When the station was completed, the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic held a conclave to celebrate it, and Tennem insisted on showing the visitors every element of its construction. While giving a tour to dignitaries including various Jedi and Republic Admiral Pevel Kronara, Tennem's party encountered technicians Joss and Pikka Adren, who were attempting to locate and fix a last-minute flaw they had discovered in the station's power systems. Tennem introduced the Adrens to the dignitaries and explained their work, with Joss suspecting that the administrator intended to rope them into joining the tour. However, Jedi Padawan Burryaga Agaburry and his Master Nib Assek intervened, allowing the Adrens to continue with their work. The delay Tennem had caused in the dignitaries' departure irritated Kronara, but allowed the Jedi and the Republic to utilize the cruiser Third Horizon, while in transit to Coruscant afterwards, to send a rescue effort to save the Hetzal system from debris in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. Jedi Master Avar Kriss, thinking about Tennem while coordinating the rescue effort, noted to herself that the Force sometimes worked in mysterious ways, including through officious Bith administrators.\nShai Tennem first appeared in the short story \"Starlight: Part One: Go Together,\" published in Star Wars Insider 199. In the story, Tennem is male; however, The High Republic: Light of the Jedi referred to Tennem as female.",
