 "content": "Gar-Ul was a male Weequay criminal active on Qiilura. He and his brother Guta-Nay were mercenaries employed by Ghez Hokan. It was said about Gar-Ul that he had more muscle than brains.\nIt was Gar-Ul who discovered Jedi Master Kast Fulier and his Padawan Etain Tur-Mukan after a group of farmers tipped him. Kast Fulier was captured, but Etain escaped and Gar-Ul was unable to keep up with the Jedi Padawan. During the search for Etain he crossed paths with the Galactic Republic clone commando Darman in the forest, who killed Gar-Ul quickly and silently with his vibroblade.",
