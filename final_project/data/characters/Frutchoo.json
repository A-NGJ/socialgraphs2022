 "content": "Frutchoo was a male Advozse biker who collected a spaceport tax on the planet Vaced. He lead a group of bikers which he referred to as his \"deputies\", but one member of the group did not like being bossed around an preferred the word \"associates\". He worked at the Vaced Spaceport, and welcomed the Jedi Nuru Kungurama and Breakout Squad to his planet. Kungurama used a mind trick to convince him that he did not want to collect their spaceport tax, and that him and his group were all very thirsty.",
