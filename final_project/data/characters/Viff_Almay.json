 "content": "Viff Almay was a female Neimoidian biographer who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nPreviously Viff Almay wrote a biography about Trade Baron Uunos Gooru, which won her the prestigious Golden Pylat Award. Later in 32 BBY, she was put into the Trade Federation Occupation Council by Viceroy Nute Gunray.\nHer position in the Occupation Council was chronicler, meaning she was tasked with chronicling the occupation for the Occupation Council.\nShe, the rest of the council, Nute Gunray, and Settlement Officer Rune Haako were in the Theed Royal Palace when Padm√© Amidala, Captain Quarsh Panaka, and the Royal Naboo Security Forces stormed in and shot down the battle droids guarding her along with the rest of the council, forcing her and the rest of the Neimoidians to surrender.\nShe was sent to trial on Coruscant along with the rest of the Trade Federation Occupation Council.\nViff Almay was first named in the Star Wars Insider 147 article The Devious Neimoidians Revealed by Tim Veekhoven, Kevin Beentjes, Sander De Lange, and Leland Chee.",
