 "content": "Phennir was a Human male Moff of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nPhennir oversaw an operation ordered by Darth Malgus to capture the Foundry, an ancient space station from the reign of the Rakata Infinite Empire that produced legions of battle droids. Phennir and his flagship, the Harrower-class dreadnought White Nova, first captured a Republic warship, the Dorin's Sky, with the authorization codes to approach the Foundry, then sent an elite strike team to take the Foundry itself and defeat its master, Revan.\nDuring the Battle of Ilum, Phennir was a member of an emergency war council called by Grand Moff Ilyan Regus when Malgus declared his \"New Empire\". Phennir was outraged when he realized that Malgus had played him, as the renegade Sith Lord had incorporated the Foundry and its technology into his space station.",
