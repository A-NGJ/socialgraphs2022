 "content": "Quintik Kahr, better known as \"Big Quince\", was an Outer Rim-based Sludir slaver and the brother of Omze'kehr Kahr. Before turning to slavery, he was a famous gladiator, fighting primarily in the pits of Loovria, using a force pike that he would carry for the rest of his life.\nKahr's base of operations was the immense slave ship that was called Quincey's Girl. He was exceptionally skilled at dealing with Imperial customs officers, bribing them with ryll, Gruvian Tovash, slave girls and the like, and thus had few problems with the Empire.\nQuintik Kahr was the owner of Tru'eb Cholakk and Platt Okeefe, the latter of whom he intended to give to Moff Antoll Jellrek as part of a bribe. However, both Cholakk and Okeefe managed to escape.",
