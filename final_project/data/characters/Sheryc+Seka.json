 "content": "Sheryc Seka was a Yarkora thief and smuggler. She maintained a professional relationship with the pirate Salmakk, who provided her with many rare weapons. She often split her time between Salmakk's base and the planet of Darlyn Boda, in particular the restaurant Pepper's Pax, looking out for business opportunities. Years later, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, both her business and reputation suffered due to her decision not to work with the Peace Brigade.",
