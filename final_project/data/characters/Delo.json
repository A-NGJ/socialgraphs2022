 "content": "Delo was a Rodian male con artist who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he resided aboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above the planet Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. During that time, the Rodian posed as a travel agent and used to sell false travel packages to Station Gamma, another space station close to Tansarii Point Station, to misinformed visitors. Hence, he presented Station Gamma as \"a vacationer's dream\" and as a \"resort in and of itself.\" In fact, Station Gamma was a very dangerous place since it had been overran by the Rak'qua, a tribe of violent Nautolans.\nDelo appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Delo was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
