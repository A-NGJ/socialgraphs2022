 "content": "Commander Palmer was a Human man who served the Galactic Empire during its early years. He worked as an Imperial Port Master and was in charge of a spaceport on the planet Byrsym.\nPalmer viewed anyone who was not a part of the Imperial Military as a threat, but was particularly biased against non-Humans. Due to the fact that Humans constituted only a small part of Byrsym's population, Palmer believed that the planet could explode into chaos at any moment, so he was prepared to maintain order on the world at any cost.",
