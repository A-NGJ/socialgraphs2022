 "content": "Sheray was a Human male colonel who served the Galactic Empire during the time of the Galactic Civil War with the Rebel Alliance. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Colonel Sheray processed a spacer through an Imperial space station.\nSheray was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. He was added to the game when the developers revamped the game during the Combat Upgrade of April 29, 2005. A revised tutorial was added with the upgrade which included Colonel Sheray.\nThroughout the tutorial, Sheray and other Imperial officers directed new players through a space station in order to help them get accustomed to the game mechanics. However, Sheray was removed alongside with this tutorial when the developers introduced the New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005. With this revamp, a completely new tutorial was added to the game in the form of Tansarii Point Station. No known screenshot of him exists, but he was identical in appearance to the other Imperial officers seen both throughout the tutorial, and other parts of the game.",
