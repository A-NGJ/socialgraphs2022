 "content": "Tilenna was a female t'landa Til who was the mate of High Priest Teroenza during the Galactic Civil War.\nLiving on Nal Hutta, Tilenna was separated from Teroenza for years while he led the Besadii spice operation on Ylesia. As a way for keeping the t'landa Til priests in line Aruk Besadii Aora, and later Durga Besadii Tai, made it a rule that no t'landa Til females could be present on Ylesia. But when the simpleton Kibbick became the Hutt overlord of Ylesia, Teroenza was able to smuggle Tilenna and the other female t'landa Til to the planet without the Hutts knowing.\nTilenna was killed when Jabba Desilijic Tiure sent assassins to Ylesia to kill all the priests in preparation for the Rebel invasion known as the Battle of Ylesia. She was relaxing in a mudpool with Teroenza and Veratil when armed mercenaries burst from the cover of the forests and fired on them. She was shot and then suffocated in the mud when she could not raise her head up to get air.",
