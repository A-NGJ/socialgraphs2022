 "content": "General Fefar Blackeye was a one-eyed Nosaurian, who led a rebellion on New Plympto against the Galactic Empire, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. However, he was captured by the Empire in 1 ABY. Popular legend had it that an Imperial commander trapped him in a copse and waited until sunset. When it came, Blackeye, in the manner of his people, was overcome with an urge to bray loudly, thus revealing himself. Blackeye later committed suicide in after spending six months in a zoo cage on Coruscant, and with his death, the rebellion broke apart.",
