 "content": "Tinté Vos was a Kiffar female who is the great-aunt of Kiffar Jedi Master Quinlan Vos and ruler of the twin worlds Kiffu and Kiffex during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nTinté began her career as a Kiffu Guardian, rising in rank to be their leader, while Kiffu and Kiffex were under the more benevolent rule of her brother Sheyf Kurlin Vos. Motivated by greed for power, she sacrificed Pethros and Quian Vos, father and mother of Quinlan Vos, to the Anzati who were on Kiffex to worship \"The Dreaming One\", Anzati Dark Jedi Volfe Karkko.\nShe then gave the guardian badges of his parents to young Quinlan, hoping to turn him to the dark side and mold him into an heir for herself. This enraged Kurlin, who gave the Jedi Watchman Tholme permission to take Quinlan to the Jedi Temple for training. In response, Tinté poisoned her brother and assumed his mantle as Sheyf.\nUnwilling to bow to Count Dooku's wishes to turn Kiffu and Kiffex into a staging ground for Separatist forces during the Clone Wars, Tinté was killed by Quinlan Vos at Dooku's behest, after being forced to reveal her murder of Quinlan's parents.\nIn the aftermath of her death, Kiffu and Kiffex were repressed by the Confederacy.\nSheyf Tinté Vos possessed of extreme nationalist tendencies and beliefs, considering the Republic a cultural melting pot that would only use and exploit Kiffu and Kiffex for its own gain. She did not regret sacrificing her relatives, and it was her lack of remorse that cost Vos her life.\nHer name is correctly spelled \"Tinté\" in Jedi: Count Dooku. However, in both Twilight and Darkness, it is spelled \"Tinte.\"",
