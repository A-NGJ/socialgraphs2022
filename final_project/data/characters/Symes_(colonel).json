 "content": "Colonel Symes was a human Imperial officer who held the rank of colonel. Colonel Symes was married to Major Symes and was a parent of Pandak Symes, a trainee at the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal. Pandak did not measure up to the rigors of the academy's basic training and, as he expected, disappointed his parents' high expectation.\nPandak Syme's parents were mentioned briefly in Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks, but it was unspecified which parent was the mother and which was the father, only that they held the ranks of major and colonel.",
