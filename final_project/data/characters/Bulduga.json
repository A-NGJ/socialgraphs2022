 "content": "Bulduga was half of a male Ithorian bounty hunter duo, alongside his brother, Onca. While Onca preferred long-range weapons, such as rifles, Bulduga preferred the quick-and-easily-accessible blaster pistols. Well-known throughout the galaxy, the two brothers gained the attention of Count Dooku, leader of the Separatists, and was given the challenge of winning the Box, a lethal bounty hunter competition. After gathering with Dooku's other assembled bounty hunters, Bulduga was killed by Cad Bane over a dispute regarding the Ithorian's wide-brimmed hat. Onca was left to compete on his own, but died during the second challenge.\nBulduga was an Ithorian male who, alongside his brother Onca, operated as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars. The two became regarded as a legendary duo. Preferring quick-draw blaster pistols over Onca's preference for long-range rifles, Bulduga was able to convince many targets that not all Ithorians fit the peace-loving agriculturist stereotype.\nBulduga's choice of weapons, coupled by his low-hanging holster, red-tinted goggles, and wide-brimmed hat caused bystanders to theorize that the Ithorian was nothing more than an imitator of the well-known bounty hunter Cad Bane, although no one would say such within earshot of the deadly Ithorian. Eventually, Bulduga and Onca attracted the attention of the Sith Lord Count Dooku, who was in league with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Count invited the hunters to the planet Serenno to compete in a lethal tournament called the Box.\nIn preparation for a risky mission to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Dooku invited a posse of bounty hunters to his homeworld in order to test their mettle in a series of challenges designed by criminal mastermind Moralo Eval. Those who survived the challenges would take part in Dooku's operation and receive a hefty reward upon the job's completion.\nBulduga and Onca assembled outside of the Box shortly before the tournament and came face to face with their competition, including bounty hunters Sixtat, Sinrich, Jakoli, Twazzi, Kiera Swan, Derrown, Mantu, Rako Hardeen, and Cad Bane. Before being admitted into the Box, Bane approached Bulduga, commenting on his hat. Bulduga, threatened, drew his blaster pistol but was outgunned by the faster Duros bounty hunter and was killed. Bane took Bulduga's hat for himself.\nOnca, who was given little sympathy, was forced to compete in the Box alone and died during the second challenge.\nAlthough many galactic citizens believed Ithorians to be being of peace, Bulduga was quite the opposite, being a dangerous bounty hunter. Unlike his brother, Bulduga was able to overcome his species' natural bulky build and became a fast-draw gunslinger. However, due to his fashion and weapon choices, some theorized that Bulduga attempted to imitate the bounty hunter Cad Bane. Upon being approached by Bane, Bulduga became defensive and instinctively reached for his guns. Despite being renowned for his quick draw, Bane was faster.\nBulduga was a tall, thin Ithorian who stood at 2.27 meters. Bulduga had brown-colored skin.\nBulduga carried a blaster pistol in a low slung quick-draw holster and fashioned himself with a black vest and a wide-brimmed hat. He also wore red-tinted goggles over his eyes that glowed in the dark.\nBulduga first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode \"The Box,\" which aired as a part of the show's fourth season.",
