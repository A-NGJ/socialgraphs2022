 "content": "Kisquar was a Mriss Black Sun operative. He was Sprax's chief lieutenant in the Sisar Run. Kisquar was in charge of shipjacking, stolen starship and parts fencing and an information broker. Before joining Black Sun, he was a prominent smuggler, shipjacker and pirate. Kisquar had contacts with both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. About twelve Black Sun agents worked for him, including infochants and ace pilots.\nKisquar's plumage was red and black.\nKisquar is identified as a Mriss in Secrets of the Sisar Run, though the illustration depicts him as a Mrlssi. This may very well be a mistake resulting from the two species being confused often.\n \"A Favor Done...\" â€“ Secrets of the Sisar Run",
