 "content": "Stell was a human male who agreed to go against the Galactic Empire alongside Rebb, his significant other. The two soon became an disciples of the Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr and they followed him to Mon Cala. However, they were soon found by Darth Vader who chased them to Bel City where Stell and Rebb stayed behind to slow him, and his team down.\nShortly after the founding of the Galactic Empire, Stell and Rebb witnessed their city get occupied by the new government. Rebb immediately expressed her hatred for the army of clone troopers taking over and refused to raise their children in a galaxy ruled by the Empire. Rebb subsequently convinced Stell to go against the Empire with her. A short while later, Rebb and Stell met an Iktotchi named Ferren Barr in a cantina. Barr claimed to be a Jedi Master, despite only being a Padawan, and told the two that he would give them a purpose in fighting the Empire. Rebb and Stell agreed to join him.\nBarr took Rebb, Stell and four other disciples to Mon Cala where Barr began influencing the monarchy in their negotiations with the Empire. Barr's actions caught the attention of the Emperor, who sent Darth Vader to Mon Cala to investigate. Vader brought with him three inquisitors and a squad of Purge Troopers and upon arriving at Mon Cala, he witnessed the assassination of the Imperial ambassador Telvar. The assassination kick-started an Imperial invasion of Mon Cala and Barr was soon notified of Vader's presence on the planet. Barr told Stell and the other disciples that Vader was really the Jedi Anakin Skywalker. Barr further explained to his disciples of how the Jedi Order believed in Skywalker and how Skywalker betrayed and destroyed them.\nShortly after, Barr was notified that Vader had discovered their location and was likely on his way. Barr's first response was to evacuate his refuge and he set it to self destruct. The disciples left the refuge to find Vader and his team had arrived. Without hesitation they scattered, except for Nipaltoo who attacked Vader's submarine. Vader crushed Nipaltoo's helmet, killing him and the other vectored towards Bel City. Vader's submarine slowly caught up with them and Orvek turned around to slow him down. Orvek's sacrifice got them to Bel City alive and Rebb decided to stay behind in order to slow Vader even more. Stell pledged to stay with Rebb as Barr and the other two disciples fled down a corridor.\nStell was a human male who had pale skin and green eyes. His hair was dark brown. Stell had spent most of his life with Rebb and was reluctant to leave her. Stell followed Rebb when she decided to go against the Empire and when she joined Barr. When Rebb decided to stay behind in Bel City, Stell did not hesitate to stay with her.\nStell first appeared in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader  14 written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli. Although Stell's fate is left ambiguous, a flashback occurred subsequent to his final appearance. This was similar to flashbacks that occurred after the deaths of other acolytes.",
