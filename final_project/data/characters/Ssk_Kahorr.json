 "content": "Ssk Kahorr was a Cha'a merchant lord active in the Koros system in the years leading up to the Great Hyperspace War. Kahorr employed an assistant named Gorrm and additionally was often seen with a small insectoid creature named Tk'lokk on his shoulder. In 5000 BBY, Kahorr sent a drone ship, the Zeta Five, along the hyperspace route Goluud Corridor to deliver supplies to a mining colony on Goluud Minor. The Zeta Five was destroyed by a solar flare, however, resulting in the loss of all cargo. An enraged Kahorr sent assassins after the two navigators who blazed the trail, siblings Gav and Jori Daragon. Unfortunately for Kahorr, the assassins were fended off by two Jedi Knights, Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill. The Daragons escaped the system, but Jori returned later, proclaiming that she had found the long-lost Sith Empire, and that they were planning to attack the Galactic Republic. Kahorr took this opportunity to seize Daragon's ship, the Starbreaker 12, as payment for the destruction of Zeta Five. The Cha'a merchant subsequently took the ship for a joyride to test its controls; however, the ship was destroyed by an incoming Sith fleet, killing Kahorr.\nSsk Kahorr, a male Cha'a, was a merchant active in the Koros system in the years leading up to the Great Hyperspace War. As a young Cha'a, Kahorr devoured his hatchling-mates, an event that he believed taught him to appreciate success. Later in life, having become a merchant lord, Kahorr employed a being named Gorrm as his assistant, and was frequently sighted with a small insectoid creature named Tk'lokk residing on his shoulder. In 5000 BBY, shortly after the Koros system Unification Wars, Kahorr sent a drone ship named Zeta Five to the Goluud system, where a new mining colony had been started on Goluud Minor. The ship contained components and equipment, which were vital for the survival of the young colony. Through spies in the Navigators' Guild, Kahorr learned of a newly discovered hyperlane, the Goluud Corridor, which purportedly would cut the ship's hyperspace time by a third, and increase their profits a hundredfold. Gorrm was wary of the route's safety, as it passed precariously close to the system's unstable red giant star, Primus Goluud. Nevertheless, Kahorr swore to its safety, as he trusted in the Navigators' Guild safety standards, and insisted that only cowards would fear such risks.\nUsing the Goluud Corridor, Zeta Five reached the Goluud system successfully, but encountered unexpected danger: stellar activity in the star Primus Goluud had entered a violent phase, and the ensuing solar flares destroyed the ship and its cargo. When Kahorr learned of the ship's destruction, he was enraged and ordered Gorrm to find out who approved the hyperlane so he could get revenge. When he discovered that it was Shodon Ko of the Navigators' Guild who approved the route, Kahorr had Ko murdered and then devoured his body. Next, Kahorr ordered Gorrm to find the being or beings who first blazed the trail. The beings in question were brother-and-sister hyperspace navigators Gav and Jori Daragon. Upon learning of the Daragons' identities, Kahorr sent two assassins after them, hoping to eat their corpses as well. Instead, the dispatched bounty hunters were killed by two Jedi, Memit Nadill and Odan-Urr, who happened to be in the area. With nothing but creditors waiting for them, the Daragons fled the Koros system in their ship Starbreaker 12, which they were forced to steal back from repair dock owner Aarrba.\nAfter taking the Starbreaker 12, the Daragons took a blind hyperspace jump and happened upon the Sith Empire, which had been isolated from the galaxy since the Hundred-Year Darkness nearly two thousand years before. There, they found Naga Sadow, a Dark Lord of the Sith who planned to follow the Daragons back to the Galactic Republic and wage war on the government that had exiled them after the Hundred-Year Darkness. Gav Daragon was kept behind by Sadow, who allowed Jori to flee back to the Republic. Unbeknownst to Jori, a tracking device had been placed on the Starbreaker 12, in order to lead the Sith to the Republic. Jori returned to the Koros system in the Starbreaker 12 and landed in the city of Cinnagar, telling her tales of Sith militarization for all to hear; however, her pleas for assistance against the Sith threat fell on deaf ears. A crowd immediately gathered around the Starbreaker 12, including Koros soldiers, who arrested her for stealing the Starbreaker 12 and firing on Cinnagar security ships during their escape.\nSsk Kahorr, accompanied by Gorrm, took this opportunity to push his way to the front of the crowd, proclaiming that the Starbreaker 12 was legally his as partial payment for the destruction of the Zeta Five. Kahorr had Gorrm give the pertinent records to the Cinnagar authorities. In a sudden Merchants' Guild decision, the Starbreaker 12 was awarded to the Cha'a merchant; the time limit for appeals had run out while Daragon was away in the Sith Empire. Daragon was promptly thrown in prison and was sent to the colony world of Ronika. Kahorr, having taken ownership of the Starbreaker 12, decided to take it out to test how the ship performed. Suddenly, a proximity alarm sounded. When Kahorr asked Gorrm what the source of the alarm was, Gorrm told him that a large number of ships were dropping out of hyperspace nearby. It turned out to be a large battle fleet: the Sith had followed Jori Daragon back to the Koros system, and were homing in on the Starbreaker 12. Before Kahorr and Gorrm could escape the Sith fired on the ship, destroying the Starbreaker 12 and killing Ssk Kahorr.\nSsk Kahorr was a shrewd businessbeing; he was able to find a way to potentially increase profits a hundredfold by using the Goluud Corridor, although that venture did not end the way he had hoped. He was also able to maneuver his way into control of the Starbreaker 12 after the arrest of Jori Daragon.\nKahorr was enraged upon learning of the destruction of Zeta Five and did not hesitate in ordering the deaths of Shodon Ko and the Daragons. Kahorr had a taste for flesh and excitedly looked forward to devouring the Daragons. Even though he lost the opportunity to eat Jori Daragon, he greatly enjoyed depriving her of the Starbreaker 12, ignoring her pleas for mercy. The Cha'a was particularly domineering to his subjects, especially Gorrm, and had a close owner-pet relationship to Tk'lokk, who he allowed to rest on his shoulder the majority of the time. Kahorr preached that one should enjoy one's success, due to the fact that success is hard to come by.\nSsk Kahorr first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: The Golden Age of the Sith, a story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic series, which was written by Kevin J. Anderson and released in 1996. He would later appear in The Golden Age of the Sith's follow-up arc, Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire, in which his character was killed. In these appearances, Kahorr was illustrated by Dario Carrasco, Jr. In 2008, Kahorr later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
