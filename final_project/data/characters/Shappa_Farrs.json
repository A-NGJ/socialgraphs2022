 "content": "Shappa Farrs was a male Ferroan living on Zonama Sekot as of 29 BBY. His wife was Sheekla. He helped introduce clients to their prospective seed-partners and to design their Sekotan vessels. He was short, slender and had black hair and prominent cheekbones. He lost his right arm, as well as two fingers on his left hand, while forging and shaping Sekotan ships; however, this did little to prevent him from his current assignment, which he pursued with great zeal.\nWhile he and his wife were gravely injured in the First Battle of Zonama Sekot, they both recovered before the planet jumped to hyperspace.",
