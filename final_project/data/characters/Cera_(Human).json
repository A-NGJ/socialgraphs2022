 "content": "Cera was a Human female member of a Republic archaeological salvage team in Olaris, on Taris during the Cold War. Most of her team was lost when rakghouls cut them off, and only Cera and her Sullustan colleague, Garthe, survived. She asked a traveling hero to find her team and see if anyone was still alive. After they returned with the bad news, they also revealed that Garthe and Elihsu had been stealing. Cera then asked the hero to investigate whether a group of rakghouls were in fact guarding their ancestors.\nCera appears in the mission \"The Corpse Counters\" in the 2011 BioWare game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
