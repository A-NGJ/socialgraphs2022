 "content": "Cid Rushing, whose wife and children were captured by Trade Federation forces, was one of Captain Quarsh Panaka's Security Officers during the Invasion of Naboo. A corporal in the Royal Naboo Security Forces, Rushing was charged with the protection of Queen Padm√© Amidala's Throne Room, and was among the security personnel who participated in the resistance to the Trade Federation.\nRushing was portrayed by Roman Coppola in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. His first name was based on a recurring character name in the Japanese role-playing game franchise Final Fantasy, as a response to the Final Fantasy franchise naming several of their characters after characters from Star Wars .",
