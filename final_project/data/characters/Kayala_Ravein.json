 "content": "Kayala Ravein was a female Human from Alderaan.\nShe was the daughter of an influential politician and lived a pampered life. However, her world was shattered when her mother was killed by a fleeing smuggler. This led her to take the law into her own hands. She became a free-range bounty hunter operating under the name Ra Katana. She used her Personal Luxury Yacht 3000, the Mystic Wanderer, as well as her father's influence and contacts to target criminals around the galaxy, and bring them to justice.",
