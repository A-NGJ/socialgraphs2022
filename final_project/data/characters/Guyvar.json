 "content": "Guyvar was a Human male Sith officer who served as a captain in the Sith Empire.\nCaptain Guyvar first appeared in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, but he was one of a number of elements that were not completed in the final release of the game. Guyvar was intended to participate in a mission dealing with visiting Chevin dignitaries and the enslaved Chevin working under the captain, but the mission—along with several other missions involving characters in or around Guyvar's camp—were cut from the game.",
