 "content": "Teeno was a male Human Sith Acolyte who attended the Sith Academy on Korriban during the Cold War.\nAlong with fellow acolyte Phyne, they held a hostility toward Vemrin who was very strong in the dark side. As a promising Sith Warrior was about to meet Darth Baras, Teeno, Phyne, and two other acolytes stood in stood in the antechamber to greet the acolyte. Knowing that Vemrin was going to have the new acolyte killed, they offered their assistance to eliminate Vemrin for the Sith Warrior, so that they would not be punished for disobeying the rules.\nThe Sith Warrior would consider their help, hinting that he agreed with their proposal. They obviously failed, since Vemrin returned from his trials. He then gloated how he murdered all the acolytes sent after him.\nLater, the warrior was contacted by a surviving Phyne, telling them how Teeno had been instantly killed by Vemrin and she was left crippled for many months. She realized Teeno was weak, her survival making her stronger than him.\nTeeno is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.\nIf the Warrior wasn't interested and refused their help, Teeno and Phyne offered to prove their skills to him/her in a duel, showing they were more than qualified to defeat and eliminate Vemrin. When the Sith Warrior agreed, Teeno, Phyne and the acolytes engaged him/her in a duel, in which they all lost. After their defeat, they realized they couldn't defeat Vemrin since the Sith Warrior was much stronger. Later, Phyne would contact the warrior, after witnessing Vemrin defeating six other acolytes and feeding their corpses to a tuk'ata. She thanked them for their survival and showing them the limits of their strength.",
