 "content": "Rautog was a male Gamorrean guard who worked for the Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure during the time of the Galactic Civil War. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, he was one of the guard's at Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine.\nRautog was one of thirteen Gamorrean non-player characters that could be found in Jabba's palace in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. His existence contradicted several other canon sources that claim only nine Gamorreans worked in the palace. This was further contradicted by the fact that Jubnuk, Thug, Thok, Warlug, Ghana Gleemort, and Grissom were not in the game, suggesting that a total of nineteen Gamorrean guards worked in Jabba's palace.",
