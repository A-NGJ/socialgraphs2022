 "content": "Nuj Sorwin was a male Gotal who was rescued from Imperial forces by the Spectres. Following his rescue, the Gotal was given shelter in the secret rebel settlement known as the Haven. Sorwin feared for his life, and believed that once the Empire no longer had use for him, he would be killed.\nAlthough Sorwin expressed gratitude to the Spectres for their aid, the thought that his family's current situation was only temporary still lingered.",
