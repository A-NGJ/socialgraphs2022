 "content": "Creeve was a male Human captain in the Galactic Empire.\nCaptain Creeve was an male Human officer in the Galactic Empire. He was posted to a planet where the locals were poor and willing to do anything for an extra credit, although he found the women to be a little too spirited for his tastes. Creeve was unaware that one of the technicians on the base, Troomis, was secretly a spy for Alliance Intelligence. Troomis' sister had been killed after an altercation with Creeve that had left a scar on his neck, and Troomis was planning revenge on the captain.",
