 "content": "Mathal was a male Human who was employed as a Black Sun agent during the Clone Wars. He oversaw the pan-galactic criminal organization's bota smuggling operations on Drongar.\nThough his superiors were unaware of it, Mathal attempted to keep a share of the bota for himself by claiming that Black Sun required a larger amount of bota than it needed from Admiral Tarnese Bleyd, the corrupt Republic Navy officer who was working with Black Sun in the bota smuggling ring. In response, Bleyd killed Mathal. In order to hide his crime, the admiral encased the Black Sun operative's body in a carbonite block. This was placed upon a small starspin vessel which was put on an autopilot course toward the Separatist blockade where it was destroyed.",
