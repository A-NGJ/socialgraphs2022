 "content": "Airen was a Human female who served as the mayor of Espelar Settlement on the planet of Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA female Human, Airen lived on the Outer Rim planet during the Great Galactic War and subsequent Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. By 3643 BBY, she had begun serving as the mayor of Espelar, a Human settlement near the native Jawa settlement of Camp Karnori. Espelar was located in the northern part of the Jundland Wastes, the region just south of the city of Anchorhead, and the settlement also had a small trading post to the west.\nWhen the former Jedi Galen Besk asked a Republic-allied individual to stop a group of Imperial saboteurs at Espelar's trading post, the individual came to Airen after they eliminated the Imperials. Her settlement was constantly plagued by broken equipment, sandstorms, and attacks by pirates and the native Sand People, so the individual offered to help out by aiding Junter Galt, the head of the area's branch of the Anchorhead Guard, in training the new recruits.\nAiren was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears in the Tatooine Bonus Series of missions for Republic players, after the player has defeated the saboteurs. Airen asks the player to go speak with Junter Galt, beginning the next missions.",
