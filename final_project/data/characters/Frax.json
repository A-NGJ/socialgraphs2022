 "content": "Frax was a male Kajain'sa'Nikto who lived in the galaxy. While being chased by TIE fighters on the planet Odona, Han Solo left him for dead in the Cordaxian Sea because the Millennium Falcon was holding two tons of Cordaxian ore. Solo dumped Frax in the Cordaxian Sea along with the ore. Frax would later become enslaved and forced into labor on the planet by the Empire. On a shore by the Cordaxian Sea, he was eventually found by a member of the Rebel Alliance after the Rebellion had bombed the shore to take out Imperial forces. Frax killed the rebel and journeyed across the sea on a journey of four months. With hired mercenaries Selt and a droid, he tried to kill Solo and Leia Organa during their mission to Odona, but failed. Frax murdered Selt and destroyed the droid when the two said they would leave. He left the cave he was in and went after Han and Leia, and died in a snow storm, his frozen body poised to shoot Organa.",
