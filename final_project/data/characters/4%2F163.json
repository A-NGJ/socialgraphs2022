He served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 22 BBY, the trooper was deployed in the First Battle of Geonosis, on the planet of the same name.\nStanding at a height of 1.83 meters like all clones of Jango Fett, he wore white Phase I clone trooper armor and carried a DC-15A blaster rifle in combat.\nClone trooper 4/163 was first named and depicted in the Star Wars Trading Card Game expansion Attack of the Clones, on the Clone Warrior 4/163 card. He is depicted on Geonosis, though no clone trooper appears in the Attack of the Clones movie with the background as seen in the card.",
