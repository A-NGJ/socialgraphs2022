 "content": "Khreenk was a male Trandoshan living in Bartyn's Landing from at least 130 BBY to 29 BBY. He owned and operated the business Khreenk's Smithy. He had several apprentices that forged the orders, but he supervised personally the work if the order was important enough.\nAs he had lived in Bartyn's Landing for more than one century, he knew many tales and legends, not all of which were true.",
