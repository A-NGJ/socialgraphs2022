 "content": "Jabitha Hal, nicknamed Wind by her father, was a Human/Ferroan hybrid born on Zonama Sekot.\nJabitha was the granddaughter of the planet's first Magister, Leor Hal. She survived the attack by the Far Outsiders—the name the Sekotans gave the Yuuzhan Vong—but her father was killed. However, Sekot made a mental image of her father, so that everyone believed that he was still alive.\nIn 29 BBY, she briefly befriended Anakin Skywalker, who named his ship after her. After the Second Battle of Zonama Sekot, Jabitha was on the planet when it disappeared into hyperspace towards the Unknown Regions.\nSome time later she herself became Magister. When Luke Skywalker and his team arrived on Zonama Sekot seeking help in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong, Jabitha was hesitant to act, but welcomed them out of memory of Anakin. Finally convinced that their intentions were good, she was instrumental in helping Sekot decide to join the New Jedi Order in attempting to peacefully resolve the Yuuzhan Vong War.",
