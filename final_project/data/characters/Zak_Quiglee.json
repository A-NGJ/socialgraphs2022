 "content": "Zak Quiglee, who also went by the nickname \"Squidfella\", was a Gungan male who participated in bongo racing on the planet Naboo shortly after the Invasion of Naboo. With Friggy Squig and Tup Tup Grizbain's support, Quiglee attempted to ban Neb Neb Goodrow and Spleed Nukkels from the sport on certain accusations. However, their accusations were overruled.\n\nQuiglee participated in the Otoh Gunga Challenge where he drove a monobubble bongo. He was close behind the lead at the beginning of the race, but would end up crashing later during the race. He went missing, leading to the suspension of Goodrow and Nukkels. However, it was part of his plan to keep them racing again. Quiglee stole a militia bongo and attacked them. The two racers, along with Major Fassa, used Boss Nass' racing bongo to disable his craft.\nIn turn, Quiglee was suspended and sent to an off-site clinic for counseling.",
