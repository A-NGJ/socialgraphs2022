 "content": "Skreech was a Hoopaloo male who worked for the criminal and mechanic Rekias Nodo at a shipyard on a jungle planet. The Hoopaloo also worked as a chef aboard Nodo's yacht. When the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca crash-landed onto the planet, Solo attempted to steal a heat exchanger to repair his starship, the Millennium Falcon, but was caught. Solo tricked Nodo into believing that he was Jabba the Hutt, and Nodo agreed to repair his ship, getting Skreech to cater to \"Jabba\" aboard his yacht. However, Skreech contacted the crime boss Lallani, a rival of the Hutt, informing her of Jabba's apparent presence. Lallani arrived at the shipyard to capture Jabba, but discovered that Nodo had been tricked.",
