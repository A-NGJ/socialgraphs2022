 "content": "Teef Lan Cody was the father of the Chief medical officer aboard the Galactic Empire prison barge Purge, Zahara Cody. He was in a relationship with the mother of his child. He was sent a letter by his child saying that Teef had been correct about something and that Zahara would return home and join an unidentified organization. Zahara also wrote a second, shorter letter telling him of a medical situation aboard Purge that was killing several people, causing chaos through the barge and driving some to suicide.It resulted in turning them into literal zombies. She stated that isolation and quarantine had no effect to the virus and that she felt it only a matter of time before she became infected as well. The letters were recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by a plague, so it is unlikely that they reached him before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge.",
