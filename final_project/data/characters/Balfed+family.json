 "content": "The Balfed family was a powerful nobility prior to the Galactic Civil War.\nThe Balfed family was once influential in galactic society. During the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Balfed family lost their influence and prestige. Their fall from grace was compounded when a rival, the House of Tagge, framed and disgraced them. The youngest descendent, Lord Espan Balfed, served as captain of a customs frigate. He had no money, influence or significance and was considered to be a noble in name only.",
