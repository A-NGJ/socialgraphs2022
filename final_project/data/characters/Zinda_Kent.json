 "content": "Zinda Kent was a female Human criminal who was a henchman of a local crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. A sniper, Kent was fair-skinned and had blond hair and a cybernetic eye, and her lieutenants were known as \"Blade Sisters.\"\nZinda Kent appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Kent can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon H-69, which appears on the planets Dromund Kaas, Coruscant, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine, and Alderaan. The player has the option to kill her or capture her alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord she worked for, where she was encountered, and her fate.",
