 "content": "Magras was a Human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire on Quesh during the Cold War. At one point in 3642 BBY, Magras captured Broga Masrii, the last remaining member of the Galactic Republic-allied Three Families, but was soon defeated by a Republic ally and Broga was saved.\nLord Magras appears as an enemy in the Republic faction's storyline on Quesh in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. He was also originally planned to be involved \"The Joy of the Hunt,\" an Imperial mission that would have involved a character named Lord Tragest, but the mission was cut before the game's release.",
