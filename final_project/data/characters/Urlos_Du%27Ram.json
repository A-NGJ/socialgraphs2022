 "content": "Urlos Du'Ram was a male Human pirate of the Death's Claw pirate gang who resided on Taris. Around 3643 BBY, he was killed by a Republic-affiliated individual.\nUrlos Du'Ram appears in the BioWareâ€“LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Taris. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by any Republic-affiliated character as part of the achievement \"Liberator of Taris\". This articles assumes 100% game completion, which means Du'Ram was killed.",
