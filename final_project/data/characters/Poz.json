 "content": "Poz was a female Human agent of the Republic Strategic Information Service living during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY Poz was stationed at the Meltwater Outpost in the High Security Section on Belsavis, where she investigated the Rakata teleportation technology and theorized that the teleporters might not be capable of actual matter transmission but instead replicating matter of a subject or even perhaps functioned as fixed dimensional pathways. As the possibilities were infinite, Poz dubbed them \"Instantaneous Travel Device\" and tracked the Esh-kha who were controlling the teleporter to an older vault.\nAgent Poz appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an NPC on Belsavis, involved in the planetary bonus series of quests.",
