 "content": "Professor Zanier Hudmasse was a Human male and droid-engineering scientist who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nProfessor Zanier Hudmasse resided on Naboo and was the Head of Research of Stonewall Labs until the company was closed by Professor Cordelis by the time of the Battle of Yavin. In 1 ABY, he met a spacer who was trying to acquire an Old Republic droid module from Stonewall Labs. Hudmasse agreed to help and dispatched the spacer to get a Stonewall Labs security beacon from former Chief Security Officer Vance Groten. He later dispatched the spacer to get a sequencer that can be used in a security beacon for Stonewall Labs from former technician Tanoa Vills. Professor Hudmasse finally assembled the sequencer into the security beacon. With this tool, the spacer was able to enter the Stonewall Labs headquarters and recover a Strategy/Tactics Simulation Chip installed in a droideka that was being studied in the laboratory.\nZanier Hudmasse appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Zanier Hudmasse was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
