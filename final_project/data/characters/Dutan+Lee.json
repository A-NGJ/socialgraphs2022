 "content": "Dutan Lee was an Arcona male arms dealer who headed the operations of the legitimate Gallisport-based Dutan Mining Supply Exports as a front for his smuggling of weaponry.\nDutan Lee was businessman who ran his family company that specialized in providing equipment for mining. He was also one of the preeminent arms dealers in the Minos Cluster. The Arcona would use his relationship with his cousin Dutan Kelliv to find out about shipments and security procedures. He also had a well developed network of other relatives who worked in local governments to provide him with information. Lee would constantly move his base of operations for security, but his sister Dutana Leara was a salt addict and often would give away his secrets when under the influence.\nDutan Lee was present at docking bay 1831 on Gallisport with Chop Harlison to meet Shamus Falconi and Grasheel. He had planned to sell illegal weapons to the smugglers. However, the meeting was interrupted by the arrival of Imperial Customs. He was worried that they would discover the weapons he had planned to sell to the smugglers, but after the search he was surprised to discover the crates were packed with legitimate mining equipment. After the Customs officials left, he found out that Renea Luies had swapped out the crates so that the containers of weapons could be smuggled off-planet.",
