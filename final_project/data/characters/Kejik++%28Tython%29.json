 "content": "Kejik was a male Duros merchant who lived on Tython, the homeworld of the Jedi Order, during the Cold War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. He ran a stimulant-selling business with a stand in Jedi Master Till'in's camp, which was located near the ruins of the ancient fortress city Kaleth and the Elarian Trail. A green-skinned Duros with large red eyes, Kejik lacked hair and did not speak the Basic language. He wore a dark gray robe over his light gray clothing, along with a black belt, boots, and a dark-colored armored ornament on his right shoulder.\nKejik first appeared in the BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released on December 20, 2011. As a vendor located on the planet Tython, Kejik and his shop are restricted to Republic-aligned players only. Kejik shares his name with a similar looking in-game Duros character, who can be found on the planet Balmorra, on the version of the planet available solely to Republic players.",
