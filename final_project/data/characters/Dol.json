 "content": "Dol was a Human male sergeant of the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. Following the Invasion of Ziost, he served on Darth Marr's flagship during the excursion into the Wild Space in an attempt to locate Vitiate, the former Sith Emperor, alongside Galactic Republic soldiers. During the mission, Marr's flagship was attacked by the Eternal Fleet, which deployed Skytroopers onboard through the boarding pods. When a group of Republic soldiers got cut off from the main force, Dol ordered to shut the blast door between them, to which Republic Corporal Ralo objected. At the end of the battle, the vessel Dol was on was destroyed, though some soldiers, such as Ralo, made it out in the escape pods.\nSergeant Dol appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 1: The Hunt. He is voiced by Nolan North.",
