 "content": "This human female was the mother of Tsabin, who later took the name Sabé after she became a handmaiden of Queen Padmé Amidala. By the time Amidala served as Naboo's senator four years later, Sabé noted that her parents no longer called her Tsabin. Following Amidala's funeral in 19 BBY, Sabé returned to her home in Theed. Whilst at her home, her comm chinned. Believing it might have been her mother, Sabé ignored it as she didn't want to talk, though in actuality it was Senator Bail Organa.",
