 "content": "Pol Handerin was a Human male farmer who lived on the planet Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nPol Handerin lived in a farm on the outskirts of Coronet City during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, the farmer got into serious trouble because of wild creatures and bandits that plagued his farm. Handerin thus went to seek help from the Corellian Security Force. In 1 ABY, CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper dispatched a recruit to help the farmer. Pol Handerin first tasked the CorSec agent to hunt and eliminate a pack of enraged carrion spats that did a lot of damage. The CorSec agent succeed and even killed the pack leader Gravefeather. Handerin then asked the CorSec agent to deal with a group of criminals, the Nedgarr Bandits, who damaged crops and stole grain. The mission was once again successful. The CorSec agent managed to recover the stolen grain and eliminate several bandits, including their leader Trae Nedgarr, during an assault on the Nedgarr Bandits Hideout. Handerin was really thankful for the help he received and that solved all his problems. When the CorSec agent mentioned his will to work for the government, Pol Handerin eagerly proposed to introduce the CorSec agent to his cousin, Gallura Handerin, a government aide in the Coronet Capitol.\nPol Handerin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nPol Handerin was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. He was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
