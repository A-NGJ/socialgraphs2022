 "content": "Abu Banu was a male Cerean doctor who served aboard the first Death Star.\nBanu was reputably one of the best brain surgeons in the galaxy and, as the battle station's only qualified neurosurgeon, he was one of few non-Human beings in a position of authority onboard. Banu was the head of the surgical team that conducted the operation to save Admiral Natasi Daala's life after she was injured in the attack on the first Death Star. After the operation, Wilhuff Tarkin was not thrilled with the result, but he refrained from punishing Banu.",
