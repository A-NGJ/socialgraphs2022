 "content": "Kiras Torla was a Human living during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Around 10 BBY, Torla was a member of Twilight Class at the Galactic Outdoor Survival School. During her studies, Torla became a close friend of the GOSS staff, including the dean Barosa Warren.\nTorla graduated with honors alongside the rest of her class. However, the other eleven in Twilight Class decided to join the Rebel Alliance and, as a result, gained Warren as an enemy. Torla never joined the Alliance but she was specially scared of her former friend. Thus, she disappeared from the Imperial space. Around 2 ABY, it was believed that Torla, by then a middle-aged scout, was somewhere in the Wild Space.",
