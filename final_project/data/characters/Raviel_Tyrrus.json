 "content": "Raviel Tyrrus was a Human male slicer who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nRaviel Tyrrus was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Raviel Tyrrus spawned under the generic \"slicer\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of eight possible depictions. He could either appear as four different types of Human males, or as four different types of Human females. Because the quest dialogue identified Tyrrus as a male, this article assumes that one of the four Human male depictions are canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
