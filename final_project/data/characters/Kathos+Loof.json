 "content": "Kathos Loof was a miner during the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War. He was mining chief working in the Graveyard of Alderaan when Darth Vader \"requested\" Loof allow a team of Imperial Intelligence agents use his station as a base of operations in a trap set to capture Princess Leia Organa. Loof readily agreed, being a staunch supporter of the New Order.\nLoof had a son named Trammis in the Imperial Army stationed somewhere in the Coruscant system. He believed the Rebel Alliance was doomed to failure and viewed them as the greatest threat to his son's safety. He was a man who enjoyed his line of work and had a natural aptitude for seeking out and finding new ore deposits.",
