 "content": "Elan was a female Lurmen who lived on the planet Qalydon during the Imperial Era. She was the wife of her village's chief, Biz, and the mother of Maynar, who helped the Freemakers in protecting their home from the Galactic Empire.\nElan lived with her husband Chief Biz and their daughter Maynar in a Lurmen village on the planet Qalydon during the Imperial Era. Her family had inhabited the village for generations where they worshiped the Force using kyber crystals.\nPrior to the Battle of Endor, the Freemakers visited the planet seeking kyber crystals for their quest to build the Arrowhead starship in order to turn the tide of the Galactic Civil War. Elan initially thought the offworlders' starship StarScavenger was lost and disagreed with Ymojin's suggestion that they had come for a marriage.\nWhen the Freemakers revealed that they were seeking kyber crystals, the Lurmen including Elan reacted with hostility, believing that the offworlders were Imperials. Elan and some of the villagers attacked them with catapults. When the B1-series battle droid Roger remarked that he thought that Lurmen were not violent, Elan countered that some of them were and fired a second salvo at Zander Freemaker. Zander's sister Kordi Freemaker managed to bring an end to the hostilities by convincing the Lurmen that they were not from the Empire.\nLater that night, Elan and her husband Biz hosted the offworlders and told them about their history and customs. Elan explained that much of their tribe had given up their crystals and thought their way of life was dying out. Biz and Elan were unwilling to give up their crystals but were unable to offer information on where the Freemakers could find other crystals. She was also curious about Roger, asking if he was indeed a metal droid.\nShortly later, the village was raided by the Imperial officers Durpin, Plumestriker, and a contingent of stormtroopers. The Imperials confiscated their kyber crystal necklaces for the second Death Star. During the occupation, Elan defied the thin-skinned Durpin by calling him a \"scum weasel\" and \"nerf herder.\" Before the Imperials could do further damage, Kordi and Zander's Rowan Freemaker and Maynar used the StarScavenger's laser cannons to drive away the Imperials. The Imperials escaped on their Gozanti-class cruiser but Rowan shot it down over the mountains.\nWhile the Freemakers undertook a mission to recover the stolen crystals, Roger helped Biz to repair a damaged wall. Elan called her daughter Maynar for help. However, Maynar had stowed away with the Freemakers to recover the crystals. Despite being held hostage by the Imperial hunter droid M-OC, the Freemakers managed to rescue Maynar and recover the crystals. Elan and her husband welcomed the Freemakers home. Though Biz offered the Freemakers the crystals, Rowan was unwilling to deprive them of their relics and left peacefully.\nElan was a female Lurmen with brown eyes and grey skin. She was a fighter who knew how to use catapults. Elan also had a feisty spirit and defied Durpin and his Imperial troops when they occupied their village. Elan shared her husband Chief Biz's appreciation for her people's kyber crystals, which they used to commune with the Force. She admired Rowan when he refused to take her people's crystals and remarked that he had a feisty spirit.\nElan first appeared in the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two episode \"The Lost Crystals of Qalydon\", which premiered on Disney XD on August 7, 2017. She was voiced by Pamela Adlon, who also voiced Ymojin.",
