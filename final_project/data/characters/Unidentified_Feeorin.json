 "content": "This male Feeorin, along with Geddy, Grintlok and Kubla, kidnapped Mi, the daughter of King Arturo, and demanded a ransom for her release. After Grintlok hired Han Solo to deliver the princess to their base on Raltac III, the group was contacted by Raze, who in turn hired them to rescue the princess for a significant reward. The four intercepted Solo on Cataalda and were planning to kill him to get to the princess when Raze arrived at the place, along with Arturo himself. Mi identified the gang as her captives and Raze promised Arturo to deal with them personally.",
