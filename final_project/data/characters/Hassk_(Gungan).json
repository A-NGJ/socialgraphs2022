 "content": "Captain Hassk was an extremist Gungan male warrior who lived on Naboo's moon of Rori during the Galactic Civil War. He had a strong distaste for the Galactic Empire and those who gave in to the wishes of the Naboo.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Captain Hassk was the commander of the Rorgungans, a group of extremist Gungans who violently opposed Boss Rugor Nass's support of Naboo's human population during the Invasion of Naboo and rejected any alliance between humans and Gungans. Captain Hassk believed that the Gungans of Naboo were weak and too afraid to stand up for their own rights.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Captain Hassk was leading the Gungan resistance on Rori against the Galactic Empire from a camp established deep in the heart of the swamps of Rori. It was from here that he welcomed fellow Gungans to seek refuge from the oppression of Imperials. In order to strike out against the Empire, Hassk also intended to recruit Gungans from Naboo to support the Rorian Gungans in their fight. He would later strike from the moon against the forces controlling the Naboo system in an attempt to free Naboo and Rori. Lieutenants Ori and Heb Nee served under him.\nCaptain Hassk appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Captain Hassk was added to the game with the \"Publish 1\" update, released on August 3, 2003.",
