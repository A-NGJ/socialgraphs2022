 "content": "RC-1262, nicknamed \"Scorch,\" was a clone commando who served in the Galactic Republic's clone army as part of the elite unit Delta Squad. In 20 BBY, the squad recovered two killed Jedi from the planet Devaron following a massacre there led by Count Dooku's new Sith apprentice, Savage Opress. Delta Squad took the bodies to the Jedi temple on the planet Coruscant and reported to four Jedi High Council members there.\nIn the period following the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Scorch was involved in the training of the first generation of non-cloned Imperial stormtroopers at an Imperial base on the planet Daro. After fellow clone commando CC-5576-39 \"Gregor\" was captured trying to desert the base, the rogue clone commando unit known as the Bad Batch infiltrated the base to free him. Scorch engaged Gregor and his liberators and pursued them, wounding Gregor and overpowering Tech before being incapacitated by a flurry of stun blasts by the remaining rogue commandos. He later regained consciousness and joined Imperial troops on an LAAT/i gunship to apprehend the Bad Batch leader, Hunter, taking him into Imperial custody.\nRC-1262 was created on the planet Kamino as a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett to be part of the Galactic Republic's clone army. Nicknamed Scorch, he became a clone commando and part of commando unit Delta Squad—alongside Clone Sergeant RC-1138 \"Boss,\" RC-1140 \"Fixer,\" and RC-1207 \"Sev\"—during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatist Alliance. At one point he and the rest of Delta Squad were dispatched into a conflict from an LAAT/i gunship to seize a location of importance to them.\nIn 20 BBY, Delta Squad was deployed on a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle to the planet Devaron, where Jedi Master Halsey, his Padawan Knox and their clone troopers had been massacred at the Jedi Order's Temple of Eedit by Separatist forces led by Count Dooku's new Sith apprentice, Savage Opress. The squad recovered the bodies of Halsey and Knox and transported them to the Jedi temple on the capital planet Coruscant. After landing, the commandos brought a coffins of the two dead Jedi, Scorch flanking Boss, who informed Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and three other members of the Jedi High Council about how none of the Republic forces had survived the attack on Devaron.\nThe Clone Wars ended in 19 BBY with the fall of the Separatists and the transition of the Republic into the Galactic Empire. The Empire sought to begin to phase out the clone army inherited from the Republic and began training a new conscripted stormtrooper army. On the planet Daro, Scorch was one of fifty clone commandos involved in the training of the first generation of the new stormtroopers at an Imperial base encased in a mountain. One of the commandos, CC-5576-39 \"Gregor,\" became disillusioned with the Imperial cause and attempted to desert, but was quickly captured by the base's troopers. Gregor, though, had activated a distress beacon, and Clone Force 99, a rogue clone commando unit better known as the \"Bad Batch,\" was sent to rescue the imprisoned commando.\nThree members of the Bad Batch, Sergeant Hunter, Tech and Echo, infiltrated the Imperial base and freed Gregor from his cell, alerting the Imperial forces there of the incursion. Scorch and a squad of stormtroopers went to a turbolift, only to encounter Gregor and the three infiltrators. As the Imperial commando and his troops raised their blasters, Gregor and Hunter kicked Scorch back into the troopers and shut the lift door just as the Imperials fired on them. Scorch and two stormtroopers fired on the turbo lift as it descended. The commando and his troops continued to pursue Gregor and the infiltrators, who stunned many of the troopers along the way and utilized a smoke bomb to cover their retreat.\nTo flank his targets, Scorch took a shortcut and jumped across a moving lift. Scorch was quick to ambush Gregor and his liberators, shooting Gregor twice in his chestplate and overpowering Tech. However, Hunter and Echo bombarded the Imperial commando with multiple stun blasts to incapacitate him. After regaining consciousness, Scorch joined a complement of stormtroopers and two clone commandos on an LAAT/i gunship as Gregor and the Bad Batch attempted to escape on their Omicron-class attack shuttle, the Marauder. In the escape attempt, Hunter failed to board the Marauder and fell down the mountain. The LAATs deployed Scorch and his troops shortly before Hunter, and the unit apprehended the rogue clone commando.\nAs a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, Scorch stood at 1.83 meters tall and had tan-colored skin.\nScorch wore the standard armor of a clone commando with gray, white and yellow colors and a backpack. He wielded a DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System and later a DC-15A blaster carbine.\nRC-1262 first appeared in canon continuity in \"Witches of the Mist,\" the fourteenth episode of the third season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars which aired on January 21 2011. He was identified as \"Scorch\" in the original episode guide for the episode, and as RC-1262 in the 2021 reference book Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!. RC-1262 \"Scorch\" was originally created in Star Wars Legends continuity when he appeared in the the 2005 video game Star Wars: Republic Commando, which was centered around Scorch's unit Delta Squad. In the game, Scorch was voiced by Raphael Sbarge, who also previously voiced the character Carth Onasi in the 2003 digital roleplaying game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.\nAfter Scorch reappeared in canon in \"War-Mantle,\" the fourteenth episode of the animated Disney+ series Star Wars: The Bad Batch which aired July 30 2021, David W. Collins, who did sound for the episode, revealed that he had reused the original game sound for Scorch's DC-17 blaster from Star Wars: Republic Commando.",
