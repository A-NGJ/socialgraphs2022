 "content": "Nia was a female Human Jedi Initiate who studied with the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Nia was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Initiate Nia remained at the academy and continued to study under the instructors that remained.\nAfter three years of fighting, the war came to a sudden end when the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order by issuing Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army of the Republic, an order which commanded the clone troopers to execute their Jedi leaders. Able to escape into the shadows when the clones attacked, Nia and several of her peers, including Initiate Bon, were rescued by a junk salvager named Hurd Coyle. Aboard his salvage ship, the Initiates remained together as Coyle promised to take them to a safe location.\nDuring their travel, Coyle's ship picked up a damaged V-19 Torrent starfighter, hoping to salvage some of the ships parts. Coyle was surprised to learn that it held the still alive clone pilot HOB-147. When the clone woke up and started to destroy Coyle's reprogrammed B1-Series battle droids Coyle shot the clone with an electro-dart and locked the pilot in a room. When the clone escaped he found the Jedi Initiates hiding in the junk ship's hold. Thinking that the clone was going to kill him and his peers, Nia and the other Initiates knocked the man unconscious. When he awoke, the clone was convinced by Initiate Nia to spare her peers' lives. Later, when Coyle's ship was boarded by stormtroopers of the newly christened Galactic Empire, who were looking for escaped Jedi, clone HOB-147 lied and said there weren't any Jedi aboard the ship, allowing Nia and her fellow Jedi to escape.",
