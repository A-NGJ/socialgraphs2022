 "content": "Grenz Zittoun was an Aqualish male member of the Lok Revenants who lived on Lok during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Grenz Zittoun was a member of the Lok Revenants and a lieutenant of their leader Nym. He used to work in Nym's palace, in the city known as Nym's Stronghold.\nIn 1 ABY, Zittoun was involved in most major operations of the Lok Revenants. That year, the Lok Revenants assaulted the hideout of their enemies, the Sulfur Lake Pirates, to retrieve the valuable memory module of an Imperial droid. Grenz Zittoun tasked a spacer involved in this mission to kill a grotesque creature named Nym's Girlfriend so that it could no longer serve as a derisive symbol for the pirates. The same year, the Lok Revenants raided an Imperial mine where the release of an unknown toxic gas had made the miners become completely crazy and very hostile. Zittoun requested the spacer to eliminate two miners, the grand foreman Rel Rogock and the mine controller Teemu Komo, who were responsible for random attacks on the inhabitants of Lok. Later, the Revenants attacked an Imperial research facility on Lok to steal experimental weapons developed and produced there. This time, Grenz Zittoun asked the spacer to kill Kell Lapaz and Udo Barnet, the leaders of the mercenaries who defended the facilities.\nGrenz Zittoun was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Grenz Zittoun was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
