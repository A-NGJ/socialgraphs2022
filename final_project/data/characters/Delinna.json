 "content": "Delinna was a female Wookiee, who lived on the planet of Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDelinna was mated to Surracca and they lived in the village Kiirloor on the planet of Cularin. When Kiirloor began to suffer a series of problems that culminated in the disappearance of a child, Delinna traveled with Surracca to Mother Dariana's naming day ceremony, to ask her for help. Surracca was very angry because of the problems at Kiirloor, so Delinna tried to calm him down. The two Wookiees then traveled back to the village with the Heroes of Cularin. However, while they traveled, there was a groundquake and they arrived at the village to find it very damaged.",
