 "content": "Irtanna was a female Human Republic soldier who joined the Army of Light during the New Sith Wars.\nAround 1001 BBY, she was evacuated from Ruusan, along with thousands of Jedi, just before Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan detonated the thought bomb in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. She was selected personally by Lord Valenthyne Farfalla to lead the rescue effort on Ruusan, searching for surviving members of the Army of Light.\nWhen Farfalla refused to allow Johun Othone, Lord Hoth's former Padawan, to join the rescue teams, Othone used a mind trick on Irtanna to persuade her to let him join the team, against Farfalla's orders. During the rescue missions, Irtanna piloted the Star-Wake, an Envoy-class shuttle, which was also crewed by Bordon and his sons, Tallo and Wend. Finally, they came across a little girl who seemed to be a war orphan. The girl was named Rain, but was actually revealed to be Darth Zannah who served as the student of the Sith Lord Darth Bane. As the Star-Wake again opened in the direction of the Republica fleet, Irtanna suddenly heard shots from the hold of the shuttle. As she was about to see what was going on, Irtanna and her crew were murdered by Zannah who came inside the cockpit. After taking the Star-Wake, she set course to Onderon.",
