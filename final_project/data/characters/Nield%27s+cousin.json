 "content": "Nield's cousin was a female Human Daan from the planet of Melida/Daan. She was left to take care of her younger cousin Nield at age fourteen when Nield's mother, Leidra, went off to fight in a battle against the Melida and died. Nield and his cousin escaped to the planet's capital city of Zehava during a later Melida invasion, where they stayed for several years. When she was seventeen years old and Nield was eight, she was forced to fight in a Daan attack on the Melida sector, in which she perished.",
