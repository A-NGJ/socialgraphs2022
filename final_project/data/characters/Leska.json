 "content": "Leska was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Leska was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. After crafting for herself a blue-bladed lightsaber, Leska was made a Jedi Knight. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Leska was hastily made a Jedi Master and was assigned the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic and expected to lead clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army.\nThough young and inexperienced, Master Leska was one of the Generals assigned to lead Republic forces on the dreary world of Jabiim. Along with fellow Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Norcuna, Master Leska assisted in leading the massive effort on the planet. She became the task force's leader after Jedi Master Norcuna was killed. As her fellow Jedi and her troops died, Leska soon found herself the most senior member in the Grand Army on planet. On the thirty-seventh day of battle, Master Leska fought on the soaked, battle-torn landscape when the clouds parted to reveal sunlight for the first time in a month. Distracted by the light, Master Leska let down her guard and was killed by blasterfire from the ruthless forces of local Separatist General Alto Stratus.",
