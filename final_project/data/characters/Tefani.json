 "content": "Tefani was a male Zabrak member of the Second Battalion of the Republic Medical Corps living during the Galactic War. More commonly known as the \"Protectors\", this humanitarian division served alongside the Republic Military on battlefields across the galaxy, conducting rescue, reconnaissance, and evacuation operations to help civilians who were caught in the crossfire. In 3638 BBY Tefani along with the rest of the Battalion was deployed on the disaster-stricken planet of Makeb, where he and Cash Zarrin worked on evacuating civilians from the groundquake-hit Talaos City, asking a Republic agent on the planet to clear out the InterStellar Regulators to allow the Protectors to do their job. When a group of workers refused to leave, believing the Hutts's lies about the nature of groundquakes, Tefani had to personally convince them to evacuate before their house was destroyed.\nTefani appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion, released on April 9, 2013. Cut content in the game files indicates that he was originally involved in the Jedi Knight class story missions  on Bothawui and Sleheyron.",
