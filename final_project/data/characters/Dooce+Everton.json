 "content": "Dooce Everton was a Bith male who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nA detective, Everton was hired by Senate security to discover who was leading the Black Sun gang on Coruscant. He had been working an informant named Deringon Lobacc for several weeks, convincing him to give Dooce information on Black Sun's leadership.\nEverton encountered a problem when Lobacc refused to meet anywhere but the Silent Sun cantina deep in Black Sun territory. As Everton was known in that area, he asked a traveling hero to contact Lobacc and get his information. Thanks to the hero's efforts, Dooce was able to pass on his findings to the Senate.\nDooce Everton appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, as part of the Coruscant mission \"The Pickup\".",
