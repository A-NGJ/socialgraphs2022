 "content": "Phasma's clan was a small and weak family that Phasma and her brother Keldo were part of prior to joining the Scyre. It resided in the families only territory directly around the Nautilus on the planet Parnassos. As their mother, father, aunts and uncles were too old and weak to fight and their younger cousin was too small to contribute, Phasma and Keldo, despite being only children, were forced to rise to the occasion and defend their territory from raids from the Scyre and Claw. During one such raid, the younger cousin was captured by the Dug Balder for the Claw.\nBy 19 ABY, the family had lost half of its members within the past year alone and were eventually wiped out when Phasma orchestrated the family's death so that she and Keldo could survive but still live in the Nautilus. After the Scyre had killed their family, Phasma and Keldo pledged their allegiance to the Sycre by painting themselves with oracle salve made from their family.",
