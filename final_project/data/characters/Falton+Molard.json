 "content": "Falton Molard was a male Human member of the Rebel Alliance found in the Hidden Rebel Base on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY all the data disks used by the Rebellion at the base were stolen by an Imperial spy. The spy was killed when his ship was shot down by the Alliance, but the data disks were destroyed as well. It fell to Molard to recompile all the lost data. He therefore had to question all operatives working for the local branch of the Alliance regarding their operations history.\nFalton Molard is a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. He was added to the game after the Rebel Theme Park, a series of missions for the Rebellion, was overhauled. Players who already finished the old version of the quest line can talk to him and reset the missions so they can run the revised version of the quest line, too.",
