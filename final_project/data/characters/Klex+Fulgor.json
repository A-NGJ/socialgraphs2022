 "content": "Klex Fulgor was a Human male Imperial Inquisitor who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Inquisitor Klex Fulgor was based at the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir.\nIn 1 ABY, an accident took place in the research facility. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into cannibalistic undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Fulgor, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nKlex Fulgor took shelter in Camp Epsilon, the most unsafe camp since it was located in the courtyard of the Imperial Research and Prison Facility, the place where lived the most dangerous undeads. Other survivors in the camp at that time included the former prisoner Zsu Val, the technician Sogan Varga, the mechanic Nils Cridmeen, and the stormtroopers GT-643, KD-121 and HX-138.\nAt some point, the camp was visited by a group of spacers who pretended to be charged with a secret mission for Darth Vader himself. They needed to get access the Imperial Research Facility in order to recover an original sample of the Blackwing virus. Inquisitor Fulgor then accepted to help the spacers to find a way to access the facility. The spacers survived to their exploration of the research facility and finally came back to Camp Epsilon. In the meantime, Nils Cridmeen was able to repair a Lambda-class shuttle present in the camp. The refugees of Camp Epsilon and the spacers eventually escaped the Quarantine Zone altogether with the shuttle.\nKlex Fulgor was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Klex Fulgor was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
