 "content": "Losha Tarkon was a human female and the partner of the former bounty hunter T'onga. Tarkon and T'onga lived together on the Moon of Logal Ri, where they planned to live as farmers. However, after Nakano Lash, who was responsible for the death of T'onga's brother T'ongor, supposedly resurfaced, T'onga left to hunt her down. Tarkon attempted to stop T'onga from leaving, but was unable to change her mind.\nTarkon later found an injured T'onga on Ruusan, where the two reunited, and assembled a crew, and set off to find Cadeliah, the heir to Mourner's Wail and Unbroken Clan crime syndicates.\nLosha Tarkon resided on the Moon of Logal Ri alongside former bounty hunter T'onga as a farmer during the Imperial Era. Around 3 ABY, the notorious bounty hunter Nakano Lash resurfaced under with a large bounty on her head, attracting the attention of several bounty hunters. T'onga, seeking revenge for her brother's death at the hands of Lash, decided to take on the bounty and hunt her down.\nTarkon approached T'onga while the latter was leaving the farm, and asked her if she was planning to leave without saying goodbye, wishing to see T'onga alive at the end of the mission. After touching their foreheads together, T'onga revealed her reason for leaving while entering her starship. Tarkon reminded the former hunter that she promised to abandon her bounty hunting life and spend the rest of her days planting crops, as the farmer did not wish to dig a grave for the former hunter. Tarkon could only watch and cry as T'onga departed the moon aboard her starship to begin her hunt for Lash. Little did Tarkon know, after a journey with Beilert Valance, Boba Fett incapacitated T'onga in the orbit of Ruusan in a skirmish involving Lash, Fett, and Valance, in which Lash was killed.\nTarkon followed the trail of her lost wife to Ruusan. There, she finds T'onga in a hospital bed, being treated for her injuries. Once T'onga was more recovered, the two state their love for each other, and decide to track down and bring Nakano Lash's killers to justice. The man who healed T'onga then offered the pair his Nexu for help. Soon after, they observed that Jabba the Hutt placed a bounty on Fett's head.\nBack on Dotharian, T'onga and Tarkon visited the Fortress of the Mourner's Wail, and found devastation there, with scorch marks all over. T'onga ventures inside, only to find Khamdek and several soldiers, who warns her to leave as soon as she can. This warning is too late, as Crimson Dawn is already inside the building. A battle ensues, as the two syndicates face off. At one point, T'onga, aiding the Mourner's Wail, is knocked over and pinned down by a Crimson Dawn enforcer, but is saved by the Nexu and Tarkon. The team together takes out several more Crimson Dawn enforcers, as T'onga comes to an injured Khamdek's side. She informs the man that he has a granddaughter, and he instantly feels remorse for the situation. He then hires the wives, enlisting them to assemble a crew and rescue Cadeliah.\nTarkon and T'onga recruited Tasu Leech from the fighting pits of Nar Kanji, and Zuckuss from the Gand floating sanctuary. In the Edgehawk, the crew arrives on the planet Jekara, where Crimson Dawn is holding an auction for Han Solo, finding the location through Zuckuss's tracking skills. The team discovers a bound Bossk, who tricks Zuckuss, stealing his knife and revealing that Valance was there as well to a shocked T'onga.\nLosha Tarkon was a human female with pink hair, blue eyes, and light skin. Tarkon was deeply saddened to see T'onga depart the Moon of Logal Ri as the farmer did not want to lose her, pleading with the former hunter to stay behind and plant crops in the land instead. Later, Tarkon demonstrated her dedication to her wife by tracking her down to Ruusan, where the two happily reunited and assembled a crew to work together against Crimson Dawn.\nLosha Tarkon wore brown overalls over a light-colored shirt, as well as brown gloves. When in the field with T'onga, she wore shoulder pads, had a cape, helmet, and wielded two blaster pistols.\nLosha Tarkon first appeared in the first issue of Star Wars: Bounty Hunters, a comic book series written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Paolo Villanelli, and published by Marvel Comics on March 11, 2020.",
