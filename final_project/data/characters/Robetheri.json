 "content": "Robetheri was a Nightsister War Chief from the misty world of Dathomir. In the later years of the Galactic Civil War, the witch ruled over the wardens of an Imperial prison as a dark queen.\nA Human female from Dathomir, Sister Robetheri was born to a Nightsister coven. She grew up learning the secrets of Shadow Magic as well as fighting techniques. Thanks to her success on the battlefield, Robetheri eventually attained the rank of War Chief and rose to power in her clan.\nDuring the wake of the Battle of Endor, Robetheri controlled the Imperial prison located north of the Great Canyon. The witch had turned the prison's defenders into her puppets and set up a throne room in the late warden's office. She ruled over her people with an iron fist and had plans of conquering the entire planet, but she was overthrown by a group of light side Witches.\nRobetheri had a pale but beautiful face, with black lightning-shaped tattoos radiating from her eyes. She had the hair from her head shaven completely.\nLike many other Force witches, Robetheri was gifted with Force powers such as Summon Storm, Animal Affinity, and Force Flight. A capable warrior, Robetheri wielded a Force-imbued quarterstaff, but she was also proficient with blaster pistols.",
