 "content": "D'krn was a commander in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Commander D'krn was stationed in the Imperial capital of Tatooine, Bestine. While here, he tasked a spacer with retrieving a blood sample from the Death Watch Overlord, leader of the Death Watch on the forest moon of Endor. When the spacers inquired as to why he needed the blood, D'krn revealed that it could be used as a prime clone to create a new and improved batch of stormtroopers.\nThe spacer agreed to perform the task, and went to Boba Fett for help in gaining entrance to the Death Watch bunker. Upon gaining access, the spacer and a group of allies killed Viba, and delivered the blood back to D'krn.\nCommander D'krn is a Non-Player Character in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, players may receive a quest from him, which directs them to the Death Watch Bunker of Endor. Though the quest can theoretically be carried out alone, the game mechanics imply that it is optimal to bring a group of other players to help. This article assumes that the spacer working for D'krn killed Teti Viba with the aid of others.",
