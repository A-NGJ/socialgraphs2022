 "content": "Annor Fash was a Rodian male Chirq Council lieutenant who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Annor Fash was one of the three individuals who ran the Kor Vella chapter of the Chirq Council, also known as the Red Circle Gang, along with Vora Anjek and Vella Corse. He was based in the Red Circle Base, a bunker in the Vella plains.\nIn 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Red Circle Gang following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A spacer working for Lieutenant Cope discovered the existence of the ryll smuggling ring of the Red Circle Gang and the location of the Ryll Smuggler Base. After the assassination of the mayor of Kor Vella Deel Draav by the Red Circle Gang, the CorSec raided the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer eliminated the underboss Ubis Reendorr and retrieved his access code for the Red Circle Base. The CorSec later assaulted the Red Circle Base nearby and killed most of the guards. The spacer used Reendorr's access code to slice the mainframe in the courtyard of the base and learned the identity of the three local Chirq Council leaders: Annor Fash, Vora Anjek and Vella Corse. The CorSec therefore attacked the basement of the Red Circle Base and killed the three leaders. During the assault, the spacer also discovered that the leaders of the Chirq Council were based in the city Doaba Guerfel. The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.\nAnnor Fash was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Annor Fash was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives,\" published on June 8, 2006.",
