 "content": "Tyr was a male Weequay Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Weequay, Tyr was educated by the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force, attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Because he was raised at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Master Tyr did not worship the Quay totem that his people who grew up on Sriluur dedicated their lives to following fanatically. Wearing his long black hair in a tight braid, Master Tyr selected the young Human Initiate Pix as his Padawan.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, Master Tyr took up the rank of Senior Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic and contributed his lightsaber to the war effort. Assigned to the campaign on Thustra, Master Tyr and Padawan Pix joined Master Tyffix and his Padawan, Cal, in attempting to prevent the Sephi from joining the Confederacy. While Masters Tyr and Tyffix were going over strategy with their clone troopers in a battlefield command center, a suicide bomber attacked their tent. While the two Masters were killed, Master Tyr had successfully evacuated both Padawans from the tent using the Force.\nAs a Jedi Master, Tyr was proficient in the use of Force powers, demonstrating his skill at the Battle of Thustra when he pushed his Padawan, Pix, out of the command tent before it was engulfed by a suicide bombing. His ability to sense the imminent danger, as well as act accordingly in time to it, is testament to an aptitude for precognition.",
