 "content": "Norgor was a male Human henchman of Empress Teta system rulers Satal and Aleema Keto in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. In 3997 BBY, a Jedi Knight named Ulic Qel-Droma came to the Empress Teta system, claiming to want to join the Ketos' Sith cult, the Krath. However, Satal Keto was mistrustful of Qel-Droma, imprisoning him and injecting him with a Sith poison, an act which forced Norgor and Aleema Keto to bring the unconscious Jedi to Aleema's chambers to give him a place to rest. Later, after Satal found a transmission from Qel-Droma to some fellow Jedi professing he was there to break the Krath's power, the Krath leader ordered Norgor to assassinate the Jedi Knight. Norgor struck when Qel-Droma was in Aleema's bedchambers, jumping in through the window with two blasters firing. However, Norgor was cut down by the lightsaber-wielding Qel-Droma.\nA male Human, Norgor was a top henchman of Satal and Aleema Keto, leaders of the Sith cult known as the Krath and rulers of the Empress Teta system. In 3997 BBY, a Jedi Knight named Ulic Qel-Droma came to Empress Teta, and was promptly imprisoned by Satal in the Krath headquarters, the Iron Citadel. Satal was mistrustful of Qel-Droma, who claimed he wanted to join the Krath, and injected him with a Sith poison despite Aleema's objections. The poison sapped the strength and consciousness out of Qel-Droma, nearly killing him; however, Aleema, who had planned to manipulate Qel-Droma into turning to the dark side, called off Satal and ordered Norgor to help her bring the Jedi to her chambers. Satal's mistrust of Ulic Qel-Droma was only exacerbated when a group of Jedi, led by Nomi Sunrider, came to the Iron Citadel in an attempt to bring him back to the Republic, although Qel-Droma refused to go with Sunrider. Satal later saw a message from Qel-Droma to Sunrider explaining that he needed to break the Krath's power; infuriated, Satal ordered Norgor to send a squad of twenty men to apprehend Sunrider, and commanded him to assassinate Qel-Droma, instructing him to ignore all protests from Aleema. Norgor struck when Qel-Droma was in Aleema's bedchamber, jumping through the window with two blasters blazing. However, he failed to hit his target, and the Jedi killed Norgor with his lightsaber.\nNorgor was unflinchingly loyal to the Ketos, particularly to Satal. He obeyed Lord Keto's orders without question, even when the potential result was Norgor's own death. During his attempted assassination of Ulic Qel-Droma, Norgor displayed a measure of boldness, forgoing any thought of subterfuge and stealth in favor of simply jumping through the window.\nNorgor made his first and only appearance in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith, a story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J. Anderson and Tom Veitch and released from late 1994 to early 1995. Norgor made his sole appearance in the arc's fifth issue, where he was later killed. In this appearance, he was illustrated by Chris Gossett. At one point in the Dark Lords of the Sith comic, Norgor's name was misspelled as \"Norgar.\"",
