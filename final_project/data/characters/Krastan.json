 "content": "Krastan was a Gran male bounty hunter who wore a burgundy flight suit and was friends with the Balosar Stiper. In 21 ABY, Krastan was present in Sennifer's Beam and Balance on Boxer Point Station when the Jedi hunter Ochi began to assemble a crew to help him in his task to find a young girl for the Sith and then take her to Exegol. Krastan and Stiper were subsequently hired by the twins Bosvarga and Cerensco to help Ochi. After traveling to Nightside in the Therezar system aboard Ochi's ship, the Bestoon Legacy, Krastan, Bosvarga, and three other bounty hunters were sent to the planet Torrenoteer Minor to find the girl and her family. After they arrived on Torrenoteer Minor, the hunters were confronted by Lando Calrissian and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker who also sought the family. During the skirmish, Krastan was killed by Skywalker after the Jedi deflected the Gran's blaster bolts back at him with his lightsaber.",
