 "content": "Clayton Balrog was an Imperial Zero-G assault stormtrooper in command of Spacetrooper Platoon 243-XT.\nClayton Balrog served in the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps as a Zero-G assault stormtrooper during the Galactic Civil War, holding the rank of sergeant. Balrog commanded Spacetrooper Platoon 243-XT, which was based off a Star Destroyer. At some point, Balrog briefed the platoon on a mission to capture the GrimDeath I, a converted Victory-class Star Destroyer crewed by pirates and suspected to be in league with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The GrimDeath I had conducted a series of raids throughout the Woldona system before heading to Galpos II. Originally, the plan had been to stand off and track the GrimDeath I while waiting for support from the Avenger and Terminator but Imperial High Command decided that they could not allow the pirates the opportunity to escape.\nBalrog outlined the new plan to the platoon; their Star Destroyer was to create a diversion while the platoon's shuttle coasted in under cover of the GrimDeath I's engine noise. The objective was to capture the starship along with some command personnel for interrogation, which would be achieved by disabling the engines and then breaching the ship in two different positions; Strike Force One through the lower hull, and Strike Force Two through the bridge.",
