 "content": "\"The Commodore\" was a Human male who was the head of the BloodScar pirate gang.\nHe resided on Gepparin, and when interviewing prospective applicants, floated blindfolded in a pool, using it to dull all of his senses save hearing so that he could better tell if they were lying. He enjoyed food, and Mara Jade considered him insane. While his true name is never mentioned he is known only as \"The Commodore\".\nHe was killed during the Reprisal's orbital bombardment of Gepparin.",
