 "content": "Marakoloon was a male Whiphid bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe second son of a wealthy trader, Marakoloon learned that he would not inherit his father's wealth. So, like many of his species, he left Toola to become a bounty hunter. He disliked the sometimes dangerous work, but enjoyed the money. However, on seeing a display of carnivorous plants in a zoo, Marakoloon dedicated the rest of his career to collecting dangerous species of plants.\nMarakoloon was big for his species and easily recognizable by his carved and silver-inlaid tusks.",
