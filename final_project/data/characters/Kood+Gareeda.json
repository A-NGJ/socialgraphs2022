 "content": "Kood Gareeda was a male Rodian comedian, who operated throughout the Outer Rim Territories during the Imperial era and was one of a string of owners of the Cybot Galactica LE-series repair droid LE-BO2D9, nicknamed Leebo, after the droid was stolen from the portmaster at Esseles starport. Leebo served as the comedian's manager, arranging transportation, lodging and performances. The comedian also programmed the droid with a quirky sense of humor to assist in his performances. The comedian's jokes were not always appreciated and he offended an audience on Rodia with jokes about their leader, Navik the Red. The comedian agreed to trade Leebo to the smuggler Dash Rendar in exchange for quick passage off Rodia and Rendar dropped him on Byblos.\nImperial Security Bureau Commander Maximillian Seerdon, in a report on Rendar for Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, included information from the ISB's Gamma Intelligence Group that gave a somewhat different description of the comedian. The ISB reported that he briefly served as Rendar's co-pilot aboard the Outrider until his untimely demise during the first twenty seconds of their debut mission.",
