 "content": "Deelo was an Aqualish who worked as a street tough during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. During the war, the tough was hired by the Defel thief Gantel Dro to be part of a team which aimed to steal the Jewel of Yavin, a valuable Corusca gem. The group infiltrated the appartment on the planet Coruscant where they had been informed that the gem was being kept. While there Deelo was ordered by Dro to investigate a disturbance, after which the Aqualish was killed by Imperial security forces. Dro was captured shortly after and discovered the whole operation had been a setup, with the man who had hired him to steal gem, Marus Grayson, also being the gems owner.\nDeelo first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game. The source did not clairfy the Aqualish's gender.",
