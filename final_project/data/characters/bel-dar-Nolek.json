 "content": "bel-dar-Nolek was a Human male serving as director of the Obroan Institute during the Black Fleet Crisis and up into the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. The obese man wore custom-tailored suits and walked with a greel wood cane. bel-dar-Nolek was an outspoken critic of the New Jedi Order, blaming them for the death of the Caamasi Senator Elegos A'Kla.\nThe director happened to be on Coruscant at the time of the First Battle of Obroa-skai, which caused some to speculate that it was no accident that the director had believed his world was doomed. When he went before the New Republic Senate, he was blatantly disrespectful towards other worlds, saying that Outer Rim planets could be forfeit, but that \"important\" worlds such as Obroa-skai should have been better protected. When Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya said that no additional forces would be spared to retake Obroa-skai, bel-dar-Nolek said that the Obroan institute would be better off negotiating with the Yuuzhan Vong themselves.",
