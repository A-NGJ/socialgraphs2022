 "content": "Noy Waglla was a female Hyallp assassin who was in the employ of Jabba Desilijic Tiure during the Galactic Civil War.\nWaglla successfully sneaked through the defenses of Colony Four on Ylesia and made it to the dormitories where a few of the t'landa Til priests resided. There she placed small drops of the poison srejptan on the lips of the sleeping priests, killing the large sentients before they could awake from their slumber. She was only one of many of Jabba the Hutt's assassins that would prepare the world for the Rebel invasion that would later be called the Battle of Ylesia.",
