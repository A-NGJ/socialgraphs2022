 "content": "Seleno Chandro was a Jaluku male bounty hunter who formerly worked with the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Following the Battle of Endor, he gained a reputation for capturing Imperial fugitives, which resulted in him becoming paranoid of reprisals from the First Order. In 35 ABY, he was among the many individuals who heeded the call of the Resistance to aid them in defeating Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal on the planet Exegol. After the Resistance and their allies triumphed, Chandro and many others returned to the Resistance base on the moon Ajan Kloss to celebrate.\nSeleno Chandro was a Jaluku male bounty hunter who at one point was a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Following the devastating defeat of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Chandro excelled at capturing Imperial fugitives. Having earned quite a reputation for capturing Imperials, he made sure to avoid contact with the First Order that rose out of the remnants of the Empire. In 35 ABY, Chandro was no longer a member of the Guild and was one of many unaffiliated individuals who answered the call of Resistance agents Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca to aid the Resistance in defeating the forces of the Sith Eternal above the planet Exegol.\nCalrissian and Chewbacca led Chandro and the other volunteers through the hyperspace anomalies of the Unknown Regions to Exegol, where they immediately engaged the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, based there. Shortly after their arrival, the vessels of the Resistance and their allies were disabled by the Force lightning of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious; however, they regained control once the Sith turned his attention to fighting the Jedi Rey. The Resistance and its allies were ultimately victorious and Chandro was amongst those who returned to the Resistance base on the jungle moon Ajan Kloss to celebrate. As the pirate Maz Kanata reunited with Chewbacca, Chandro stood with the droid AL1-L3. He later stood at the edge of the crowd cheering as the Resistance heroes Rey, Poe Dameron and Finn hugged.\nSeleno Chandro was an alien with white skin and yellow hair. His reputation for capturing Imperials made Chandro paranoid of First Order reprisals and so he diligently avoided contact with them.\nChandro was well-armed and carried an A310 rifle. He wore a black outfit that included a pair of gloves and a pair of threat-magnifying data goggles. He flew a modified D-wing fighter.\nSeleno Chandro was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. Concept art of Chandro titled \"Wizard 50\" was created for the film by creature concept designer Jake Lunt Davies. The character was known internally as \"Pointy Chin\" or \"Carrot Head,\" although Davies had a parsnip in mind when designing him for the film.",
