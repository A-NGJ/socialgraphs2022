 "content": "A Weequay male was affiliated with the individual known as the Grandfather of Vice during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry took refuge on the planet Ankhural to repair its starships, with the Grandfather of Vice helping the company avoid trouble with the local gangs.\nThe 61st soldier Brand soon approached the Weequay in a market on Ankhural, matching his pace. She then inquired with him on whether the local gangs on the planet had any trouble with her company. The Weequay assured her that there were no issues or inquiries from the gangs yet, and so Brand paid him with credits, advising him to inform the Grandfather of Vice that she was grateful for the help. The Weequay had a face that resembled a dry corpse to Brand and hobbled when meeting with the soldier, speaking to her in Huttese.\nThe Weequay appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed.",
