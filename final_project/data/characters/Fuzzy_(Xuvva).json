 "content": "Fuzzy was the name of an award-winning Xuvva that was adopted by Yarvok, the leader of the Nova Blades. Krupo, a beast wrangler, lost Fuzzy along with several of Yarvok's other pets after a ship carrying the pets crashed on Dantooine, much to Yarvok's anger. Yarvok threatened to kill Krupo if his missing pets, including Fuzzy, were not found.\nWhen the Commander landed on Dantooine to investigate reports of Darth Malgus at the Jedi Enclave, Fuzzy could be seen with several of Yarvok's other lost pets, Yug and Ol' Cronchy, wandering near the Enclave's approach. Fuzzy had a preference for the crash-landed shipments of fruit scattered in the area.\nFuzzy appeared in the flashpoint Secrets of the Enclave and was mentioned in the Codex entry for Invasive Species on Dantooine in the 2019 expansion Onslaught to the 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic by the company BioWare.",
