Following the Battle of Yavin, she reside onboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. During that time, she was a Rebel Alliance operative, collecting information regarding Imperial activity for Agent Garek. In 1 ABY, Garek encountered a spacer who was seeking to help the Rebellion. To evaluate this new recruit, the Rebel agent tasked the spacer to retrieve datadisks with sensitive information from Adery Shrial and Rund Jesela, another Rebel spy. Although the datadisks only contained Grandma Drake's soup recipes, the spacer achieved the objective successfully and was later assigned to a real mission.\nAdery Shrial appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
