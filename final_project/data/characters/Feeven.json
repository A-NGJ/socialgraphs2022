 "content": "Feeven was a male Rodian passenger aboard Outbound Flight. His quarters were situated on the titanic ship's Dreadnaught-Two.\nFeeven greatly disliked the Jedi, who, by all appearances, were becoming increasingly more controlling as the extra-galactic expedition continued.\nFeeven specifically loathed the fact that, in the middle of the 'night,' the Jedi had come to seize from a family's care their Force-sensitive child. But, in truth, the attempted abduction had been initiated by a sole Jedi Master—Jorus C'baoth—working by the will of his own dictates.",
