 "content": "Druan was a Twi'lek male who joined the Balmorran resistance during the Cold War against the resurgent Sith Empire. He was part of the team that followed Tanno Vik, believing him to be on a mission for the Republic. Their location was given to the Empire by the traitor Brel Orus and almost everyone was killed, with Vik taken captive and Druan left badly wounded. After telling the Havoc Squad Vik's location, Druan succumbed to his wounds.\nIf the Trooper player had Elara Dorne as a companion, she would heal him and he would survive.",
