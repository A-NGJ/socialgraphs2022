 "content": "A Twi'lek female worked as a chorus girl for the Hutt Clan during the Clone Wars. Following the Grand Hutt Council's imprisonment of Ziro the Hutt, the chorus girl and two others gave a performance for the Council along with the singer Sy Snootles. The chorus girl told Snootles of Ziro's confinement following the show, prompting the Pa'lowick to go and visit the Hutt.\nA Twi'lek female worked for the Hutt Clan as a chorus girl during the Clone Wars. At Gardulla the Hutt's Palace on the planet Nal Hutta in 21 BBY, after the Grand Hutt Council imprisoned Ziro the Hutt for his refusal to reveal the whereabouts of a holodiary which catalogued their criminal dealings, the chorus girl—along with two others—took part in a lavish performance for the Council.\nWith music provided by DJ Rangthang, the three Twi'leks danced in unison before the Hutts in the palace's throne room, soon forming into a single-file line from behind which the Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles emerged. The trio of chorus girls knelt down as Snootles began to sing and then continued to dance while the Pa'lowick made her way around the chamber. After executing a synchronized twirl, the Twi'leks struck a final pose as Snootles finished singing and the music came to a close.\nWhile checking her makeup after the performance, the chorus girl was joined by Snootles, and the two remarked on how receptive the crowd was to their show, with the Twi'lek adding that the Council imprisoning Ziro only served to improve their mood. Snootles expressed surprise at her former lover Ziro's presence at the palace and claimed to the chorus girl that she had to step outside as she left to see the Hutt.\nA member of the Twi'lek species, the chorus girl had beige skin as well as red eyes and had tattoos over her abdomen meant to resemble a Hutt's wrinkles.\nThe chorus girl wore a gray dancing-girl costume and stockings—as well as a large headdress—at the performance for the Hutt Council following Ziro's confinement. Adorned with twenty-one red feathers, the headdress was designed to evoke the appearance of her Hutt masters as a way of paying respect to them, with the chorus girl sporting the Desilijic crime family's emblem and the coloration of Jabba Desilijic Tiure in his honor. The chorus girl also had dark makeup applied to her lekku to further suggest a Hutt's features. Leather strappings were wrapped around each of the chorus girl's stockings, running down her legs to eventually form shoes.\nThe chorus girl first appeared in \"Hunt for Ziro,\" the ninth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season, which aired on November 12, 2010. Listed as \"Chorus Girl\" in the credits, she was voiced by Angelique Perrin. Later in \"Hunt for Ziro,\" two Twi'leks identical to the chorus girl appear together, although this article does not assume that either of them is the same chorus girl who performed for the Hutts. The Clone Wars Supervising Director Dave Filoni and series designer Darren Marshall devised the Hutt-inspired headdresses worn by the chorus girls in the episode. The musical number the chorus girl took part in was inspired by the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's opening scene.\nA model sheet by Marshall, which included the chorus girl, was released as part of the Jedi Temple Archives special features for \"Hunt for Ziro\" on the third season Blu-ray release of The Clone Wars. The sheet revealed that the models for all three chorus girls were reused and retextured versions of one of Orn Free Taa's Twi'lek escorts from the second season episode \"Voyage of Temptation.\" Additionally, it was stated that the chorus girls' outfits were similar to the \"slave Leia bikini,\" an outfit worn by Leia Organa in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.",
