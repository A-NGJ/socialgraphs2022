 "content": "Buula Nen was a Chevin male smuggler.\nNen was the leader of a gang known as Buula's Raiders that operated out of a fortified asteroid base called Buula's Rocky Home located in the Vessar Asteroid Field. He was involved in spice smuggling, slavery, and many other criminal activities. He had connections throughout the Outer Rim and used them to find targets for his raids. The pirate chieftain had a group of Chevs that had been enslaved to his family for generations.\nNen was devious and cruel. He enjoyed manipulating his underlings and causing them to scheme against each other. He used this to maintain his control. He was a competent leader and would often take charge of raids when he felt that he could lead them better than his subordinates.\nNen carried a blaster pistol and had a Lambda-class shuttle he used as a personal ship. It was docked in a hidden shuttle bay on his asteroid base.",
