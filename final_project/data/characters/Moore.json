 "content": "Moore was a male Human who served as sub-officer in the Imperial Army until he was discharged during the Galactic Civil War.\nMoore joined the Imperial Army and eventually rose to the rank of sergeant. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, he was assigned to the planet Lok where he worked in the Imperial Mine. During his stay on the barren outlaw world, he got involved with the Lok Revenants and the pirate Nym himself and borrowed several thousand credits from the pirate warlord. When the Empire found out about his deal with Nym he was to be executed. But Moore had friends in the powerful Tagge family who put in a good word, so Moore was merely evicted instead of killed.\nAfter he had to leave the Imperial Army, Moore spent most of his time in the cantina in Nym's Stronghold. Nym's pirates occasionally paid him for information about the Empire's local operations. In 1 ABY, a spacer sent by Jinkins of the Lok Revenants paid him 150 credits for Moore's insider knowledge about the Imperial mine and the droidekas that guarded the facility. Soon after the spacer visited him again and paid him for information about the Imperial Research Facility.\nSergeant Moore is a Non-Player Character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sergeant Moore was added to the game as part of the so-called \"Nym's Theme Park\", released with the \"Publish 3\" on October 8, 2003. Moore's dialogue was slightly expanded when the questline was revamped with the release of the \"Game Update 16\", on March 23, 2010.",
