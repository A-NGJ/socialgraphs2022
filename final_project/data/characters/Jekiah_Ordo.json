 "content": "Jekiah Ordo was a male Human of Clan Ordo during the third Galactic War. He served as an assistant of Mandalore the Avenger, helping her with political matters within the clans, and was later promoted to Arbiter.\nJekiah Ordo first gained recognition during a series of operations on Balmorra. He fought to re-establish Mandalore the Preserver's legacy, but really only succeeded in removing stigma from the Ordo name for himself and his two younger siblings: Rass Ordo and Layla Ordo. He lost his sister Layla during a mission to Belsavis.\nIn 3626 BBY, he demanded to speak with the Alliance Commander, as he wished to know the person who would work so closely with his master, Mandalore the Avenger.\nJekiah Ordo later went aboard the Spirit of Vengeance II to provide security for the convoy, but communications with him were cut off when the ship came under attack by Clan Varad, the Dar'manda, and the Ash'ad. Mandalore sent the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo to help fight off the attackers and ensure Ordo's survival. When the assailants fled following Heta Kol's defeat and their capturing of Clan Cadera's banner, Jekiah Ordo was proclaimed Arbiter by Mandalore.\nJekiah Ordo first appeared in the Onslaught expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
