 "content": "Orbis Keln was a male Human Jedi Master. Unlike the rest of the Jedi Order, who saw the Voss and their Force views as a threat and thus did not participate in the Republic's efforts to gain an alliance with them, Keln was determined to keep the Voss from allying with the Sith Empire. During the Galactic War he came to Voss to uncover the evidence of the ancient history of the Jedi and Sith on the planet. Keln planned on revealing these tablets to the Voss so they'd formally ally with the Republic. However, he was confronted by the Empire in the Quel-Dora ruins and killed.\nIn the Empire chain quest, \"Erasing Evidence\" on Voss, as he laid dying, Keln pleads with the player to preserve the ancient tablets, willing to stomach them collecting dust in a Sith archive. The player can choose to either bring the tablets to Darth Serevin and gain light side points, or destroy them and earn dark side points.",
