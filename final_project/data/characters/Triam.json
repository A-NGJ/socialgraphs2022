 "content": "Triam was a male Kel Dor major in the Republic Army who led the Thirty-fifth Recon during the Galactic War with the Sith Empire. Stationed on the planet Balmorra, he was tricked by the Weequay mercenary Tanno Vik, who \"volunteered\" to destroy Imperial jammers in the city of Sobrik but instead disappeared with the explosives. Havoc Squad, in their search for Vik, spoke with Triam and completed Vik's mission.\nMajor Triam appears as part of the Trooper class mission \"Smash and Grab\" on Balmorra in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011. He was voiced by Tony Armatrading.",
