 "content": "Hab Chanzor was a Twi'lek male who was active during the Clone Wars. He was known to be a dangerous criminal and cannibal.\nSometime around 21 BBY, Hab Chanzor was captured by the Galactic Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals and would be transferred to M'Bardi. While being guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners on attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Knowing that the ship was going to be destroyed very soon, Hab was among the prisoners to cooperate with the Jedi and helped repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid would affect their parole.",
