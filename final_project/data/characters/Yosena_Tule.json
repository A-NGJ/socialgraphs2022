 "content": "Yosena Tule was a Human female captain of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a tactical officer of the Wookiee resistance who operated on Kashyyyk during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nYosena Tule appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, she would have been in some way involved with the 2005 expansion pack, Rage of the Wookiees. However, she is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character, despite being referenced as an upcoming character in an IGN Entertainment news article a month prior to the expansion's release. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
