 "content": "The mother of Garr was an Excargan who worked as an ore trader during the Clone Wars. When the Separatists attacked Excarga, she and Garr's father hid their child while they were made prisoners. After the Republic counterattack, Garr's parents were both presumed dead, and the orphan was taken via the Candaserri to an orphanage on Bespin. Garr believed that they were still alive and would someday come to claim their child.",
