 "content": "Tayshin Maxa was a human female who served as a member of the Cloud-Riders during the reign of the Galactic Empire. After the Droid Gotra caused a gang dispute on the planet Eshan, Maxa learned to survive on her own and imparted her survival lessons to her younger sister Moda Maxa. Maxa wore a repurposed ASP-2 droid faceplate as a helmet. She typically paired with Baroosh Pawk on raids, piloting a Caelli-Merced Halberd-441.\nTayshin Maxa was a human female with red hair and tan skin. Maxa was protective of her sister Moda and uneasily suspected that Callixido Ryss's antics and tendency to challenge her sister to races during raids were a sign of his attraction towards her.\nMaxa was a skilled martial artist and trained with Moda to improve their combat skills. Although Tayshin Maxa was the more skilled martial artist, her sister was the superior pilot of the two.\nTayshin Maxa first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. She was portrayed in the film by Maxine Whittaker.",
