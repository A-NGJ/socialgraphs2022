 "content": "Fitz was the captain aboard the freighter Dromedar. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Nevil Cygni suggested it was Fitz or Toom who locked the hyperdrive aboard the vessel to prevent pirates accessing it and stealing the ship. She and her crew were taken prisoners by the pirates, who were planning to sell them in Cartherston on Keitum, but were later rescued by Lieutenant Thrawn, Ensign Eli Vanto and their companions.\nCaptain Fitz first appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2017 novel Thrawn. She later appeared in the comic adaptation of the novel, where she is dressed in the uniform of an Imperial captain but in the novel she has no Imperial rank, as both Vanto and Thrawn give Fitz orders without anyone seeing it as a breach in chain of command.",
