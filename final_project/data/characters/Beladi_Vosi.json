 "content": "Beladi Vosi was a female Twi'lek Smuggler who was active during the Galactic Civil War. She accrued a lot of debt since childhood, and learned to be ruthless. She preferred to depart with her stolen goods rather than engage in violence, and was excessively charming. Her business partners found her to be a source of many jobs, and as long as they expected betrayal from the smuggler, could even earn credits from working with her.\nBeladi Vos appears as the Friendly Foe template in Fly Casual, a 2015 roleplaying game sourcebook by Fantasy Flight Games.",
