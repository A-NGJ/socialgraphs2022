 "content": "The Seer of the Temple, or the Swamp Seer, was a native of Gap Nine. The Seer resided in an ancient temple, serving as a guardian of its treasures. The Seer was hostile towards the Galactic Empire, because Colonel Icus Traft—who ran the Imperial activities on the planet—had been looting several temples for ancient artifacts.\nThe Seer received unexpected help from a group of Rebel operatives, who were on a sabotage mission. The Rebels helped the Seer defend his temple when Traft and his men tried to raid it.",
