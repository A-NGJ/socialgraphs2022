 "content": "Amminius Goodner was a lieutenant in the Galactic Empire. Admiral Ackbar tasked a Rebel to locate Amminius Goodner on Dantooine, after he made indications of wishing to aid the Rebellion. However, it turned out to be a trap. When the Rebel activated a terminal in the Taikaha Hills to summon Goodner, he revealed his continued allegiance to the Empire. A fight between the Rebel and lieutenant ensued, resulting in Amminius' death.\nAmminius Goodner was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Lieutenant Goodner was a part of a quest titled Meeting the Sympathizer, which was part of the revamped Rebel Theme Park.",
