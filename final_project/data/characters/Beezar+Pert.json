 "content": "Beezar Pert was the famous male Gungan bandleader of the Great Municipal Band and the composer of the \"Symponika Crunchen-Grand,\" a historical work of music known as a symponik, which recounted the formation of the Gungan Grand Army. Beezar lived to an old age in the city of Otoh Gunga on the planet Naboo. Before his retirement as leader of the band sometime prior to the year 32 BBY, he took on the task of training young musikagung prodigy Augara Jowil, who eventually replaced him as bandleader.\nDuring the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the rebelling Confederacy of Independent Systems, Pert was coaxed out of retirement by several other prominent Naboo musicians for a special concert in the Palace Plaza of Theed, the capital city of Naboo, to honor the orphans of both Republic and Separatist forces.\nBeezar Pert was first mentioned in the StarWars.com Databank entry \"Augara 'Augie' Jowil,\" which was written by Hyperspace member Chad Finke through the website's \"What's The Story?\" feature.",
