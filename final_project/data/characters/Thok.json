 "content": "Thok was a Gamorrean pirate who was a member of the gang led by Captain Gwarm. Thok accompanied Gwarm on his search for the supposed lost treasure of the pirate queen Rane Mahal. However, upon arriving on Sakreen, they discovered that there was no treasureâ€”it was merely a rumor so that Mahal's crew could steal the starships that landed and escape Sakreen. Thok and the rest of Gwarm's gang were captured by Mahal, who stole their ship, the Hand of Am-Shak, intending to sell the crew to a slaver.",
