 "content": "Masla was a Human female actress in the same drama group as Roons Sewell.\nMasla eventually had a romance with the future general of the Rebel Alliance. But this romance ended when the Imperials burst onto the stage, accusing the actors of being promoters of a subversive, inflammatory and seditious play. However, Sewell refused to stop performing. The stormtroopers opened fire against the actors, and Roons ran to protect Masla, but it was too late. Masla received a lethal blaster shot.\nIn battle, Sewell would yell her name out whenever he fired at an Imperial.",
