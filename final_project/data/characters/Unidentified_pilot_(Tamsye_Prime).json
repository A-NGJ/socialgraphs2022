 "content": "A male human pilot was present on the planet Tamsye Prime working transport at the time of the Imperial attack on the planet. The man had already setup contacts to escape. Jyn Erso grabbed him to pilot Reece Tallent's starship. Erso was able to use Imperial codes to ensure that they escaped. Afterward, he expressed that they should have saved more during their escape. Erso then told him they needed to abandon the ship, and the pilot told her he knew some junkers. Upon selling the ship, they parted ways.\nThe pilot appears in Beth Revis' 2017 novel Rebel Rising.",
