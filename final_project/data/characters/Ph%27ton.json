 "content": "Ph'ton was a male Bith Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Bith, Ph'ton was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master due to his skills in the force and in lightsaber combat. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Ph'ton took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic.\nDuring the midst of war and chaos, Master Ph'ton was assigned to lead a mission to ensure the safety of the people of Alderaan. As his fleet moved to protect the world from attack, Master Ph'ton was dismayed when Padawan Flynn Kybo absconded with a Delta-7 interceptor and fled the battle, fearful that the young man would turn to the dark side of the Force. Unbeknownst to the Bith, Kybo was off to face a fruitless battle with General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Droid Army, in hopes of assassinating the cyborg.",
