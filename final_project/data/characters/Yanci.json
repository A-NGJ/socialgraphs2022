 "content": "Yanci was a female Human miner who studied medicine and sympathized with Workers of the planet New Apsolon during the final years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 41 BBY, Yanci and her companions, Kevta and Bini met Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, they mistook them for their enemies, Absolutes and attacked them. Obi-Wan was injured in the attack, but after realizing their mistake, Yanci used her medical knowledge to heal Obi-Wan's leg. After he was healed, and the Jedi, along with Eritha had left the mining facility, the Absolutes attacked the mine. Yanci ran for the Jedi, but when they came back, the Absolutes had already finished their massacre. Yanci's friends, Bini as well as Kevta, whom she was in love with, were killed.",
