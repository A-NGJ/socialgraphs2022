 "content": "Baritha was a female Dathomirian who was one of the founding members of the Nightsisters of the planet Dathomir and served as leader Gethzerion's right hand until the Nightsisters were defeated by the Singing Mountain Clan.\nBaritha was exiled from Dathomir's Singing Mountain Clan along with Gethzerion after the pair attempted to assassinate the Clan mother, Augwynne. While traveling Dathomir, the outcasts met a small group of former clan sisters who tried to kill them. The exiles defeated them, but spared one's life in return for a pledge of servitude. This was the beginning of the Nightsisters.\nBaritha was in the Nightsister Stronghold on Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War, during which she recruited an explorer to help deliver two Imperial officers to her for her own amusement, and then capture a reformed Nightsister.\nFour years after the Battle of Endor, Han Solo and Leia Organa arrived on Dathomir. Baritha used a mind trick on Solo, attempting to have him divulge the location of the Millennium Falcon. She said that he looked \"tasty\" from behind, and even tried to claim him as her slave. Soon after, Baritha was presumed killed during the Battle of Dathomir, though some members of New Republic Intelligence believe otherwise, since her body was never found.\nBaritha was also Damaya's aunt.\nBaritha was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
