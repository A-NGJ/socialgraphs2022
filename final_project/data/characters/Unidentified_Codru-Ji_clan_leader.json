 "content": "The female Codru-Ji clan leader was present when Rikkar-Du called a meeting of all clan leaders so that they could oppose Darth Krayt's Empire.\nHaving seen the strength of the Empire first-hand in her travels, during the clan leaders' meeting she argued that the Empire was too powerful for even the united clans, and that they could not stop its conquest of Munto Codru. Rikkar-Du replied that though they may not be able to stop the conquest, they could interfere with its rule by using the Codru-Ji's well-known abilities to abduct Imperial governors.\nThe character's only appearance was a small line in Legacy  13.",
