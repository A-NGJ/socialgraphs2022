 "content": "Tuten was a male Koorivar who owned a shop on Hallitron-7. In 18 BBY, he was visited by Ferus Olin, who wanted to buy a transpirator. Tuten gave him a transpirator, but told the Jedi that he was forced to report anyone, including the Empire, who did not want to call the registration number of his ship.",
