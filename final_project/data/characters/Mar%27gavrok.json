 "content": "Mar'gavrok was a male Flesh Raider warrior who lived on the planet Tython during the Cold War. They made their home atop the Matriarch's Summit, near the tower of the Twi'lek Pilgrims' former Matriarch Kolovish. In 3643 BBY, Mar'gavrok was eventually killed by a Republic-allied individual who was visiting the former Matriarch on a ritual known as \"The Thousand Steps\".\nMar'gavrok first appeared in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic. Mar'gavrok is not a main asset of any quest, but can be killed for loot. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means they were killed.",
