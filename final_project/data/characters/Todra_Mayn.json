 "content": "Todra Mayn was a Human female from Commenor who served the New Republic and later the Galactic Alliance during the Yuuzhan Vong War. She was the daughter of Lela Nalle Mayn.\nDuring the hunt for Warlord Zsinj, Todra was the leader of Polearm Squadron, a veteran unit of A-wings assigned to the Mon Remonda. She participated in many of the key engagements against Zsinj, including the Battle of Selaggis. During the battle, Todra discovered the Iron Fist hiding in a debris ring during her reconnaissance run.\nA little over three years into the Yuuzhan Vong War, Todra became captain of the modified Lancer-class frigate Pride of Selonia. She had received some injuries during the Battle of Coruscant and been relegated to a reserve role. However, she was assigned to escort the Millennium Falcon during its journey to sectors of the galaxy that had lost communications with the Galactic Alliance. She successfully oversaw engagements at Galantos, Bakura, and Esfandia.",
