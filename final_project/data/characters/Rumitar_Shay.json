 "content": "Rumitar Shay was a human male officer who served in the military branch of the First Order. Holding the rank of Scan Ops Petty Officer, he worked on the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacyâ€”Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship and headquarters of the First Order. Despite his rank, he was very young and was technically a junior officer, due to the various members of the First Order being trained for direct combat since birth.\nRumitar Shay was played by British actor Akshay Kumar in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. In the film's credits, the character is listed as Mega-Destroyer First Order Monitor.",
