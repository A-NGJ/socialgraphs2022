 "content": "Idonia was a female Zabrak who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war, she lived on the capital planet of the Republic, Coruscant, where she worked in the Equipment Requisitions area of the Senate Commercial District as a vendor of weapon modifications.\nIdonia appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Modification Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Coruscant. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Idonia was removed from the game along with the rest of the Modification Commendations Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
