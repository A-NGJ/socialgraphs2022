 "content": "1138 was a human male stormtrooper who served in the military forces of the First Order decades after the Galactic Civil War. He and members of the FN Corps participated in the attack on Tuanul, a village located on the planet Jakku. After the attack, 1138 checked areas of the village with a fellow stormtrooper and ordered his colleague to fan out during their search, to which the second complied.\n1138 and his fellow stormtrooper were voiced by James Arnold Taylor and Sam Witwer in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, although it is unknown which actor voiced which trooper. StarWars.com revealed the trooper's identification number and his inclusion in the attack on Tuanul in its article \"From \"Blast That X-wing!\" to \"Traitor!\": The Voices of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",
