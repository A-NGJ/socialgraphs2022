 "content": "Digger was an Advanced Recon Commando and one of a group of clone troopers left behind on Pengalan IV after their LAAT/i was shot down during a full scale Republic retreat.\nAbandoned with his fellow troopers and a Republic accountant named Joram Kithe, they were on their own to figure out how to get off the desert planet. When Kithe awoke and revealed that he had been commissioned as a Republic Intelligence lieutenant, Digger was the first trooper to speak to him.\nKithe was disturbed by the troopers' reliance on proper procedure, and tried to foster individuality in them. To that end, he gave the troopers nicknames. Digger gained his nickname because he was digging graves for the gunship's dead the first time Kithe spoke to him.\nAfter making their way to Tur Lorkin, the nearest village, and infiltrating a starship bay, Tooth and Kithe realized that the village was in fact the site of the diamond boron missile manufacturing facility, not the factory which had been the site of the earlier trap.\nDetermined to destroy it, Tooth faced Kithe and was willing to defy the man's orders to complete his mission. Impressed, Kithe relented. The troopers sabotaged the factory with Kithe's aid while Tooth stole a Corellian ship to draw the CIS fighters away from the starship bay, allowing Joram and the remaining troopers to escape. Digger was in comm contact with him, and heard Tooth go down. Digger took a leading role in the assault on the factory, shielding captured missiles with his body and frequently taking point and making decisions with Kithe.\nHe survived the mission, and would continue to serve with the other survivors.",
