 "content": "Captain Slego was a Zygerrian male who was leader of the guard on his home planet during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends, Slego served as a loyal Captain of Queen Miraj Scintel. Upon witnessing the arrivial of Anakin Skywalker, who used an alias \"Lars Quell\", Slego thought it was suspicious that Lars Quell used a Zygerrian ship and decided to ask him who he was. When Skywalker claimed to have won the ship from Captain Onyx and his invitation to the slave auction in a gamble, Slego threatened him with death, as Quell was not authorized to use this invitation. Anakin shot the Blaster from Slego's hand in no time and threatened the captain with his blaster, but before a gunfight could happen, Queen Miraj Scintel decided to meet Quell personally and said during the meeting that Slego had never been beaten by anyone in a duel before. He then accompanied him to her and felt worried that Quell would refuse to bow to the queen. Slego also worked closely with Atai Molec, the Queen's adviser who, together with Slego, saw how their functions were taken by Anakin when the Queen made him her servant.",
