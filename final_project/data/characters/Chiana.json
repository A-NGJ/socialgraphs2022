 "content": "Chiana was a female Human wife of Tyvar, an agent of the intelligence agency of the reconstituted Sith Empire. Retired by the time of the Galactic War, Tyvar and Chiana settled on Makeb and lived there with their son Peron and daughter Syla. During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY the Empire asked Tyvar to reactivate and provide information that would help in the recovery of Isotope-5. Unfortunately the Hutt Cartel became aware of his true allegiance and set the InterStellar Regulators to eliminate him. Captain Hanthor of the Sith Empire was forced to send a retrieval team for Lurker and his family.",
