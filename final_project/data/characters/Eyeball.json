 "content": "Eyeball was a clone trooper who served in the 212th Attack Battalion during the Clone Wars, under the command of clone commander CC-2224 \"Cody.\" At some point during the conflict, the 212th Battalion was dispatched to the planet Bogoa, and Eyeball participated in a battle against Confederacy of Independent Systems forces on the world. During the engagement, Eyeball detected an unusual amount of static interference on the planet and suspected that a signal jammer could be in operation on the world, and he reported his concerns to Cody. The commander suggested that the interference could be due to the planet's coral, and he advised Eyeball to remain vigilant against the threat of a Separatist ambush.\nEyeball was a very conservative trooper. He was known to be skeptical and quiet. He spent most of his time making formulas.",
