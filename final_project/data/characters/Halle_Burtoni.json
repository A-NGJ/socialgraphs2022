 "content": "Halle Burtoni was a Kaminoan female politician who, having leveraged the production of clone troopers into a seat in the Galactic Republic Senate, served as the senator of Kamino during the Clone Wars. An opponent of Padmé Amidala, Burtoni opposed a peaceful resolution to the conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and advocated expanding the Grand Army of the Republic through the increased production of cloned soldiers. In contrast to Amidala's efforts to reduce military spending, Burtoni sought to deregulate the banking industry in order to secure additional loans of credit for the Republic Military.\nBurtoni was implicated in the death of one of Amidala's allies, the Rodian senator Onaconda Farr. However, the culprit was in fact Farr's aide, Lolo Purs, who tried to frame Burtoni for murder. In the aftermath of Purs' arrest, the Senate voted to continue the production of clones on Burtoni's homeworld.\nIn the decade prior to the onset of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Kaminoan cloners created a clone army for the Galactic Republic on their homeworld of Kamino. On the orders of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, these clone soldiers were commissioned as the Grand Army of the Republic and first saw action during the First Battle of Geonosis, the battle that sparked the war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Halle Burtoni bartered her planet's role as the source of the Republic soldiers into a seat in the Galactic Senate, the legislative body of the Galactic Republic.\nFrom there, she represented her planet's financial interests and became a leading proponent of continued military action against the Separatist Droid Army, as the continued need for clone troopers led to financial gain for Kamino. At some point during the war, Burtoni presented a holographic display of Phase II clone trooper armor, an upgrade over standard clone trooper armor, to a group of politicians that included Senate Vice Chair Mas Amedda, Senator Mee Deechi of Umbara, and Senator Mot-Not Rab.\nIn 21 BBY, the Senate took up debates regarding the cost of fighting the Separatists. One debate was over whether the Senate should fund the creation of additional clone troopers, despite the Republic already being in a dire fiscal condition due to the massive spending required to fund the war. Senator Gume Saam, the representative of the Techno Union, argued for a bill that would open new lines of credit by deregulating the InterGalactic Banking Clan. During a Senate debate over the proposed legislation, Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila argued against deregulating the banks, but Burtoni retorted by saying she believed that such an action was a small price to pay in order to finance the war. The Senate tabled its decision until the matter could be considered further. After a Separatist attack destroyed the power generator on Coruscant, the capital of the Republic, Burtoni put forward the motion to deregulate the Banking Clan. The Senate passed the legislation into law.\nThe deregulation of the Banking Clan led to a new debate over whether the Senate should finance the creation of additional clones. The debate was a particularly passionate one due to the attack on Coruscant, with emotions running high throughout the Senate. In light of the attack, Burtoni proposed that five million more clone troopers be purchased from the Kaminoan cloners. Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan objected to the proposal on fiscal grounds, saying the Republic was unable to pay for it, so Burtoni told him that Kamino was drafting an emergency appropriations bill that would raise funds from the Banking Clan. Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo was also a critic of the proposal, urging that the Senate de-escalate the war rather than inflaming the situation with more troops. During a later Senate session, Organa intended to speak before the Senate in opposition to the bill, but he was injured in an attack by Separatist-aligned bounty hunters. Amidala ultimately spoke on his behalf, offering a strong plea to oppose increased military funding by using her aide, Teckla Minnau, as an example of how the cuts in critical social services in favor of the war were harming the people of the Republic; Minnau's family lived in a district of Coruscant where critical services, such as electricity and running water, were scarce as a result of funds being appropriated for the war. Burtoni reluctantly applauded the address, but she nonetheless continued to offer her support for increased clone production.\nAs the debate over troop increases continued, the Loyalist Committee continued fighting against Burtoni's proposal and put forward its own proposal aimed at preventing any increase in clone trooper production. Senator Amidala gave another speech before the full Senate, arguing that the financial costs for a troop increase would cripple the Republic, and that more clones would only escalate the Clone Wars. Though the Senate had not yet voted, the Loyalists held a celebration in honor of Amidala's speech, a gathering that Burtoni crashed. Burtoni heard Amidala say that it was too early to celebrate when the vote had not yet commenced, which the Kaminoan Senator was quick to point out as something that she actually agreed with the young Senator on. Lolo Purs, aide to Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr, dismissed Burtoni's suggestion that the gathering was a Separatist conspiracy, and Amidala again asserted her belief that diplomacy had to resume. Burtoni said that diplomacy had failed the Republic long before their debate, at which point Senator Mothma urged them to end their discussion. Farr escorted Burtoni, who assured the Loyalists that the war was far from over, out of the meeting. Only moments after Burtoni left the gathering, Farr collapsed and died after his drink was poisoned.\nHaving little faith in Lieutenant Tan Divo, the homicide investigator from the Coruscant Security Force, Amidala and Organa investigated the murder on their own. They suspected political malfeasance and confronted Burtoni and Deechi, also a supporter of increased troop production, in Deechi's office. Deechi and Burtoni laughingly dismissed the implication that they were involved in Farr's murder, as Farr was useful to her politically; every time Farr spoke against her efforts, it gave her a quote to use in her fundraising, so she had no reason to kill him. Deechi likewise dismissed the idea that he was involved but was able to provide the two Loyalist Senators with information about a clandestine meeting at the Coruscant docks that Farr had participated in. Amidala and Organa, who soon left to investigate, nonetheless made it clear that they still had their suspicions about him and Burtoni. Organa and Amidala were attacked on the docks, leading them to further suspect either Burtoni or Deechi's involvement in the murder. The two Loyalists went to confront Senator Deechi and found that he had been killed.\nLater, while the Loyalist Senators were under the protection of Lieutenant Divo due to their run-in at the docks, Purs claimed she was attacked by Senator Burtoni, who had become the prime suspect in the murders of both Farr and Deechi. Senate Guards apprehended Burtoni and she was brought into Chancellor Palpatine's office, where she strongly denied the allegations that she killed either of the Senators. The last thing Burtoni remembered was walking to her office and then waking up in the Chancellor's office. Divo repeated Purs' claim, but Burtoni laughed the allegation off and said that Purs was not important enough to attack. Likewise, she saw Farr as a harmless bug and considered Deechi an ally, giving her no reason to kill either of them. Divo revealed that the poison used to kill Farr was developed by Kaminoan scientists, and he theorized that Burtoni had slipped Farr the poison when she crashed the Loyalist gathering. It was then that Senator Amidala realized that Purs did not drink anything. Because the poison only targeted Rodians, that turned suspicion onto Purs. The young Rodian admitted to killing Farr because of his previous, but later disavowed, support for the Separatist Alliance, as Purs believed he no longer had the authority to represent the interests of the Rodian people. The admission spared Burtoni from arrest, and Purs was taken into custody.\nFollowing the resolution of the murder case, the Senate voted on the proposed legislation. The Loyalist Committee's bill was rejected, while Burtoni's proposal for increased clone production was a success.\nHalle Burtoni was a female Kaminoan, standing at a tall and slender 2.13 meters. She had lavender eyes and white skin. Her regalia included a headband that included jewelry that draped down both sides of her head.\nPolitically, Burtoni was strong-minded and resolute in her opinions, and her savvy politics and powerful connections earned her the respect amongst her Senatorial colleagues and the people of Kamino. As the Senator from Kamino, Burtoni argued strongly in favor of increased clone trooper production and the continuation of the Clone Wars, as it was an important source of income and power for Kamino. Her desire to see the war continue led her to ally herself with other like-minded Senators, such as Senator Mee Deechi of Umbara. Claiming to be patriotic to the Republic, Burtoni was a steady supporter of Palpatine, and would question or threaten those who did not support the war.\nThough her top political priority was the economic benefit of Kamino, Burtoni possessed a strong loyalty to the Republic, putting her at odds with Senators who favored an end to hostilities with the Separatist Alliance. This was to the point that she suggested treachery amongst the Loyalist Committee. One such Senator was Padmé Amidala, with whom she had frequent philosophical disagreements over warfare versus diplomacy. Burtoni saw other Loyalist Senators, such as Onaconda Farr, as beneath her attention, though she did see the calls for diplomacy as a means of increasing her fundraising efforts amongst her supporters. Burtoni's aggressive and intrusive personality and tactics led some of her colleagues to suspect that she was involved in illegal and unethical political actions, including the assassination of Onaconda Farr.\nHalle Burtoni was created for the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, in which she was voiced by Jameelah McMillan. She first appeared in the background of the February 12, 2010 episode \"Duchess of Mandalore,\" where she was seen walking through the halls of the Galactic Senate during a conversation between Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Her role was greatly expanded in the next episode, \"Senate Murders,\" on March 19. Later that same year, she appeared in the November 19th episode \"Heroes on Both Sides\" and the December 3rd episode \"Pursuit of Peace,\" which chronologically take place just prior to \"Senate Murders.\" Some concept art for the character, dated April 2008, was drawn by artist David Le Merrer.",
