 "content": "Ivers was a male Human who served the Alderaanian noble House Organa during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war, Ivers held the rank of captain and was stationed on the planet Alderaan. There he sold weapon modifications to Republic individuals in exchange for commendations, in the market section of House Organa's estate in the Apalis Coast region. He had fair skin, brown eyes, and brown hair, which included a strip of stubble on his chin. While working, he wore armor and carried a blaster pistol.\nCaptain Ivers appeared in the massively multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Modification Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Ivers was removed from the game along with the rest of the Modification Commendations Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
