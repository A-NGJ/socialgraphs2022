 "content": "Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, a Mirialan associate of the Wookiee Sagwa met with the rebel protocol droid C-3PO and Wookiee Chewbacca in Oruba Square on the Smuggler's Moon of Nar Shaddaa. The Mirialan was carrying a message from Sagwa, that he would meet the rebels at the entrance of the Garkata Fighting Arena, which he wanted passed onto them. When C-3PO questioned how the Mirialan had known who they were as they had been keeping a low profile, the Mirialan replied that they had recognized them because Nar Shaddaa was not known to get many visits from gold-plated droids or Wookiees, adding their surprise that the pair had made it as far as they had because protocol droid parts fetched a good sum on the market, much to C-3PO's horror. Afterwards, the Mirialan asked for payment for the information, and when Chewbacca paid, informed the two of the meeting location.",
