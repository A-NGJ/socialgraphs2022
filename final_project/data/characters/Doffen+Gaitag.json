 "content": "Doffen Gaitag was a male Qiraash who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In the year 84 BBY, Gaitag oversaw the construction of a luxury space station in the Besh Gorgon system. The station was known as the Wheel, and was built by Bolzi Design \u0026 Transmogrification, an Ugor architectural firm. Following the station's completion, it swiftly became one of the galaxy's premier gambling dens while Gaitag served as its first administrator. The Qiraash eventually sold the station to the J'feh crime lord Skijid Vrescot, who hoped to use the station to distribute Tirefin spice. During his life Gaitag fathered at least one child and eventually became a grandfather, with his granddaughter Qimberly Gaitag-Delio growing up to become a celebrity attorney.\nDoffen Gaitag was first mentioned in Viva Space Vegas! The History of the Marvelous Wheel, a pair of articles written by Rich Handley and Abel G. Pe√±a that were released on the StarWars.com blog in 2013.",
