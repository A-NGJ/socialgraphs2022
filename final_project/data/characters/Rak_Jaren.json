Nicknamed \"Shadow Hunter\", Jaren had a companion named Kellic.\nRak Jaren was the final name of the main protagonist in the early phases  of the cancelled LucasArts game Star Wars: 1313. Earlier in development, his name was Ty Gerra. His companion in the trailer was named Kellic. This information was all confirmed in a tweet by Matt Boland, who credited 1313's Creative Director, Dominic Robilliard, with the information. No other information is known.",
