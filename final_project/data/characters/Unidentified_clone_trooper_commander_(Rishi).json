 "content": "A clone trooper commander served in the Galactic Republic's Green Company during the Clone Wars. Around 21 BBY, Green Company was sent to the planet Rishi to recapture exonium mines taken by Geonosian forces. Upon Green Company's arrival on Rishi, Rishii Chieftain Gwarrk ordered the clone troopers to attack the exonium mines, but the assault was unsuccessful, and Jedi Master Kit Fisto soon ordered a retreat. While Gwarrk pushed for another attack, Fisto asked the clone commander for his best sharpshooter, and the commander selected trooper 2242. After seeing Fisto weakening the enemy defenses with 2242's help, the commander rallied his troops and led them in recapturing the mines.\nA clone trooper commander was one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He was born on the planet Kamino to fight for the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, the commander served in the Republic's Green Company. Around 21 BBY, Geonosian forces invaded the planet Rishi. They took control of the exonium mines on the planet, since they needed to obtain exonium minerals for their sonic weaponry. The clone commander and his unit were dispatched to protect the native Rishii and were ordered not to attack until a Jedi General arrived. However, Rishii Chieftain Gwarrk took command and led the clone troopers in an attack on the exonium mines because his people needed the minerals to prepare their food in frost times.\nDue to the well-prepared defense of the Geonosians, the attack was unsuccessful, and Jedi Master Kit Fisto ordered a retreat when he arrived on Rishi. Fisto informed the chieftain that the troops were only there for the Rishii's protection from the Confederacy and stated that no attack should have been made before his arrival. The clone commander informed Fisto that the Geonosians had prepared a well-entrenched defense, but Gwarrk insisted on another attack. Fisto, however, formulated another plan and asked the commander for the company's best sniper, and the commander directed him to trooper 2242, nicknamed \"Cooker.\" Soon, Fisto went to the entrance of the mines without informing the commander or Gwarrk.\nWhen Gwarrk asked the clone commander where the Jedi was, the commander told him that Fisto had apparently begun an attack, as he was seeing the Jedi through his electrobinoculars. Meanwhile, Fisto ordered Cooker to open fire, and the Jedi deflected the shots at the Geonosians with his lightsaber. When the clone commander saw Fisto fighting, he rallied his troops and departed in Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunships to assist the Jedi General. By this time, however, the Geonosians had suffered heavy casualties as a result of Fisto and Cooker's combined efforts. The Republic forces—along with some of the Rishii warriors—then arrived and attacked the mines, forcing the remaining Geonosians stationed there to flee. Afterward, Gwarrk acknowledged that Fisto was very powerful; he also acknowledged the Jedi's fighting prowess.\nThe clone commander obeyed the orders given to him by his superior officers—Chieftain Gwarrk and General Kit Fisto. However, despite being ordered not to attack until a Jedi arrived, the commander instead obeyed Gwarrk's orders to begin the battle. He remained quiet when Gwarrk insulted his troops, but after the battle, the Rishii chieftain congratulated the commander on his good work in battle. Like all clones of Jango Fett, the commander stood 1.83 meters tall.\nAs a member of the Republic's Green Company, the clone commander wore green Phase I clone trooper armor and utilized electrobinoculars during the battle on Rishi.\nThe clone commander first appeared in the 2009 Free Comic Book Day comic The Clone Wars: The Gauntlet of Death, written by Henry Gilroy and illustrated by Ramón K. Pérez.",
