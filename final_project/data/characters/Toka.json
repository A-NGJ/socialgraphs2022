 "content": "Toka was a male Mon Calamari member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic who held the rank of admiral. In the year 0 ABY, Admiral Toka was in Tak Base when it was attacked by dark troopers and was subsequently killed in the assault.\nToka was an admiral in the Rebel Alliance Fleet during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. In 0 ABY, Toka was stationed at Tak Base, a Rebel installation on the planet Talay, when Imperial General Rom Mohc tested his new Dark Trooper Project by launching dark troopers in a devastating assault against the base.\nAs the Imperial attack rained down, Toka ordered Rebel Captain Bok to flee Talay aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Grey Damsel using escape coordinates provided to them by the Alliance. Soon thereafter, Toka sent out a distress signal to anyone who might receive it but was immediately killed by blasterfire. Five days after Toka's death, Alliance leader Mon Mothma showed the admiral's distress signal to mercenary Kyle Katarn in preparation for his follow-up investigatory mission to Talay.\nDuring the Imperial massacre of the Rebellion's Tak Base, Admiral Toka demonstrated his selflessness by ordering his friend and fellow Mon Calamari Captain Bok to escape Talay and warn the Alliance of the Empire's new threat rather than risk trying to rescue Toka. The admiral volunteered to stay behind and transmit a distress signal, even though doing so meant abandoning himself to his fate. As a Mon Calamari, Toka had orange skin and yellow eyes.\nAdmiral Toka wore the Mon Cal uniform jerkin during his service at Tak Base.\nAdmiral Toka first appeared in the 1995 video game Star Wars: Dark Forces, in which he was voiced by Denny Delk and identified in the credits only as \"Dying Rebel.\" Dark Forces used footage of Admiral Ackbar from the film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi to depict Toka's holographic form.\nToka was later identified by name in the 2000 comic story \"Sand Blasted\", written by Kilian Plunkett and published in Star Wars Tales 4, which expanded upon the Talay massacre from Dark Forces.",
