 "content": "Tyrral was a male Chiss merchant who lived during the Galactic Civil War fought between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. He worked on Station Gamma, a space station inside of Ord Mantell Space, after the Battle of Yavin, and his shop was known as Tyrral's Mercantile.\nAs Station Gamma had been overran by the Rak'qua, a tribe of bellicose Nautolans, the Chiss preferred to stay in the neutral area at the entrance of the station. There, he sold items such as stimpacks and Tatooine bug juice to spacers who came from the nearby Tansarii Point Station and brave enough to explore the depths of Station Gamma. Tyrral frequently wore a red cloak, a green-gemmed necklace, dark brown gloves, and high-collared brown robes held fast by a large piece of metal around his abdomen. He had blue skin, red eyes, and brown-colored hair.\nTyrral was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011. Tyrral was added to the game in 2005 as a vendor on Station Gamma, one of the areas of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. Strangely, he was dressed with the outfit usually worn in the game by Imperial Inquisitors.",
