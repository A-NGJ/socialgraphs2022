 "content": "Drayneen was a Human female member of the Imperial Inquisitorius.\nWith her charm and beauty, Drayneen was able to learn countless secrets and excelled at pulling information from captured prisoners by making them believe that she was on their side. She was also well known for being disliked by her counterparts in Imperial Intelligence. Most operatives from the organization were afraid of her ability to easily coerce almost anyone.\nDrayneen was not a powerful Force-user, but she made the most of her Force powers in the interrogation room. Drayneen's whereabouts after the fall of the Galactic Empire are unknown.",
