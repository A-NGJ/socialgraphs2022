 "content": "Hen Jamos was a male Human who earned a living as a merchant during the Galactic Civil War.\nA Human male, Hen Jamos traveled the Trax sector transporting various baubles and souvenirs to spaceports and visitor centers in an attempt to make money. During the Galactic Civil War, Jamos sympathized with the Alliance to Restore the Republic in their attempts to overthrow the Galactic Empire. During the war, Jamos transported a group of Rebel agents from Draenell's Point to Entrus during the agents' investigation of the Bissillirus Resupply Base. At the time, he was a slightly overweight, balding man in his mid-thirties.\nIn The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, it is stated that Jamos was the owner and operator of the Trax Express, while the original adventure makes it clear that he merely booked passage on the vessel for the duration of the trip to Entrus. This article treats the original adventure as correct.",
