 "content": "Yerk was a Human male who was alive during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war he worked as a merchant on the planet Nal Hutta, the adopted homeworld of Hutt species. On Hutta he owned a small stall in the market area of Jiguuna, an industrial town controlled by a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro. The stall consisted of a shelves of various goods which he sold, which included specialist types of armor. As all merchants in Jiguuna were, Yerk was expected to pay some of his profits from his stall to one of Nem'ro's lieutenants at the crime lord's palace. Whilst at the stall the man wore light brown armor and a backpack. Yerk had black hair including a moustache, blue eyes and tanned skin.\nYerk first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He appears as a specialist items vendor on the planet Nal Hutta, the starting planet for players of the bounty hunter and Imperial Agent class. Instead of credits, Yerk's items have prices in Nal Hutta commendations, a separate currency used for specialist equipment available as rare drops from enemies or from quest completion. He was removed from the game in update 6.2 of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught. He was later brought back to the game in update 7.1 of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Legacy of the Sith.",
