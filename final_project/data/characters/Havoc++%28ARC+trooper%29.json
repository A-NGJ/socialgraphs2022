 "content": "\"Havoc\" was the nickname of a Clone ARC Commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars as a member of Rancor Battalion. He served as part of the Galactic Republic's military leadership during the Battle of Kamino, in which he perished.\nGrown on the planet Kamino from the DNA of Jango Fett, a bounty hunter who became the template of the Kaminoan clone trooper army, the clone who became nicknamed \"Havoc\" served as a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Republic. During his service, Havoc proved himself as a soldier and was rewarded with a promotion to become an Advanced Recon Commando, or ARC trooper. He eventually came to obtain the military rank of Clone ARC Commander.\nAs an ARC trooper, Havoc was trained in the ARC program, and received experimental clone trooper armor. Havoc participated in the pan-galactic Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance, serving in Republic's Rancor Battalion alongside Clone ARC Commanders Colt, Blitz, and another ARC trooper.\nEarly during the Clone Wars, in 22 BBY, Havoc was stationed on Kamino alongside Colt, Blitz, and the other ARC trooper, who oversaw the training of clone cadets. The commando once stood alongside Blitz in a hangar at Tipoca City where Domino Squad, Bravo Squad, and two other cadet units were present, and listened to speeches given by Master Chief Bric and Commander Colt.\nHavoc then accompanied Commander Colt, Blitz, and the other trainers to oversee the final examination of the clone cadets, beginning with Bravo Squad, and subsequently Domino Squad. After the class of clone cadets graduated, Havoc was present in their deployment to an Acclamator-class assault ship, leading a section of the class while Colt led another. Following a speech by Jedi General Shaak Ti, overseer of all clone training, and a call to attention by Blitz, Havoc and Colt led the recently graduated clones to the assault ship.\nHavoc and Commander Colt continued to serve on Kamino. When the Separatist leader, General Grievous and assassin Asajj Ventress launched their surprise attack on Kamino, Havoc assigned troopers Fives and Echo as snipers. He and other clone troopers then fought off the Trident-class assault ships and the aqua droids. During the firefight, he told 99 to keep away, saying it was not his place. While 99 was running Havoc was shot twice by aqua droids. He survived the first blast that hit his shoulder-plating pauldron armor, but a few seconds later, he was shot again in the face and died. Despite his death, the clone troopers were able to fight the Separatists off Kamino.",
