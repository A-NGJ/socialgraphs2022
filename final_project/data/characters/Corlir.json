 "content": "Corlir was a Hutt with a masculine personality who was the leader of the Vanderijar Hutt clan around the time of the Galactic Civil War. Corlier represented Vanderijar on the Hutt Ruling Council and though he was outspoken and assertive, his influence on the Council was hindered by Vanderijar's aggressive smuggling strategy and run-ins with the Galactic Empire. As a result, Corlir faced heavy criticsm from among the Hutts to step down from the Ruling Council before Vanderijar triggered an Imperial crackdown against the Hutts.",
