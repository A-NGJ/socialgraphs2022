 "content": "Norrion Glidamir was a Lorrdian Human and a major in the Rebel Alliance.\nGlidamir studied in the Galactic Outdoor Survival School and was a member of the Twilight Class. She excelled at the school, breaking the record of a previous class, and then went on to join the Rebel Alliance.\nAn expert in urban survival, Glidamir became a major in the Rebel Alliance Army. She knew that her dean at the school, Barosa Warren, had became a threat to the Rebel Alliance and wrote a report about him.\nDuring the Battle of Archais, Glidamir's maneuvers were essential in rescuing Akul Witig's unit when they were trapped on Tylerin Enbankment.\nGlidamir took part in the attacks on Corint City, and behaved heroically, for which she was decorated.\nSoon afterwards, however, Glidamir died in service to the Rebel Alliance during the early battles of the Galactic Civil War.",
