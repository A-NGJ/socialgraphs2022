 "content": "Oskus Stooratt was a male human who was present in the castle of Maz Kanata on Takodana when the First Order attacked the planet.\nStooratt appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, in which he was portrayed by Mick Fryer-Kelsey. He was only named in LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which adapts the events of the movie in LEGO form. Although the Star Wars-themed LEGO games are own their unique universe, Pablo Hidalgo has confirmed that the names assigned to movie background characters are canonical.\nFryer-Kelsey auditioned along with many of his friends for the film and though he was send a text message saying that he didn't get a role, he was later sent another explaining that the former message was erroneously sent to him and he was still being considered. He enjoyed his time filming Episode VII and is aware of his \"immortalization\" as a LEGO minifigure and this article on Wookieepedia, for which he is very proud.",
