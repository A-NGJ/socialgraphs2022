 "content": "A Weequay was a pirate captain during the reign of the Galactic Empire that discovered the Gigorans after many surveys of the planet Gigor by the Galactic Republic found it to be uninhabited. The Weequay saw the opportunity to use the discovery towards their benefit, and so they tricked an entire home-clan into slavery and sold them to an Imperial labor camp as rare \"Snow Wookiees\".\nOther slavers caught on to the ruse, and were able to enslave more home-clans, since there was little interaction between Gigoran home-clans. The Empire eventually deployed a garrison on Gigor to commence their own operations.\nThe Weequay pirate was first mentioned, although unidentified, in Dawn of Rebellion, a canon roleplaying 2018 sourcebook that is based on Star Wars Rebels and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The book was published by Fantasy Flight Games and was authored by John Dunn, Tom Sorenson, Sterling Hershey, Jonathan Julius, Keith Ryan Kappel, Tim Huckelberry, Jason Marker, and James M. Spahn.",
