 "content": "Gorv Mespit, also known as \"Speck,\" was a Mirialan male smuggler active during the later years of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He sold clothing and other items to fellow smugglers near the entrance to the Senate Commercial District in the Senate Plaza on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant. Mespit sold blasters, boots, jackets, and belts, among which were articles of clothing resembling his own attire.\nMespit's skin was green, and he had Mirialan tattoos, with some visible on the bridge of his nose above his goggles. Mespit spoke Galactic Basic Standard to his customers. He wore a cream-colored outfit with patches of both dark and silver armor, goggles over his eyes, a dark bandana over most of his face, cream-colored headgear, and green pants. He had a blaster on each of his hips.\nGorv Mespit first appeared as the Legacy vendor for the Smuggler class in the 2012 Game Update 1.2 for the massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011. According to Jedipedia's SWTOR database, the game files for his model identify him as having dark hair and green eyes.",
