 "content": "Jono Dunn was a Galacian male who lived on the planet Gala, serving as an attendant to the Queen Veda in her royal palace. He had been raised in a family that had been loyal to the Beju-Tallah dynasty, and would always serve them. Dunn considered his life in the palace to be extremely prestigious, and would seek to retain his position there at all costs.\nWhen Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi visited Gala, they found that the queen was being poisoned by an unknown source. Obi-Wan Kenobi eventually discovered that Jono had been secretly poisoning the queen, under the orders of Beju and Lonnag Giba, in order to maintain his position in the palace. Beju and Giba, with Jono's testimony, were found guilty of trying to remove the queen from power, and Wila Prammi was elected Governor of Gala in their place. Jono was sent back to his family by Queen Veda to learn farming as a punishment.",
