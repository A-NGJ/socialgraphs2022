 "content": "T'kyl was the chief Lucent navigator and scientist on the Crystal Web Station, though she generally delegated common navigation tasks to her staff. She was usually found wandering around the station, observing the different factions and races the station served. She was especially fascinated with technology she had not encountered before.\nT'kyl had an excellent sense of humor and an insatiable curiosity concerning other sentient beings. She was friendly, outgoing, and much more willing to start friendships than most Lucents. She considered Baron Administrator Daran Tal one of her closest friends.",
