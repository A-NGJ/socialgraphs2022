 "content": "The Draay family was, by the time of the Mandalorian Wars, one of the most influential and powerful Human families in both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. However, it had been a powerful business family long before it started producing Force-sensitives; according to Arvan Carrick, \"every time the Draays were knighted, the markets shook.\"\nThey were apparently long-served by members of the Haazen family, as stewards and assistants.\nNotable Draays included Lady Krynda Draay and her son, the Jedi Master Lucien Draay. Krynda's husband and Lucien's father, Barrison, had been a great warrior Jedi who died during the Great Sith War. Krynda's sister, apparently also a Jedi, died in the war as well.\nSeveral sons of House Praji married daughters of the Draay family, resulting in several Praji Jedi Knights like Derrica Praji until the Jedi Order enacted its marriage proscriptions in the aftermath of the Great Sith War.\nThe family was based on the Draay Estate on Coruscant. It also operated the Draay Trust.",
