 "content": "Zikk Keradd was a Gotal male trader who represented an organization. At Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, Keradd was set to sign a deal with the crime lord Jabba the Hutt that would ally his organization with Jabba's own empire. However, the Hoojib Plif, forced to spy on Jabba for the criminal Bralem Mopak, learned of the deal between Keradd and the Hutt when he was brought to Jabba's Palace from Arbra by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, who were unaware of Plif's true nature. After hearing from Plif, Mopak contacted the Gotal trader himself, causing Keradd to back out of the deal with Jabba and instead ally with him. Plif would later be brought back to Arbra by Solo and Chewbacca, freeing the other Hoojibs and fighting back against Mopak. During the struggle, Keradd attempted to escape, but was knocked down and restrained by Solo. Though Keradd claimed he was simply an honest trader, Solo stated that there was no such thing when working with Jabba. Mopak was also eventually caught and was taken prisoner by Jabba, who had been summoned to Arbra by Solo.",
