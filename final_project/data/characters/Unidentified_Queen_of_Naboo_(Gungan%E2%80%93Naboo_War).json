 "content": "An unidentified Queen of Naboo reigned sometime during the Gungan-Naboo War. Because the last heir of the then-current dynasty died in combat and had not decided who would succeed him, the Naboo elected a queen to lead them in the war. She died shortly after the end of the conflict in 121 BBY.\nAfter the death of this queen, the Naboo came to prefer an elected, rather than a hereditary, monarchy. This was the main idea of the later government of Naboo with the rule of ruling in four-year terms and the rule of stepping down after a reign of maximum two four-year terms.",
