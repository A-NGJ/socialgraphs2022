 "content": "Vane Sarpo was a Vuman male trader who operated during the High Republic Era. Originally a mercenary, Sarpo fought alongside the Soikan Velko Jahen in the civil war on Soika. He eventually moved away from mercenary work, operating aboard the starship Rapscallion's Heart alongside the Peasle Clune. During this time, Sarpo was forced into working for the Nihil pirates, being given tattoos embedded with technology which allowed Clune to inflict pain upon him if he did not follow orders. Around 231 BBY, Sarpo and Clune arrived on the Starlight Beacon space station with a load of smuggled weaponry hidden under Jedi souvenirs. There, he was reunited with Jahen, now the station's administrator, but Jahen and Jedi Master Sskeer discovered the smuggling, and Jahen accused Sarpo of working for the Nihil.\nVane Sarpo was created for the The High Republic multimedia project in 2021. He made his first appearance in the short story Starlight: Past Mistakes by Cavan Scott which was published in issues 205 and 206 of the Star Wars Insider magazine. The design of Vane Sarpo was based off of early character concept art created for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace by artist Iain McCaig. Vane Sarpo was originally meant to be a semi-regular character in the comic series Star Wars: The High Republic, but had his role removed in order to make space for more focus on the characters Keeve Trennis and Sskeer and their storylines.",
