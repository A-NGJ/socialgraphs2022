 "content": "Senator Ravein was a Human male who represented Alderaan and the Alderaan sector in the Galactic Senate during the early years of the Galactic Republic. He was the father of Kayala Ravein. His daughter idolized him as a child, but eventually came to see him as a foolish compromiser with the corruption of the Republic. She became a vigilante behind his back, using her social life as his daughter as cover.",
