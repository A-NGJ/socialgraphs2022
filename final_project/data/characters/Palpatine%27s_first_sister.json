 "content": "Palpatine's first sister was one of at least two female children of Naboo aristocrat and head of House Palpatine Cosinga Palpatine and his wife, and sister to Palpatine, future Dark Lord of the Sith as Darth Sidious, Senator of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and Emperor of the galaxy.\nThe Palpatine sisters resented their brother, treating him like an interloperâ€”in turn, he considered them \"well-behaved\" and held them in contempt.\nIn 65 BBY, this young woman traveled to Chandrila in the Palpatine family yacht along with her father, mother, siblings and bodyguards. Cosinga intended to forcefully recover his son from Chandrila. After the starship left the planet, Palpatine slaughtered his family and the bodyguards using the dark side of the Force, leaving no survivors.\nPalpatine remembered the lifeless forms of his siblings slumped on the starship floor every time his Sith master, Darth Plagueis, urged him to recall the murders in vivid detail as part of his training in the dark side.",
