 "content": "Hesper-Inguza was a fish gutter who lived on the planet Ahch-To. As a male Lanai from Temple Island, he was a member of the group known as the Visitors, which was a fishing and hunting fleet of handcrafted vessels that spent most of its time traveling across the ocean to other islands in search of food. Hesper-Inguza and the other male Lanai only returned to temple island once a month to deliver their haul to the female Lanai, who were known as the Caretakers. Upon their return they would celebrate in a multi-day festival. He could play the opah-bladder bagpipes and wore a dark brown robe over a light brown robe along with a woven hat. Hesper-Inguza's skin was a mixture of gray and white in color.\nHesper-Inguza was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release. Despite this, the character still appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film on December 15, 2017.",
