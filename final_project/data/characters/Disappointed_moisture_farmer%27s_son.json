 "content": "The disappointed moisture farmer's son was a male Human child who lived on Tatooine whose father was a moisture farmer. He was fascinated with droids, and became sorely disappointed when his father was not able to purchase any droids from a Jawa clan because one of their number had destroyed the entire stock of droids.\nThis individual only appears in the story Oh!! Jawajawa, published in Star Wars Manga: Silver issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical.",
