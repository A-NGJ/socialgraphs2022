 "content": "Sass Sikili was a Verpine negotiator who spoke at the opening of BastEx.\nSass' job was to talk to outsiders on behalf of the Roche government and he spoke with Boba Fett about an alliance with the Mandalorians, an alliance that was approved on both sides. Sass warned the government of Murkhana that the Roche government would respond with appropriate measures if they continued to breach trade agreements on technology exports. After Murkhana's failing to cease exports of technology, Sass contacted Fett and told him that the Roche government wanted the Mandalorians to take care of Murkhana. He would later be confused by the introduction of the Tra'kad by the Mandalorians.",
