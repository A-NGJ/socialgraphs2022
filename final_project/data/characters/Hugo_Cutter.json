 "content": "Hugo Cutter was a son of Imperial nobility who was enrolled at the Imperial Engineers Academy, but instead of fixing things, he gained a love for demolitions and was disbarred from the academy for destroying equipment.\nWhat happened to him after that is unknown, but he eventually became a demolitions expert and may have joined the Rebel Alliance or the New Republic due to the fact he had had run ins with Wedge Antilles and Han Solo and later joined the mercenary group Red Moons and participated in the mission to Gabredor III. While there he saved the team from walking into a large pit of explosives. He was considered quite eccentric and could very well have been mentally insane. Fellow team member Brixie Ergo believed he belonged in a psychotrauma ward. He wore his hair in a frazzled style.\nHe was present in Nexus City on Entralla with Stormcaller, Ivey, and Sully Tigereye as they planned to disrupt the Lunar Night festivities. He used his bioinduction gun on Rollos to knock out the Gigoran.",
