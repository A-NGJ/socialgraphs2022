 "content": "Sulan was a Human male who served the Galactic Republic as part of the Mantellian army during the Cold War. He was stationed on the planet Ord Mantell during part of the war, where he fought against the Mantellian Separatist Movement in the Separatist War.\nSulan was a Human male who served in the Galactic Republic's Mantellian army during the Cold War, a conflict between the Sith Empire and the Republic. During the war he held the rank of Communications Officer and was deployed on the Republic held planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system of the Mid Rim. Whilst stationed on the planet he and all Republic forces aided the corrupt local government in fighting the Mantellian Separatist Movement.\nWhile stationed at Fort Garnik, Sulan believed he'd manage to shut down the hacking attempts into the Republic communications by Separatists. He was unaware however that hacking had in fact continued from the nearby Talloran village where a pair of data hubs had been built.\nA month after he believed he'd put a stop to the Separatist hacking attempts Sulan was visited by the smuggler known as Voidhound and a member of Havoc Squad who informed him that they had destroyed the data hubs and put an end to the Separatist hacking. Sulan was shocked to discover that hacking had continued and thanked the pair by rewarding them with commendations before red-flagging all recent communications as possibly compromised.\nWhilst at Fort Garnik Sulan wore blue armor including a helmet with four ammo pockets on the chest and a pair of beige pants with knee boots.\nSulan is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. It is not possible for players of the Imperial faction to interact with Sulan as there is currently no way Imperial characters can travel to Ord Mantell.",
