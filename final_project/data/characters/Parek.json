 "content": "Parek was a male alien who was a member of the Gray Griffins, a scouting team that served the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Alliance entered an arrangement with the Radell Mining Corporation, Parek and the Gray Griffins were sent to the Elrood sector, to work for RMC. However, while exploring the newly-discovered planet Alluuvia, the Griffins were captured by The Scourge, a band of pirates that operated in the region. The Scourge subsequently released Parek in an escape pod in the Elrood system, so that he could deliver a ransom note to RMC demanding 250,000 for the release of the rest of the team. The Rebel Alliance dispatched a group of agents to rescue the Gray Griffins and the RMC executive Jameth Todkal introduced the team to Parek in the city Elrooden on the planet Elrood, and the alien explained to them the events surrounding the Griffins' capture.",
