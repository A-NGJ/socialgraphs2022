 "content": "A clone trooper served as a stormtrooper in the Imperial Army around 16 BBY. The trooper was incapacitated by the exiled Chiss Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who donned his armor in order to board the Venator-class Star Destroyer Strikefast.\nThe clone trooper was created on the planet Kamino by Kaminoan cloners. Around 16 BBY, he served in the Imperial Army as part of a squad of stormtroopers that had been dispatched aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Strikefast to investigate smugglers on a nameless world in Wild Space.\nCaptain Voss Parck oversaw reconnaissance efforts against smugglers on the planet, where the Chiss Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn\" lived in exile from the Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn downed an Imperial V-wing starfighter and stole its pilot's comlink, leading Colonel Mosh Barris to order two squads of stormtroopers to subdue the alien, who they suspected had attacked them. Barriss erroneously believed two stormtrooper squads could neutralize the threat posed by Thrawn. However, Thrawn ambushed and incapacitated the clone trooper and stole his clone trooper armor and munitions. Using the trooper's concussion grenades and power packs, Thrawn incapacitated several other Imperial troopers Barris had dispatched. Thrawn subsequently donned the trooper's armor and snuck aboard the Strikefast when the Imperials retreated, blending in with the other stormtroopers.\nAs a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the trooper was a human male who stood 1.83 meters tall and had tan skin.\nThe trooper wore Phase II clone trooper armor, which was stolen by Thrawn to sneak aboard the Strikefast. Additionally, the trooper carried a blaster rifle, multiple blaster power packs, and concussion grenades.\nThe clone trooper was mentioned in the April 11, 2017 novel Thrawn, the first installment of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: Thrawn trilogy. He appeared in the first issue of the novel's comic adaptation, written by Jody Houser, illustrated by Luke Ross, and published by Marvel Comics on February 14, 2018. The trooper was first pictured in the comic's preview on StarWars.com on November 17, 2017.",
