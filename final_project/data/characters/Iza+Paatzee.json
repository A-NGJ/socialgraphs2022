 "content": "Iza Paatzee was a male Zabrak assassin who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Kaeline Ungasan wished to become a new force in Tatooine's criminal activities. Fortunately for him, he encountered a spacer willing to help him during his stay in Mos Espa. Seeing Jabba Desilijic Tiure as his greatest obstacle, Ungasan wished to forge an alliance with Lady Valarian, a powerful enemy of Jabba's empire. In order to gain her support, Ungasan sent the spacer to kill Iza Paatzee, an assassin sent to kill Valarian.\nAs the spacer approached Paatzee, he shouted that he had been set up by Ungasan, and began firing upon the spacer. However, the spacer succeeded in killing the supposed assassin, who in fact was likely working as a patsy for Ungasan.\nIza Paatzee is a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Players who perform a series of quests for Ungasan in Mos Espa must hunt down and kill Iza Paatzee outside the city.",
