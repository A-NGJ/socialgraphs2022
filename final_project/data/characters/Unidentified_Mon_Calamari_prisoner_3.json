 "content": "A Mon Calamari lived on the ocean-covered planet of Dac around the year 21 BBY and participated in the Battle of Mon Cala.\nDuring the Battle of Mon Cala, the Galactic Republic forces and Mon Calamari along with Prince Lee-Char were overpowered by the Separatists and were forced to retreat in the cavern of the Mon Calamari capital city while the inhabitants of the city were taken prisoners and moved to a prison camp.\nWhile this prisoner and others were transported to the camp, Prince Lee-Char showed up, and told everybody not to loose hope.\nThe prisoner was later seen fighting the Separatist Aqua droids along with prince Lee-Char and other Mon Calamari after the Quarren rebelled.\nThis Mon Calamari was a very competent warrior in combat. He was seen jumping onto the head of an incoming Aqua droid and used his spear blaster to melee the droid until it was destroyed.",
