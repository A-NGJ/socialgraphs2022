 "content": "Lis Mohles was a female Frenk assassin who was wanted by the Galactic Republic. When Confederacy of Independent Systems spies on Clabron discovered that Grand Minister Stin planned to side with the Republic in the Clone Wars, they sent Mohles to assassinate him. She fatally wounded him, and then waited for Senator Padmé Amidala, who was undertaking a mission to meet Stin. She injured Moteé, one of Amidala's handmaidens, but was later incapacitated by the senator and taken back to be tried by the Republic.",
