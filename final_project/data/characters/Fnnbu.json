 "content": "Fnnbu was a male Zexx confederate of the notorious pirate Captain Finhead Stonebone, active in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. In 3999 BBY, Fnnbu accompanied a group of Stonebone-affiliated pirates and enforcers in the employ of local crime lord Bogga the Hutt to the desolate Stenness Node planet Ambria, on a mission to retrieve a lost shipment of valuable Adegan crystals held by Bogga's sworn enemy, Jedi Master Thon. To their surprise, Thon refused to fight back once the menagerie landed on Ambria's surface, and the Adegan crystals were soon found. However, Thon's Jedi apprentice, Nomi Sunrider, used a Force power known as battle meditation, hoping to turn the pirates and enforcers against each other. Her attempt was successful, and Fnnbu was the first to fall under the influence of the Force power. Fnnbu flew into a violent rage, attacking friend and foe alike, and within moments all of the pirates and enforcers were brawling with each other. Sunrider then attacked the group with her lightsaber, killing, among others, Fnnbu.\nFnnbu was a male Zexx associate of pirate Captain Finhead Stonebone during the time leading up to the Great Sith War. In 3999 BBY, Fnnbu accompanied a group consisting of both Stonebone's pirate gang and enforcers in the employ of the Stenness Nodeâ€“based crime lord Bogga the Hutt, on a mission to the desolate planet Ambria. The ensemble was sent by Bogga to retrieve a lost shipment of Adegan crystals from Bogga's sworn enemy, Jedi Master Thon, in exchange for Bogga's granting of freedom to Stonebone's crew, who had been captured after a failed raid on an Ithullian ore hauler. The group descended onto Ambria's surface adjacent to Master Thon's compound, and soon encountered Master Thon, who to their surprise refused to fight back. One of Bogga's men soon found the Adegan crystals, although the enforcer refused to share them with the pirates. While Fnnbu and Stonebone argued with the enforcers over who would claim credit for the discovery of the crystals, Thon's Jedi apprentice, Nomi Sunrider, used a Force power called battle meditation, hoping to influence the minds of the invading crew to turn them against each other.\nFnnbu was the first to fall under the will of Nomi Sunrider's battle meditation. Stepping to the forefront, Fnnbu demanded that he handle the crystals, promising to guard them for Bogga the Hutt. However, when the enforcers refused, Fnnbu flew into a violent rage, claiming the crystals belonged to him and attacking both friend and foe alike. A large brawl broke out between the enforcers and the pirates, and eventually pirates and enforcers were fighting beings on their own respective sides. Fnnbu personally squared off with C'borp, a fellow pirate and chief gunner on the pirate ship Marauder Starjacker. While the pirates and enforcers were fighting each other, Nomi Sunrider ignited her lightsaber and attacked the group. Fnnbu and the rest were caught unawares, and Fnnbu was quickly slain by the Jedi trainee.\nFnnbu was a gruff, imposing pirate in Finhead Stonebone's pirate gang. He was easily influenced by mind-based Force powers, being the first to fall under the spell of Nomi Sunrider's battle meditation. He had a tendency to refer to himself in the third person, and also referred to Finhead Stonebone respectfully as \"cap'n.\" He was immensely physically strong, easily tossing around several beings who tried to restrain him as he became violent during the brawl on Ambria.\nFnnbu first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: The Saga of Nomi Sunrider, the second story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released over early 1993 to late 1994. Fnnbu made his sole appearance in the third and final issue of the arc, playing a minor role, and was killed at the climax of the issue. In this appearance, Fnnbu was illustrated by David Roach. Although Fnnbu was absent from the Tales of the Jedi audio adaptation, his lines were attributed to several nameless characters. In 2008, Fnnbu was given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
