 "content": "Saska Teft was an engineer who was allied with the Rebel Alliance during the events of the Galactic Civil War. She alongside Biv Bodhrik were dispatched to Tatooine to both investigate a growing Imperial presence on the planet and to find the freelance member Han Solo, who had disappeared during his assignment in investigating the planet at Mos Eisley, as they were considered among the Rebel Alliance's best operatives.\nSaska Teft had something of a shady past before joining the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, and was also a skilled engineer. She eventually was sent to Tatooine to find Han Solo and investigate rumors of a growing Imperial presence on the planet, working together with the guerrilla fighter Biv Bodhrik.\nSaska Teft was extremely skilled with engineering, and was able to create various traps and devices including an energy shield and an andrenaline injector. She also had something of a shady past, having extensive knowledge of the criminal underworld, and even having contacts with various unsavory figures such as Trandoshan hunters and the infamous assassin droid IG-88.\nSaska Teft is one of two hero characters in the Twin Shadows expansion pack for the tactical land-based RPG game Star Wars: Imperial Assault by Fantasy Flight Games.",
