Together with her teenage brother Theel, Alva and the four were nomads who lived in the Scraplands salvaging waste for profit. During the Galactic Civil War, Alva and her family were ambushed by Savrips on their journey to Fifth Wheel. Wearing survival gear and a homemade slugthrower rifle, Alva and Evun attempted to hold off the Savrips while Theel guarded the children.",
