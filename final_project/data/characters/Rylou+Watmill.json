 "content": "Rylou Watmill was a male human who lived and worked on Lothal. Approximately five years before the Battle of Yavin, he became a target of the Galactic Empire's stormtroopers.\nHowever, a local rebel cell managed to rescue Watmill, granting him refuge in the Haven, a secret rebel hideout created to house defenseless citizens of Lothal.\nOnce rescued, Watmill lamented the fact that he had had only Imperial customers and that they did not pay.\nThe appearance of Rylou Watmill's character model is inspired by the concept artwork of Ralph McQuarrie, as were other key elements of Star Wars Rebels' overall aesthetic.\nThe basis of Watmill's design is the same as that of the character Kane Starkiller, as he appears in the concept art commissioned to accompany the second draft of George Lucas' screenplay, Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars.",
