 "content": "Lieutenant Commander Anson Blazer was a Corellian agent of Alliance Intelligence, the secret service of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He operated in the Inner Rim and through the Corellian Trade Spine, opposing the Galactic Empire. He also joined the Shadow Squadron, a Rebel infiltration unit. During a stealth operation in the Xorao system, they were identified by Kiran Tatch, who opposed to the Alliance's goals.\nIn 2 ABY, Blazer, as a member of the Rebel Alliance Task Force, wrote several intelligence reports of threats to the Alliance. Later, he was again identified by enemy agents, this time while on a leave on Ord Mantell, and he joined a firefight against Imperial soldiers to try to escape.\nA Human male from Corellia, he joined the Rebel Alliance around 2 BBY. He worked as Intelligence agent in the Inner Rim planets and in operations throughout the galaxy, obtaining some vital information for the Alliance. He was also essential for the Rebel activities in the Corellian Trade Spine, particularly in the Bespin system.\nIn 1 ABY, Blazer, a member of infiltration unit known as Shadow Squadron, was performing an infiltration operation on the Kalstan gangsters, in the Xorao system. He and his partners were identified by anti-Rebel Kiran Tatch, who had not crossed paths with them before. When Tatch reported his findings to the Kalstans the operation had to be cut with Blazer and his partners being chased by the pirates to a great cost in equipment. Tatch himself, his part played, did not join the chase.\nIn 2 ABY, lieutenant commander Blazer was one of the few SpecForces Marshals of the Rebel Alliance on, and an important member of, the Rebel Alliance Task Force. In that functionality he wrote extensive reports on potential threats for the Rebel Alliance such as old acquaintance Kiran Tatch and Dr. Sere Lure. Blazer specified that Lure was a threat for aquatic Rebel units but that those same aquatic units might themselves spy on Lure. During this time, he also worked along with Lieutenant Commander Bakki Sourthol, Lieutenants Deeve and Tura Raftican, and Special Agent Tay Vanis.\nOne year later, Blazer joined several other Alliance officers, including Lieutenant Alton Lochner, on Ord Mantell to enjoy a leave. They were identified by Niclara Varnillian, chief gunnery officer of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Pulsar. Varnillian was provided with Imperial soldiers and a firefight ensued. Over thirthy-six innocent civilians and several Imperials were killed in the crossfire and, while Varnillian took two Rebel prisoners to the Pulsar, the others escaped.\nBlazer was a dark-haired Human and an efficient Intelligence agent. He had experience in infiltration missions and he could obtain information on the activities of enemy agents. He was also a firm believer in the ideals of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nBlazer was first mentioned in Alliance Intelligence Reports, published on June 1st, 1995. He was then mentioned again in Star Wars Adventure Journal 8 .",
