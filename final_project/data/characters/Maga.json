 "content": "Maga was a garoo or medicine-man of a Dantari tribe on Dantooine. One year after the Battle of Yavin, Mammon Hoole and Zak and Tash Arranda sought refuge from the Galactic Empire among Maga's tribe. The Dantari were impressed by Tash Arranda's Force abilities, inciting great jealousy in Maga. In an attempt to rid himself of Tash, Maga directed the young girl to \"The Place of Fallen Rocks\"â€”the ruins of an ancient Jedi outpost on Dantooine, supposed to be cursed according to ancient garoo lore.\nMaga's tribe was eventually captured by the army of Dantooinian clones, including several clones of Tash Arranda. Maga was convinced that the offworlder had betrayed his people. However, thanks to the unexpected intervention of Darth Vader, Tash was able to free Maga and his tribe.",
