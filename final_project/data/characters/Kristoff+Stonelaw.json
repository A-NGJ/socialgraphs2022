 "content": "Kristoff Stonelaw was a resident of the planet Vernet, the son of Arn and Emmi Stonelaw, the brother of Yuri Stonelaw, and foster brother of Mair Koda. When the Galactic Empire arrived on Vernet and built a base on the planet, Kristoff was conscripted and began training as a soldier. During his training, Kristoff was indoctrinated into believing the Empire's propaganda, mainly through drugged food and subliminal messaging. When Mair Koda and Yuri attempted to rescue him, they found Kristoff to be unwilling to leave and even willing to turn his own brother into his commanding officer. Koda and Yuri were forced to flee Vernet after their failed attempt to rescue their brother.",
