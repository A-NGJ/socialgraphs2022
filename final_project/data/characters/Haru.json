 "content": "Haru was a female human who lived in Meevai Village on Keelia sometime after the Clone Wars. She was the granddaughter of the then village chief, and had a sister named Saku.\nLocal raider Lord Izuma, who took over much of the deserted Confederacy of Independent Systems arsenal on Keelia, at one point demanded her grandfather as collateral to avoid unnecessary conflict with the villagers. Haru and her bridegroom Asu both volunteered to go in his stead, despite repeated protests from Haru's sister, Saku. Haru and Asu's wedding ceremony took place the night before they were to be taken.\nOn the day following the wedding, Haru and Asu turned themselves in to Izuma. Saku and others had secretly organized an ambush on the raiders, but their plans were foiled. When Izuma was ready to execute Saku for being the leader, the Jedi F intervened and saved her. F's companion Valco destroyed Izuma's ship, thus disabling his B1-series battle droids. In the ensuing chaos, Izuma's associates fled. Izuma then took Haru as hostage. In a swift move, F struck down the raider, and saved Haru and the rest of the villagers.\nSometime later, Haru and the rest of the villagers thanked F for her help, and said their farewell to F as the Jedi left the planet.\nHaru first appeared in the Star Wars: Visions short film \"The Village Bride.\" She was voiced by Megumi Han in the original Japanese audio, and by Nichole Sakura in the English dub.",
