 "content": "Janq Paramexor was Guildmaster of House Paramexor, a house of the Bounty Hunters' Guild.\nParamexor was once an arrogant military officer with a high opinion of himself. However, during a duel, he was severely injured and lost the use of his legs. Forced to live the rest of his life in a repulsor chair, Janq nearly committed suicide. His comrades managed to convince him that he still had skills that could be put to use. Janq rebuilt his life and eventually formed the Paramexor Guild of Hunters.\nParamexor presided over the trial of bounty hunter Reson Nath. Prefect Adar had accused Nath of a variety of crimes and she was to be punished as according to Guild rules. On learning that the trial involved a battle with Nath, Adar quickly dropped the charges. However, Moff Gorliz, who had bet on the outcome with Paramexor, ordered Adar to participate.\nParamexor was also good friends with bounty hunter Kal-tan-shi. Even when Kal-tan-shi left House Paramexor, both of them continued to be friends and dining together.",
