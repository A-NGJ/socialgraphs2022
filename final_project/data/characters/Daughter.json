 "content": "The Daughter was a female Force wielder native to the ethereal world of Mortis. Like her family, the Father and the Son, the Daughter was a being who possessed a unique connection to the Force. As the counterpart of her brother, who embodied the dark side of the Force, the Daughter was a paradigm of the light side while their patriarch maintained and channeled the balance between them. With their Father's days numbered, the Force wielders lured the Chosen One, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Mortis in order to test his potential. It was the Father's hope that Skywalker would take his place on Mortis; although the Daughter remained obedient to the will of her Father, the Son plotted to escape into the galaxy with Skywalker's help.\nThe siblings confronted each other in the Son's cathedral until the Father intervened, only to be overpowered by his Son who grew stronger with the dark side as a result of the Clone Wars. Ultimately, the Daughter sacrificed her life in order to protect their Father from the Son, who tried to kill him using the Dagger of Mortis. Though mortally wounded, the Daughter used the last of her powers to help Skywalker save his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Afterward, she was buried with the Dagger that ended her life. Prior to his own death, the Son visited his late sister's tomb to retrieve the weapon.\nThe Daughter was a female individual of the enigmatic Force wielder species, and a member of the family known as the Ones. She was the daughter of the patriarch of the family, the Father, and the sister of the Son. While her brother was the embodiment of the dark side of the Force, the Daughter was the personification of the light side of the Force and embodied compassion, serenity, love, and selflessness. Meanwhile, the Father acted as a balancing force between the two siblings and sought to keep the galaxy safe from their unpredictable consequences, as they would naturally clash as opposites.\nDue to their Force powers, the Father brought both the Daughter and her brother to the Wild Space world of Mortis. There, by abandoning the material world, the Father was able to control both the Daughter and the Son and keep them both in balance. After the Daughter and her family adopted the Mortis realm as their new home, few eventually remained with knowledge of their existence.\nWhile Mortis acted as both a sanctuary and a prison for the family, the realm was believed to be have been origin point of the Force itself, acting as a conduit for all things connected through it, which allowed the Father to keep watch over the balance in the Force throughout the galaxy. Throughout this time, the Daughter remained loyal to the father and the light side while her brother struggled with the dark side and his desire to usurp the Father's authority.\nDuring the Clone Wars, news reached the Ones that the Chosen One, a prophesied Jedi legend, had been found. With the Father growing old and struggling to maintain a balance between his two children, he decided to bring this Chosen One to Mortis so that he could assume that role. This Chosen One turned out to be Anakin Skywalker, a promising Jedi Knight in the Jedi Order and a well-respected Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. Both the Daughter and the Son were made aware of this decision. While the Son sought to corrupt the Chosen One, the Daughter dutifully obeyed the Father's instructions to bring him to their monastery.\nUsing a distress signal embedded with an ancient Jedi code, the Father lured Skywalker and his Jedi companions Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano to Mortis. After the Jedi's shuttle landed, the Daughter approached the three visitors. She then asked Anakin whether he was the \"One\" and offered to take them to the Father. Anakin and his Jedi companions reluctantly accepted the Daughter's offer. However, while they were walking along a rock cliff, a rock collapsed and separated the Daughter and Skywalker from Kenobi and Ahsoka. Realizing that this was the doing of the Son, the Daughter instructed Anakin to wait. Against the Daughter's advice, Skywalker opted to follow her; leaving Kenobi and Ahsoka behind to return to the ship and call for help.\nLater that night, the Daughter and the Son transformed into a griffin and gargoyle respectively and kidnapped both Kenobi and Ahsoka. The following morning, the Father led Skywalker to an arena where the Daughter and the Son landed with their Jedi captives. In order to test whether Skywalker was the Chosen One, the Father ordered Anakin to choose which of the captives to save from his children. However, Skywalker used his Force powers to force the Daughter and the Son to release his Jedi comrades and to revert back to their humanoid forms. The Father then realized that Skywalker was indeed the Chosen One and offered him the opportunity to assume his place. However, Skywalker, who did not grasp the full gravity of the situation, declined that offer and chose to return with his fellow Jedi to the wider galaxy.\nBefore Skywalker and his Jedi companions could depart Mortis on their shuttle, the Son kidnapped Ahsoka and spirited her away to his cathedral. Later, the Daughter and the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi were present at her father's monastery when the Son gave in to the dark side and attacked the Father with Force lightning, greatly wounding him. Upon hearing the commotion, the Daughter ran to nurse her wounded Father. While at her Father's sickbed, Kenobi tried to implore her to assist the Jedi in stopping the Son before he could Mortis. However, the Daughter said that it was not her brother's nature to be \"dark\" and refused to lay a hand against the Son.\nWhen Kenobi suggested that she and Anakin should combine their Force powers to stop the Son, the Daughter instead led him to a cavern which contained an altar holding the Dagger of Mortis, a powerful weapon capable of killing the Ones. She told Kenobi that this was the only weapon that could stop her brother. The Daughter and Kenobi then traveled together to the Son's cathedral to confront him. They encountered the Son in his inner sanctum but her brother was unfazed and instead pointed his sister and Kenobi to the scene of Anakin fighting against Ahsoka, who had been corrupted by the Son. While Kenobi and Skywalker tangled with the corrupted Ahsoka, the Daughter and the Son clashed in a mighty duel, with the Daughter employing her mastery of telekinesis against her brother's Force lightning and even briefly clashing in their animal forms.\nThe Daughter and her brother's fight was interrupted by the arrival of the Father, who used his Force powers to forcibly separate the two belligerents and throw them among the Jedi. However, the Son was still not subdued and attacked the Father. During the fighting, the corrupted Ahsoka managed to obtain the Dagger of Mortis and passed it to the Son, who attempted to kill the Father. Having served her usefulness, the Son then \"killed\" Ahsoka by tapping the life force out of her forehead. With the Jedi preoccupied, the Son then attempted to stab his Father with the Dagger. However, the Daughter stepped in between them and took the full force of the blade, mortally wounding herself. Horrified at having killed his own sister, the Son fled the scene.\nIn her final moments, the Daughter gave permission for the Father to drain her remaining powers into Ahsoka, healing and restoring the young Padawan back to life and bringing her back to the light side, allowing her to die content knowing that she had saved an innocent life. The Daughter's death had the catastrophic effect of upsetting the balance of the Force on Mortis, along with greatly weakening the light within the wider galaxy. As a result, the planet began to descend into darkness. In the wake of the Daughter's death, the Father and the Jedi resolved not to let the Son get access to the Jedi's shuttle and return to the galaxy. The Father also buried the Daughter in a crypt with the Dagger of Mortis, distraught as while he had accepted that he might have to kill his son, he had never intended for her to die.\nLater, the Son managed to win over Anakin Skywalker by showing him a Force vision of the future at the Well of the Dark Side. Believing the Jedi to be an obstacle to peace in the galaxy and that the Son could help him undo that vision, Skywalker agreed to help the Son to return to the galaxy. Meanwhile, the Son visited his sister's tomb and took the Dagger of Mortis with the intent of killing the Father once and for all. However, they were stopped by the Father who erased Anakin's memories of the future. Shortly later, both the Son and the Father were killed in a climatic confrontation at the Mortis monastery by Skywalker. The deaths of the Ones both restored balance to the Force and destroyed the planet Mortis. Meanwhile, the Jedi were returned back to the wider galaxy.\nIn 0 BBY, an excavation of the Jedi temple on Lothal occurred. The excavation was conducted by forces of the Galactic Empire and led by Minister Veris Hydan under the direct orders of the Galactic Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Eventually a mural depicting the Daughter, alongside the Father and the Son, was discovered on the wall of the temple. Sometime after the excavation's start, Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger and the Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, who acted as agents of the Rebel Alliance, infiltrated the dig site. Wren and Bridger studied the mural that depicted the Mortis gods, hoping to discern a method of opening the temple. Placing his hand onto the Daughter's encircled hand, Bridger used the Force to activate the mural. The painting lit up and the Daughter's head moved to face her Father while the words \"We are the ones that guard the power. We are the middle, the beginning, and the end\" began to emanate from the painting in the Daughter's voice. Proceeding this, the depiction of the Father moved, opening a gateway for Ezra. As Imperial forces closed in on Bridger, Sabine implored him to jump through the portal, allowing him to escape capture.\nThe gateway led to the World Between Worlds, a mystical plane of existence that existed outside time and space, and included gateways to many points in time. In this realm, Bridger could hear the echoes of many voices reverberating from across time, including the Daughter's. Eventually, Ezra returned to Lothal and used the Force on the Son's hand to close the gateway, hoping to keep the power of the World Between Worlds out of the Empire's grasp. The portraits of the Son and the Daughter subsequently sank with dejected expressions as the temple was destroyed.\nThe convor Morai had a spiritual connection to the Daughter, as well as a strong bond to Ahsoka Tano. Information and illustrations pertaining to the Daughter and her family were depicted on a set of maps drawn by Ithorian artist Gammit Chond. The map relating to Mortis featured information about the Mission to Mortis that the Daughter lost her life in, and was stored in the Shadow Stacks in the Graf Archive on the moon Orchis 2 until a lucky student exhumed the set. A journal which also featured information and illustrations of the Daughter, the Mortis Gods, and the Force-wielders as a whole was also stored in the Graf Archive. The journal, that was speculated to be written by Chond, had faded into obscurity until a team led by archive droid TR-33NA rediscovered it.\nThe Daughter was a selfless, compassionate and humble Force-wielder who aligned herself with the light side of the Force. She loved both her Father and her brother, the Son. She shared the Father's goals of maintaining the balance of the Force on both Mortis and the wider galaxy. She strongly opposed the dark side of the Force but still loved her brother despite his obsession with the dark side and pleaded for the Father not to hold it against him. The Daughter's selfless devotion to her family and righteousness led her to lay down her own life to save the Father and to use her remaining energy to bring the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano back to life. In her humanoid form, she stood at 2.13 meters tall and had teal hair and green eyes.\nAs a member of the Force wielder species, the Daughter inherited a strong connection to the Force and had no fixed physical form, often alternating between a statuesque humanoid woman and a large griffin that was capable of flight. The Daughter could also use Tutaminis, one that was capable of matching The Son's Force lightning. She could absorb, deflect, and redirect force lightning with this ability. She was also powerful in the use of telekinesis, as shown when she was able to force The Son up and bring him back down on the ground. She could also use the Force to hold The Son in place. The Daughter was also able to use powerful Force pushes, as show when she caused the Son to go out of his Gargoyle form with one push. The Daughter could also fly, and seemed to have a spiritual connection with the bird, Morai. When sacrificing herself, the Daughter was able to use the Force to enhance her physical speed, reaching the Son before he could strike their father down. At the end of her life, the Daughter transferred her life force into Ahsoka Tano by using Anakin Skywalker as a conduit, resurrecting the Jedi apprentice from the dead. One known weapon capable of harming her was the Dagger of Mortis. When The Son accidentally stabbed her with it she become mortal and died.\nThe Daughter and the story of Mortis were created by George Lucas, the original creator of Star Wars. She debuted in \"Overlords,\" the fifteenth episode of the third season of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The episode was directed by Steward Lee, written by Christian Taylor, and first aired on January 28, 2011. The Daughter was voiced by Adrienne Wilkinson, who had previously provided her voice as Maris Brood in the Star Wars Legends video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed alongside the Son's voice actor Sam Witwer, who voiced Galen Marek.",
