 "content": "A Human female smuggler was active in the Free Zone at the Wild Space shadowport Asylum in 3631 BBY. By that year, a thug in the Free Zone requested an item from her. Though the smuggler was able to obtain it, smuggling it out of Breaktown on the Wild Space planet Zakuul resulted in the death of a man named Rhax, whom she counted among her best associates.\nIn that year, the smuggler was asked by the thug if she had acquired what he sought. She replied that she did, but on account of Rhax's death she would charge extra for it. The thug offered to give the smuggler enough credits for whiskey, to which she replied that she desired enough to purchase whiskey of better quality than what could be found in the Free Zone.",
