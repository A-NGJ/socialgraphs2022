 "content": "Q'kal was a Human male bounty hunter who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, Q'kal was one of the bounty hunters to attend the Great Hunt on Dromund Kaas. However, when the Huntsmaster and Assistant Huntsmaster Lek announced that the competitors for the final melee were required to collect three bounties on Dromund Kaas, Q'kal feared going up against the Sith and Imperials and decided to drop out. He advised a young bounty hunter to do likewise.",
