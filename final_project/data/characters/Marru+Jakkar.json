At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Jakkar traveled to the planet Geonosis to attend a party held by the Geonosian noble Duke Piddock. Jakkar concealed her true affiliation from the other guests at the party by using a cover story that she had an interest in Geonosian culture and was on Geonosis to purchasee antiques to conceal her true affiliation from the other guests, and during the event she held a private meeting with Piddock.\nJakkar was a slender woman and she had a cold, sophisticated persona and she was cordial and polite in her interactions with others. She found alien species to be fascinating but also held a strong dislike for droids.",
