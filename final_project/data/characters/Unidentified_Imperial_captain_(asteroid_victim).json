 "content": "A Human male captain served with the Imperial Navy, commanding an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer during the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. During the search for the Rebel freighter Millennium Falcon in the Hoth asteroid field, the Captain appeared in holographic form during a conference of twenty Imperial battleship commanders also participating in the search. As the conference, led by the Dark Lord Darth Vader, progressed, the bridge tower of the Captain's Star Destroyer was hit by a massive asteroid, obliterating the ship and killing him.\nIn 3 ABY, a fair-skinned \nHuman male Imperial captain commanded one of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyers participating in the search for Han Solo's YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon, in the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth. Solo, along with Princess Leia Organa, his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca, and the protocol droid C-3PO, had fled the Rebels' Echo Base on Hoth and, due to a broken hyperdrive, were forced to hide within one of the many asteroids in the Hoth asteroid field to avoid being captured by the Imperial Death Squadron.\nThe Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader desired to capture the crew of the Millennium Falcon to use them as bait for capturing his son, Luke Skywalker. In an attempt to find the Falcon, Vader ordered Death Squadron into the asteroid field, and many Star Destroyers suffered heavy casualties under the continual bombardment of asteroids.\nThis captain was present in holographic form during a conference of twenty other battleship fleet commanders aboard the Star Dreadnought Executor, Vader's flagship, to discuss the whereabouts of the Millennium Falcon. During the conference, the bridge tower of this captain's Star Destroyer was hit by a large hurdling asteroid. The collision resulted in both his death and the destruction of his ship as the captain's holographic image faded quickly away.\nThe captain wore the standard-issue Imperial officer's uniform during his service aboard his Star Destroyer in 3 ABY.\nThis unidentified Star Destroyer captain first appeared in the 1980 novelization of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. In the film, the officer is portrayed by Effects Cameraman Jim Veilleux, who was uncredited for the role, and is only briefly seen in holographic form.",
