 "content": "Didjoa was a Corellian Human woman who was a friend of the scientist Bant'ena Fhernan. During the Clone Wars, Fhernan was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and was subsequently forced to work for them by claiming that they would kill Fherman's friends and family, including Didjoa, if she refused to co-operate with them. The Separatists subsequently placed Didjoa under surveillance and Fhernan later showed a hologram of her friend to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. When the Republic learned the location of the hostages, she was brought to safety.",
