 "content": "CT-66-3233 was a clone cadet who served in Bravo Squad, a training unit on Kamino, during the Clone Wars. He was marked with a one on his clone training armor.\nCT-66-3233 was a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. Early during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, CT-66-3233 was attached to Bravo Squad, a squad of clone cadets training on Kamino. During their time training, Bravo Squad managed to complete the practice examination in record time. When ARC trooper Commander Colt arrived to watch over the final exams, Bravo Squad, along with Domino Squad and two other units, were called to a hangar in Tipoca City Military Complex for Colt's speech. During the speech, Colt selected Bravo Squad for the final test first due to their record time in completing the practice test.\nCommencing the Citadel Challenge version THX variable 1138, CT-66-3233 and CT-66-3232 took the left flank while CT-66-3238, CT-66-3339, and CT-27-3555 took the right flank. CT-66-3233 provided cover fire while the rest of his teammates moved forward, taking out the training battle droids. As the entire squad began moving forward, CT-66-3233 took out a training BX-series droid commando in close proximity. As Bravo Squad moved forward, CT-27-5555 commented that he and Domino Squad were better as they watched from above. Eventually, CT-66-3339 told CT-66-3238 to move forward to the citadel, and was able to rappel up and capture the light post, completing the exam. While exiting the arena, CT-66-3233, who was the first in line, mocked the incoming Domino Squad.\nCT-66-3233, as a clone of Jango Fett, was 1.83 meters tall, had tan skin, black hair, and was a male human born on Kamino. As he belonged to Bravo Squad who were considered exemplary, CT-66-3233 unprovokingly mocked Domino Squad, a unit who had a rough record.\nCT-66-3233 was able to coordinate effectively with the rest of his teammates, which helped them to pass the final exam. During the exam, he was able to provide cover fire for his squadmates.\nCT-66-3233 was equipped with clone training armor, sporting the red coloring of his unit, the number one on his chest plate and left shoulder armor, had his designation on his left leg, and utilized a DC-15A blaster carbine with non-lethal bolts and an ascension cable.\nThis Bravo Squad cadet's identification number was first depicted in the episode \"Clone Cadets\" of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It says 66-3233, and the prefix CT- was predetermined. This way of determining identification numbers was proved with the troopers in Domino Squad.",
