 "content": "Hirka was a Human female CorSec officer who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Hirka held the rank of sergeant in the Corellian Security Force and was based in the city of Coronet on Corellia.\nIn 1 ABY, the CorSec received reports of hostile Clone Wars-era battle droids active in the Bindreg Hills. A group led by Lieutenant Varias, including Sergeant Hirka, Officers Savas, Kener and Mener and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated droid factory, presumably built in secret by the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by IG-88 for his project of Droid Revolution.\nUpon their arrival, Sergeant Hirka and her team was sent into the factory to scout out the place. However, after their initial transmissions, the CorSec scouts encountered hostile battle droids that patrolled the facility. The droids cut off Hirka's line of retreat and the CorSec group was forced to fortify a small room while waiting for reinforcements. In the meantime, Lieutenant Varias recruited independent spacers to assist the CorSec in the droid factory. When Sergeant Hirka's group was reported missing, Varias dispatched a spacer to locate them. Fortunately, the spacer was able to rescue the scout team, trapped since a while in the fortified room. Lieutenant Varias was indeed very relieved that Sergeant Hirka and her group had survived. Eventually, the CorSec would successfully manage to shut down the Corellia Droid Factory.\nSergeant Hirka was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sergeant Hirka was added to the game as part of the \"Corellian Droid Factory\" arc with the release of the \"Game Update 12\", on August 10, 2009.",
