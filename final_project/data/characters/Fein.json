 "content": "Fein was a Human male smuggler who worked for Talon Karrde. He was present at the Whistler's Whirlpool Tapcafe on Trogan, when Karrde called a meeting of smuggler chiefs. Fein fought against the Imperial troops that attacked the smugglers, and emerged from the battle unscathed.\nHe was recruited by Karrde from a swoop gang in the Outer Rim Territories.\nFein was well respected, but not very liked due to his abrasive and cold personality. He rarely spoke to others.",
