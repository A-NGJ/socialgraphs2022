 "content": "Flangolial was a Human female scientist and Darkwalker criminal who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Flangolial was the Chief of Science of the Darkwalker gang on Naboo. She operated from a cave near Dee'ja Peak with Bloodlord Trienial. In 1 ABY, Trienial's group shot down a shuttle that crashed in the Gallo Mountains. The Darkwalkers plundered the wreckage and stole a bio-scanner. Their objective was to use the bio-scanner to make a bomb that would remain inert until its target with the programmed bio-signature came nearby. A spacer working with the scientist Tanoa Vills then raided the Darkwalker Cave to recover the stolen bio-scanner. Bloodlord Trienial and Flangolial were both killed during the assault.\nFlangolial was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Flangolialk was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\", released with the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
