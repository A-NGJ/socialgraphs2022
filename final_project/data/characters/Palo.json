 "content": "Palo was a Human male from Naboo who served as a member of the Legislative Youth Program, along with Padmé Amidala. He and twelve-year-old Padmé had a brief relationship. However, they went their separate ways when Palo became an artist and Padmé continued in politics, although he never fully got over her.\nIn 22 BBY, Amidala talked about Palo to her future husband, Anakin Skywalker, teasing the young Jedi by describing her first love in details with a suggestive tone of voice.\nFor a time after 0 BBY, Palo was living in Moenia, continuing his career as an artist.\nIn the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, Palo could be found at a gazebo in the city of Moenia on Naboo at the coordinates 4765, -4797. He gave three completable missions, but the text for them was bugged. He was eventually removed from the game by its developers relatively early in the game's lifespan.\nThe character was originally set to return as Padmé Amidala's love interest for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Senate Spy\". However, this idea was eventually abandoned when the crew remembered that Palo left politics to become an artist . The show's creators also felt that the relationship between Amidala and the \"Senate Spy\" character had to be more recent than the one between her and Palo, so that the theme of Anakin Skywalker's jealousy would be better supported. Palo was thus replaced by a new character, Rush Clovis.",
