 "content": "Hamnet was a crime boss whose illegalities were sufficiently under cover that he was able to double as a respectable and wealthy businessman who enjoyed the trappings of success. The illegal activities were performed on his behalf by Wesson DeLameter, his personal bodyguard.\nHe was overweight and shrewd, his only foible being his daughter Icomia Hamnet for whom he would do anything.\nHamnet had booked passage on the Ananuru Express when the secret Imperial RNA brainwashing virus datatape was up for auction by Hakon deVille. He met up with a group of Rebels on board to see if they could help him acquire the datatape, though they refused as they had already agreed to acquire it for the Rebel Alliance.",
