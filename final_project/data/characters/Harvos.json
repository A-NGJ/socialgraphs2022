 "content": "Harvos was a male Nelvaanian scout from Rokrul village on the Outer Rim planet Nelvaan. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Confederacy-aligned Techno Union built a laboratory on Nelvaan that drained the planet of geothermal energy, causing a perpetual winter. Harvos was sent to investigate the cause of the shift in climate, but was captured by the Techno Union and mutated into a super soldier for their purposes. He was freed by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during his transformation and helped destroy the Techno Union's base.\nHarvos was a male Nelvaanian warrior from Rokrul village on the planet Nelvaan in the Outer Rim Territories. Sometime during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Techno Union, allied with the Confederacy, constructed a laboratory on Nelvaan that drained the planet of geothermal energy. Harvos, along with all the male warriors from Rokrul, was sent to investigate what was causing the planet's new indefinite winter, as the shaman Orvos saw the change as a sickness befalling their Great Mother deity.\nHarvos was captured by battle droids and brought to the Techno Union laboratory where Skakoan scientists altered his body genetically and implanted strange forms of technology. He was placed in a liquid-filled tank, and his body grew in size until his appearance differed significantly from that of his former self. During his transformation, the base was infiltrated by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi freed Harvos and his fellow warriors, though the men initially turned to attack Skywalker. Harvos reminded his comrades that anybody who would help free them could not be their enemy, and the warriors turned their rage toward their Skakoan captors, in turn helping Skywalker destroy the base.\nHarvos and the other males returned to Rokrul village with Skywalker, and although initially met with hesitation and shock from their female counterparts due to their mutated appearance, a child approached the men without fear, and the females had a quick change of heart, moving in to embrace their long lost loved ones. The village then celebrated their return with dancing and a bonfire.\nHarvos was able to remain calm and coherent, even after being mostly mutated, and was able to convince his fellow warriors to turn their anger away from their liberator and toward their captors. He felt they were first Nelvaanians, and that anyone who helped them was not their enemy. Like his fellow Nelvaanians, he had gray-blue skin with black hair and eyes, and he sported black tattoos on his upper torso. Prior to his mutation, he had a small body, but his alterations caused his body to grow immensely, the top of his head to bald, his front teeth to protrude from his mouth, and his tattoos to disappear.\nHarvos made his first appearance in Chapter 24 of the animated Star Wars: Clone Wars microseries, which aired on March 24, 2005 on Cartoon Network. The character was voiced by Richard McGonagle. He was first named in the \"Nelvaanian\" Databank entry on StarWars.com.",
