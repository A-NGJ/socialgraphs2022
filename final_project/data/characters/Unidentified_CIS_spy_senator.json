 "content": "A male Human senator gave the Separatists information on the Republic's plans as they were holding his family captive. The Jedi High Council decided to send Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi and a group of clone troopers to find him on Coruscant. Mundi and his clones ambushed the Senator while he was giving Confederate agents Messo and Asajj Ventress a recording of the Republic's war plans. He was betrayed by Messo, and Ventress slashed him across the chest with her lightsaber. After killing all of the clones, Ventress blew up Mundi's gunship, and escaped. The senator died of his mortal chest wound. Just before he died, however, he told master Mundi that his aid would rendezvous with the Separatists on Mon Gazza.",
