 "content": "Forg F'Lopo was a male Kubaz, who lived on the planet Cularin during the time of the Clone Wars.\nF'Lopo was a petty criminal and was a patron of the Chasm, a cantina that was located in the city of Gadrin, on Cularin. Once while in the cantina's refresher, he found a holorecorder that, unknown to him, had been planted there by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. When Muun attacked the cantina a short time afterward, while in disguise as the Zabrak Jedi Nek Lawsirk, F'Lopo used the recorder to film the event. Afterward, he waited until he believed Muun was far away and then went home. He planned to sell the footage he had recorded to Cularin Now, but it was confiscated from him by the Office of Peace and Security.\nThe next day, he went back to The Chasm, as Bolt, the bartender, had invited him to have a few free drinks. While there, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who were investigating the attack, asked him a few questions about what had happened.",
