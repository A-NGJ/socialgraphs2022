 "content": "Lluda was a human female slicer and a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, a gang of spicerunners who operated on the planet Kijimi. Her parents were killed by the Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood when she was young, and she was taken in by Zorii Bliss, the leader of the Spice Runners. In 35 ABY, the Spice Runners were forced to escape the planet after the First Order learned of their presence, and Bliss intended to take Lluda with her in her Y-wing starfighter. However, Bliss was unable to reach her fighter due to First Order stormtroopers guarding the area, and Lluda gave her a chance to escape by distracting the troopers. Shortly afterward, Kijimi was destroyed by the Star Destroyer Derriphan of the Final Order.",
