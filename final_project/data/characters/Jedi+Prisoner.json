 "content": "This male Human Jedi prisoner was a Jedi who aided the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe Jedi was one of the few of his kind to survive Order 66. However, after the Battle of Yavin, he was captured and imprisoned by the Galactic Empire.\nIn 1 ABY, during the Empire Day festivities, he was held at Outpost GRF-7493 on Yavin 4 by an Imperial commander, Lord Vader and a number of other Imperials. He was kept alive, so that he could be interrogated for important information concerning the Rebellion.\nThe Imperial commander had an Imperial spacer interrogate the Jedi. The Imperial knew that the Jedi would not give in to direct threats, so he took another approach; he convinced the Jedi that he was in fact sent by Leia to rescue him, and to tell him to abort the mission. The Imperial gained the Jedi's trust, so he divulged the information that the Empire was looking for.\nThe Jedi prisoner was a stubborn individual, completely loyal to the Rebellion. However, he was too trusting, which proved to be his downfall during his interrogation.\nA Jedi prisoner, who lacked an official name, appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Jedi prisoner was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. During the 2005 Empire Day live event from June 29 to July 11, 2005, he could be found at an outpost on Yavin 4 and was part of a quest titled \"Happy Empire Day!.\" Imperial players had to interrogate the Jedi for information. Only by tricking him into believing that the Imperial was in fact a Rebel operative, would the Jedi be willing to divulge information. If the Imperial chose to be forceful or rude to the Jedi, the latter would cease talking, and the player could not complete the quest. After the live event ended, the Jedi prisoner never reappeared in the game since the Empire Day event was discontinued until its complete overhaul in 2008.",
