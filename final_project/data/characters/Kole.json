 "content": "Kole was a male Chadra-Fan who was part of Nym's Lok Revenants, and served as the Feeorin's co-pilot and first mate onboard his ship, Havoc.\nKole was known to be a master of disguise, and had, according to Nym, at one time successfully impersonated a Republic senator. During a trade onboard her space station, mercenary Vana Sage double-crossed Nym and his crew, and a fight broke out. Nym, Kole and Jinkins were captured, with the latter two sent in an escape pod to the surface of Maramere, while Nym was incarcerated onboard Stockade. However, thanks to Kole's infiltration expertise, he and Jinkins were able to disguise themselves as professional torturers and gain access to Nym's cell, whereupon the Feeorin pirate escaped from custody.\nKole remained with Nym in the years to come, aiding him during his battle with Sol Sixxa and the Mere, and later rescued members of his crew from Spacestation 1138, piloting the transport Liberator in the midst of a fierce battle.\nAfter the defeat of the Trade Federation, Kole and Jinkins remained loyal to Nym and stayed with him almost continually over the years, with Kole serving as Nym's first mate. Following the Clone Wars, Nym assumed the leadership of the planet Lok and ruled the planet for decades. At the height of the Galactic Civil War, Lok had fallen under the control of the Galactic Empire but Nym remained the effective ruler of the planet.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Nym and Kole were very interested in a secret Imperial research facility on Lok that produced experimental weapons. In 1 ABY, the Lok Revenants learnt from the corrupted Imperial Sergeant Moore that the Empire had completed the development of a new weapon known as Imperial Military Grade Grenade Casing Unit . The Chadra-Fan therefore decided to steal some IMGGCU prototypes.\nKole thus tasked a group of spacers who previously worked with Vana Sage and Jinkins with stealing novel weapons in the Imperial research facility. Although the facility was not guarded by Imperial troops, the spacers had to fight numerous mercenaries and droidekas that defended the place. The Revenants finally found crates of IMGGCU prototypes and research data and brought them back to Kole in Nym's fortress.\nIn the meantime, the tensions between the Lok Revenants and the Sulfur Lake Pirates, another criminal group active on Lok, turned to open war. After some setbacks, the pirates set up an elaborate plan to directly attack Nym in his palace. They hijacked a shuttle carrying an envoy of Tatooinan politicians to a meeting with Nym. As the shuttle landed in the courtyard of the palace, Nym and the other leaders of the Lok Revenants—Vana Sage, Kole and Jinkins—arrived to greet the Tatooinan envoy. A battle subsequently erupted in the palace when the Sulfur Lake Pirates emerged unexpectedly from the shuttle and attacked the Revenants. However, the superior fighting skills of Nym's henchmen allowed them to eliminate every Sulfur Lake Pirate. Nym, Kole, and the other leaders of the Lok Revenants survived the attack.\nKole was a capable pilot and engineer, but his chief skill was his ability to disguise himself.\nKole first appeared in Star Wars Tales, then went on to play a supporting role in Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter. A slightly aged Kole was given a model in Star Wars Galaxies, along with his partner Nym. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia mistakenly refers to Bavo, the identity Kole assumes in \"Single Cell,\" as an actual character and not an alias.\nKole was a Non-Player Character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Kole was added to the game as part of the so-called \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Publish 3\" on October 8, 2003. His dialogues and quests were modified after Nym's Theme Park was revamped with the release of the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
