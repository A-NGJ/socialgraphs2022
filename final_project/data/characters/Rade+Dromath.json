 "content": "Rade Dromath was a tall blond, blue-eyed Human male native to Garqi.\nHis mother was Dynba Tesc and his father was a New Republic Defense Force officer killed in the Thrawn campaign. His mother always planned for an invasion of Garqi by the Imperial Remnant, and so formulated escape and resistance plans and made secret stockpiles of supplies.\nAlthough his mother was killed when the Yuuzhan Vong first invaded Garqi, Rade escaped and used her preparations to become a leading member of the Garqi Resistance, later helping a New Republic commando unit during the Battle of Garqi. Along with the rest of the Resistance, he chose to remain behind to fight the Vong on their homeworld than to accompany the New Republic team offworld.",
