 "content": "Newin Seedel was a Human Meatlump who lived on the planet Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, Seedel operated out of the Meatlump Hideout beneath Coronet City. Seedel was an avid knitter, often times sewing together various items, while sometimes performing surgeries for gang members. Seedel used to sew together pieces of dolls resembling members of the Meatlump Gang, including the Meatlump King himself.\nNewin Seedel was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Newin Seedel was added to the game as part of the \"Meatlumps Theme Park\", introduced with \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008. During each server reset, Seedel's gender and appearance was randomized, but Seedel consistently appeared as a Human.\nBy switching the first letters in Seedel's first and last name, the name appears like Sewin Needel, similar in spelling to sewing needle. This would appear to be a reference to the fact that Newin Seedel's primary function was to sew things together.",
