 "content": "Chenik Kruun was a Muun male who resided on the planet Muunilinst. He was the employer of the Nuknog podracer Gilag Pitaaani. In 0 ABY, Kruun entered Pitaaani on a podrace believing he would finally beat his longtime rival Nal Kenuun, whose podracer Grunta died a few days before the race. The race was won by Luke Skywalker, who took Grunta's place as part of a deal he negotiated with Kenuun.\nKruun was described by Haari Ikreme Beeerd—one of the crewmen on his employ—as cold-blooded and emotionless.",
