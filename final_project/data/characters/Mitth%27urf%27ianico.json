 "content": "Mitth'urf'ianico, also known by his core name of Thurfian, was a Chiss male of the Mitth family who served, at various points in his life, as an Aristocra, Syndic, Syndic Prime, and Patriarch for that family. Despite sharing a family with Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn,\" Thurfian grew to be one of Thrawn's greatest enemies within the Chiss Ascendancy, as he was vehemently opposed to Thrawn's obliviousness to politics. He and Irizi'stal'mustro plotted to bring the Senior Captain.\nYears before the Nikardun conquests, Thurfian, then an Aristocra, was tasked with recruiting cadet Kivu'raw'nuru of Rentor to join the Mitth family as a merit adoptive. Kivu'raw'nuru, then known by the core name Vurawn, was from an obscure family of low prestige. In spite of Vurawn's humble origins, he had grades, aptitude, and logic matrix that were \"off the boards,\" making him a prime candidate to become a cadet at the Taharim Academy on Naporar. Unbeknownst to Thurfian, Mitth family Patriarch Thooraki had insisted on recruiting Vurawn to the Mitth. Vurawn would later become Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, better known as Thrawn.\nAt the time of the Vagaari pirate operations, Thurfian was working as an overseer of a transportation and commerce office. At that time, Thrawn conducted a militarily successful but political mixed result with the acquisition of a gravity well projector from Lesser Space but the loss of the life of Syndic Mitth'ras'safis and a starship containing untold valuable Lesser Space technology.\nBy 19 BBY, Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo had a reputation in the Ascendancy for brilliant military successes but also occasional disastrous political results from his campaigns. Such events included the Lioaoin pirate campaign and the Vagaari pirate operations, which were military successes with heavy political fallout. Despite Thrawn's service in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, and despite the Fleet's mission to evaluate threats to the Ascendancy beyond their borders, Syndic Thurfian ardently opposed any action on Thrawn's part for fear of political fallout on the Ascendancy and on Mitth. Thurfian regularly viewed Thrawn as violating the Ascendancy's non-aggression protocols, even when others viewed Thrawn's actions as permitted.\nDespite the honor Thrawn would come to bring the Mitth family, Thurfian became an ardent enemy of Thrawn's. Thurfian considered Thrawn as likely to bring great ruin on the Mitth family as honor and glory. In 18 BBY, he conspired with Syndic Zistalmu of the rival Irizi family in order to manipulate Thrawn's career and embarrass him, but the pair failed to stop Thrawn's rise.\nBetween the Battle over Primea and the conclusion of the Nikardun campaigns, Mitth'urf'ianico was secretly promoted to the rank of Syndic Prime. As Syndic Prime, Thurfian helped resolve a dispute between the Xodlak and Evroes families, and continued trying to sabotage Thrawn's career.\nUpon the death of Patriarch Thooraki, Syndic Prime Thurfian was promoted to Patriarch of the Mitth family. As new Patriarch, he was told the long suppressed history of the Mitth by Senior Aide Thivik, as well as the story about Starflash.\nMitth'urf'ianico had a strong disdain for Senior Captain Thrawn, which grew over time into a conspiratorial vendetta to derail Thrawn's career. His distaste for Thrawn was motivated by fear that Thrawn would lead the Mitth family, and possibly the whole Chiss Ascendancy, into ruin.\nIn spite of his animosity towards Thrawn, Thurfian was shown to have a strong sense of justice, or at least to present one, regarding everyday citizens of the Chiss Ascendancy.",
