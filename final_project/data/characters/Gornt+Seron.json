 "content": "Gornt Seron was a male Hethas gangster and crime lord who operated during the New Republic era. His base of operation was the planet Korbin. Seron's known employees included two members of a stalk-eyed species that were on relatively familiar terms with him. He also employed Kin Laron, an assassin. Laron was dispatched to hunt down the criminal Den Hardon, who was wanted by Seron.\nGornt Seron was born on the planet Korbin in 48 BBY, the son of criminals stranded on the world. Over several decades of criminal activity, Seron amassed a fortune and became one of the more prominent crime lords on Korbin. Seron's illegal activities stretched from Korbin to several other worlds, and his primary interest was illegal gambling, although he was known to dabble in extortion, smuggling, and arms running. Seron's handling of his businesses was so adept that little evidence of his illegal activities could be found. The New Republic resorted to charging Seron with underreporting the income of his legitimate business holdings. The New Republic believed that the companies were fronts of handling contraband goods and laundering dirty credits.\nSeron benefited from the death of Jabba the Hutt by absorbing elements of his organization. The crime lord once acquired detailed information on the New Republic's plans to deal with the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Seron's agents contacted the New Republic, demanding 200,000 credits which was reluctantly paid although no evidence was found that Seron was directly involved. As a result, all New Republic agents had standing orders to arrest Seron on sight, and the New Republic posted a reward of 75,000 credits for Seron's capture on charges of intent to defraud the New Republic government of tax revenues. In 10 ABY, Seron killed Sub-Prefect Neris for refusing to be corrupted. Seron had also killed Neris' predecessor, Bregless.\nSeron was a male Hethas who stood two meters tall.\nSeron was skilled with a blaster, and knowledgeable about alien species, cultures, languages, and planetary systems. He also had a working understanding of bureaucratic procedure, and was knowledgeable about the value of spice.\nSeron carried a datapad and comlink.\nSeron was profiled in Wanted by Cracken, a sourcebook published by West End Games in 1993. The illustration of Seron was provided by Mike Vilardi.",
