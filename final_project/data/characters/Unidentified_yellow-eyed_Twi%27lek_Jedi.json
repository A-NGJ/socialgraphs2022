Active in the year 340 BBY, they successfully averted an assassination attempt on a public official. Reporting back to the Coruscant Jedi Temple, this individual filed an official report with the current Grand Master of the age.\nLong after this Jedi's time, a recording of his meeting with the Grand Master was discovered to have survived the Great Jedi Purge of 19 BBY. Rescued from the Temple by the Last Curator of Records, the files were viewed by Luke Skywalker while rummaging through the Curator's belongings.",
