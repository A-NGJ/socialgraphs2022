 "content": "Memily was a Human female who served as a loyal servant to Bail Organa and worked at the Royal Palace on the planet of Alderaan where she did most of the cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the young Princess Leia Organa. She made a type of pastry nicknamed Memily's basket.\nOne day when babysitting Leia in a popular park in Aldera, the capital city of Alderaan, she was about to lean on a railing that over looked a cliff when Leia threw her laserball at it and Memily realized that the railing was about to fall. This was the first thing that confirmed that Leia was Force-sensitive besides that Anakin Skywalker was her father.",
