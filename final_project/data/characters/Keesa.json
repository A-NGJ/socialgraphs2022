 "content": "Keesa was the Pa'lowick assistant of Dama Whitesun Brunk at the Sidi Driss Inn in Anchorhead. In 8 ABY, when Imperial troops raided the town in search of the famous moss-painting, Killik Twilight, Keesa was assaulted. For their actions against the woman, the troops were reprimanded by their commander—an undercover Grand Admiral Thrawn—and Keesa received an apology from the Grand Admiral for his treatment of her.",
