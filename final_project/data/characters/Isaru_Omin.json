 "content": "Isaru Omin was a Force-sensitive Human male who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was rejected by the Jedi Order due to his age and later served as a Senate Guard.\nAt the age of two, Omin was discovered by the Jedi to be Force-sensitive, but was not taken in for training as he was considered to be too old by that point.\nDuring the last few years of the Galactic Republic, Omin served as a Senate Guard. He was the partner of Sagoro Autem, and served under Commander Zalin Bey. In 23 BBY, Omin and Autem investigated the murder of Senator Jheramahd Greyshade. It was discovered that Autem's brother was responsible, with unknowing help from his son, Reymet Autem. Sagoro planned on letting his son escape, and Omin was forced to arrest his partner.\nLater, during the Clone Wars, Omin was a member of the Guard unit responsible for protecting Bail Organa. After the formation of the Galactic Empire, Omin helped his former partner, now wanted by Darth Vader, to escape from Coruscant. Refusing to give the Sith Lord information, Isaru was brutally killed by Vader.",
