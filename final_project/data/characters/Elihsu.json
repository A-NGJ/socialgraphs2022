 "content": "Elihsu was a male Sullustan who worked on a Republic archaeological salvage team during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. The team were cataloging the casualties of the Destruction of Taris when he and most of the team were killed by rakghouls, leaving only Cera and Garthe alive. Cera asked a Republic-allied individual to investigate the team's fates, and the individual recovered Elihsu's datapad with a final message to Garthe.\nA male Sullustan, Elihsu worked with an archaelogical team during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. He and his team worked on Taris, where they were cataloging those who died in the bombardment by Darth Malak. While they worked, Elihsu and his fellow Sullustan Garthe were secretly stealing from the corpses they found. He and the rest of his team, minus Garthe and the human Cera, went out early one day in 3643 BBY from their base at Waypoint Station Aurek on an expedition into a dangerous area of the ruins. They were killed by a group of rakghouls while in the broken chemical pipes of the Sinking City.\nCera asked a Republic-allied individual to investigate and find out if the group was dead, despite Garthe's cynical doubt that they survived. The individual discovered the team's remains in the pipes, finding Elihsu's datapad among their skeletons. On the datapad, Elihsu left a message for Garthe, telling him that he should stop stealing from the bodies, since Elihsu now knew how the dead felt. The individual returned to Cera and Garthe with news of the team's fate, and revealed Garthe's crimes to Cera.\nElihsu was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. His body appears in the Republic Taris mission \"The Corpse Counters\", where Cera asks the player to find out what happened to the team. They find Elihsu's datapad, and can choose to reveal Garthe as a thief for light side points or force Garthe to bribe them for dark side points.",
