He was aboard the  Liberator when the ship was forced to make an emergency landing on the planet Galzez, and was called upon to accompany Ezra Bridger when the latter wanted to scout out the immediate surroundings.\nHigz was shot shortly thereafter, by a group of Dug gangsters, just as Bridger warned Higz and his comrade to take cover.",
