 "content": "Harvin Franchels was a Human male and a Major in the Royal Security Force during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, he was the RSF officer in charge of the situation during the terrorist attack in Theed. Even after the initial attack, many terrorists remain in the part of the city that suffered the attack. Major Franchels tasked his agents to eliminate the remaining terrorists, disarm the bombs placed in the streets and deliver medical supplies to use on victims of the terrorist attack. After the situation was fixed, he transferred his agents to RSF Intelligence Sergeant Bragg to investigate the identity of the culprits.\nHarvin Franchels appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Harvin Franchels was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
