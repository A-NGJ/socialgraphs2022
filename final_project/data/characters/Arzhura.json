 "content": "Arzhura was a Human female criminal who was imprisoned by the Galactic Republic in Belsavis prison, a prison facility on the planet Belsavis. During the invasion of Belsavis in the Galactic War, Arzhura was freed from imprisonment, and started selling armor to the forces of the Sith Empire in the Imperial Lodgement in the Minimum Security Section.\nArzhura appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as an Armor Vendor for Imperial players on Belsavis. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, she was removed from the game along with the rest of the Armor Vendors.",
