 "content": "Kkrax was a Sullustan male who resided in the city of Restuss on the moon Rori. Sometime following 0 BBY, Boba Fett tasked a spacer with the job of hunting down an individual named Uff Wogo, who had a high bounty on his head. In the search for information, the spacer sough Kkrax at the Restuss refugee camp. Kkrax at first revealed no information to the spacer, apparently not wanting to get involved with the situation. In order to intimidate him, the spacer opened the small box that Boba Fett had given him. Inside was a piece of cloth, and a severed finger with a ring still on it.\nKkrax, sickened by what he had just seen, became more cooperative. He informed the spacer that he would need to go the Dantooine system to intercept Ogveer, a Rodian smuggler who helped Uff escape.\nKkrax appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
