 "content": "Wolver was a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy who served on the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vengeance during the Galactic Civil War. Nine months after the Battle of Yavin, Wolver and Lieutenant Tier accompanied Captain Thrawn on a trip to S'krrr to study S'krrr art. While Thrawn was studying the Sikadian Gardens, Wolver left the shuttle Tessera to deliver a message to his commander. However, as he made his way to Thrawn, he was attacked by a swarm of drog beetles and eaten alive. When Thrawn later discovered the body, along with Zak and Tash Arranda, he launched a murder investigation to uncover the cause of Wolver's death.",
