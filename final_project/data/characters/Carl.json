 "content": "Carl was a Shikitari, who was entered as a competitor in The Cauldron by a Devaronian conman, alongside several unsavory characters. He was defeated by Bugnaught.\nLike all members of his species at this stage in their life cycle, Carl was made up of several pupae, perfectly suited for gladiatorial combat. This stage of his life cycle was very short, lasting only two standard days. The Devaronian had pocketed a considerable price for Carl, snickering to himself that in two days, his buyer would be the proud owner of a hardened chrysalis from which twelve harmless flutterscouts would emerge.\nAfter attacking a Bugnaught droid, Carl lifted the apparently defenseless machine over his head. It then proceeded to unleash its flamethrower arm, killing Carl.",
