 "content": "Llats Ward was a Human male Mandalorian mercenary, selected by Jango Fett to train Jango's clones on Kamino as part of the Cuy'val Dar.\nEverything in the life of Llats revolved around battle and war. He had studied and memorized the campaigns of all the great Mandalorian leaders of the past, and used them as lessons to enhance the clone troopers' fighting skills.\nHe wore gray-and-green armor, with yellow knee and shoulder pads and a large Mythosaur skull painted across the chest.\nLlats Ward was created for an exclusive Entertainment Earth 14 action figure pack. The figure has a new mold head, waist, torso and cape. The arms, legs, and helmet are from Boba Fett molds.",
