 "content": "Sammie was a human male mechanic who served aboard the MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser Halcyon during the First Order-Resistance War. He was young and enthusiastic, though he felt vulnerable traveling so far away from his homeworld and attempted to mask his insecurities behind an exaggerated nature.\nThe ship mechanic appeared in Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, an immersive hotel experience which opened in 2022 at the Walt Disney World Resort. In audition sides posted for the character by The Walt Disney Company, the mechanic informs guests that the cruiser's captain secretly instructed him to lock-out the hyperdrive of the Halcyon without the approval of the ship's newly appointed First Order lieutenant.",
