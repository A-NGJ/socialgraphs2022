 "content": "Gusyin Tatam was an Aki-Aki child that attended the Festival of the Ancestors in 35 ABY.\nAs a child, Gusyin Tatam attended the Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley on the Aki-Aki homeworld Pasaana in 35 ABY. With a mischievous grin, Tatam sat on a rug under a marquee with a number of other Aki-Aki children to watch a puppet show being performed by an adult Aki-Aki as part of the festival. The child had brown eyes and pale skin, and wore yellow pants and a green shirt with a matching bead necklace.\nGusyin Tatam first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. The character was performed by puppeteer Steven Kynman, who referred to the character using feminine pronouns.",
