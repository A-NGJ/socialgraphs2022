 "content": "Synoda was a female Togruta doctor who worked on Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA female Togruta, Doctor Synoda joined the Republic's resettlement project on Taris to investigate Colu's syndrome, a rare disease that afflicted only the descendants of the survivors of Taris' destruction. Her own ancestors had fled Taris three centuries ago, meaning that Dr. Synoda was likely afflicted by Colu's syndrome as well.\nSynoda based her research in a small camp in the Republic Reconstruction Grounds, near Waypoint Station Aurek. As that area was rife with rakghouls, pirates, and wild ferrazid hounds, Synoda employed a unit of Republic sentry droids.\nDuring the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire, she asked a traveling hero to help her with her research. Synoda asked them to recover the records of the Tarisians who lived before the bombardment from the ruins of Dynamet General Hospital, which was overrun with rakghouls and infected sentients. The hero was able to recover the records, which she believed would greatly aid her research and help alleviate the suffering of the Tarisian descendants.\nSynoda was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\nreleased by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears on Taris, where she can give Republic characters the mission \"Legacy of Death\".",
