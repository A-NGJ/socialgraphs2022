 "content": "Avarik was a Human male who served the Galactic Empire as a scout trooper corporal in Tempest Force during the Galactic Civil War.\nRenowned among his fellow Imperials as a frequent participant in off-duty bar brawls, Avarik was partners with Sergeant Elsek following graduation from the Corulag Academy. His partner was often forced to cover for Avarik's rash decisions, such as Avarik's frequent engagement in brawls at Corulag's local bars and enlisted clubs. Elsek often had to bail his partner out of those fights. As a corporal, Avarik was assigned as part of a biker scout unit to monitor the activities of the Yuzzum on the forest moon of Endor. He later had an unpleasant encounter with Han Solo, who bested him in fisticuffs, while Elsek, who he ordered to send backup, was knocked unconscious by the Wookiee Chewbacca.",
