 "content": "Gulin was a human lieutenant in the Imperial Navy. In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Endor, during which the Galactic Empire suffered a massive defeat at the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Gulin was stationed on the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Torment under the direct command of Lerr Duvat.\nGulin informed Duvat that a messenger had arrived on the Torment, and was ushered off the ship's bridge along with several other officers. The messenger, playing a message from the late Emperor Sheev Palpatine, informed Duvat that he would play a role in Palpatine's posthumous contingency plan, Operation: Cinder, and gave Duvat his target: the planet Naboo. In orbit over Naboo, the Torment deployed a climate disruption array and jammed sensors on the planet. Gulin informed Duvat that the array was at twenty percent and the jamming was at full power, noting that several hurricanes had begun forming on Naboo.",
