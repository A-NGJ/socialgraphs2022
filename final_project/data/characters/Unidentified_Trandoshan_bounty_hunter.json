 "content": "A Trandoshan male operated as a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild during the era of the New Republic. In 9 ABY, the bounty hunter was recruited by Greef Karga to steal a force-sensitive child from the Mandalorian. He was ambushed by a native reptavian, who plucked him from the ground.\nIn 9 ABY, the bounty hunter was a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. He was recruited by the Guild agent Greef Karga on Nevarro to join his \"security detail,\" alongside a human and a Nikto. Karga planned to confront the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, who was in possession of a Force-sensitive child that an Imperial remnant had tapped the Guild to capture.\nThe Trandoshan and his two colleagues joined Karga in meeting Djarin in the lava fields on Nevarro. Djarin arrived on his starship, the Razor Crest, and approached the four with his own team, the ex-rebel Cara Dune and the Ugnaught Kuiil, riding blurrgs. Karga began by acknowledging both their security details and inspected the Child.\nThe two parties then traveled across the lava fields towards the city and set up camp for the night. That night, the group sat by the fire and Djarin and Karga discussed plans to kill the supposed leader of the Imperial forces in the city. As Karga said this, the camp was attacked by native reptavians. The bounty hunters fended them off as they tried to seize the blurrgs, taking one away in the process.\nAs a moment of silence ensued, the Trandoshan looked around, only to be taken by surprise by one of the creatures, who carried him away as Karga and the rest of the group shot at it.\nThe Trandoshan bounty hunter wore a tattered brown and white outfit with writing at the end of his right sleeve. He wore a gray bowl-shaped helmet, a necklace decorated with teeth, and a device on the right side of his abdomen. The Trandoshan wielded a vibro-ax and a blaster.\nThe Trandoshan bounty hunter first appeared in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning,\" the seventh episode of Jon Favreau's live-action Disney+ series the The Mandalorian which was directed by Deborah Chow and released on December 18, 2019. The character was played by an unspecified extra. In making concept art of the bounty hunter, Brian Matyas was advised about using a Trandoshan, and chose to explore putting a helmet on the alien to only show its mouth.",
