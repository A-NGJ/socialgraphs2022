He was one of the initial suspects in Volette's murder, but was exonerated. He became shocked when it was revealed by Jedi Knight Jax Pavan that Volette had been murdered by the Umber family's protocol droid, who only wished to heal the suffering of Umber's wife, Kirma.\nUmber was a Vindalian noble, and generally kept to himself.",
