 "content": "Cheroth was a female Mirialan who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A red-headed female with red eyes, she had olive-colored skin and facial tattoos, as was common to members of her species. She wore her hair in a bun, and dressed primarily in green and tan desert clothing. During the Cold War, Cheroth worked in the Anchorhead cantina Junix's Joint as a waitress.\nCheroth was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare in 2011. She appears in Anchorhead, the Republic-only city on Tatooine, as a Cantina Vendor.",
