 "content": "Siena Pavan was a Force-sensitive Human female who was the short-time wife of Lorn Pavan and mother to Jax Pavan.\nAlthough it is never explicitly stated in Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter, the novel implies that a woman named Siena was Lorn Pavan's last serious relationship. The novel also mentions that he has a son, one over which he appears to have full custody, as he is the one who gives his son over to the Jedi Order. Finally, the novel also implies that it was Lorn's discharge from service at the Jedi Temple that sent his life into a tailspin. It was presumed from Shadow Hunter that \"Siena\" was Lorn's wife; this was confirmed in Coruscant Nights I: Jedi Twilight.",
