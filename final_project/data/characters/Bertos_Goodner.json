 "content": "Bertos Goodner was a male Twi'lek who lived on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War. Posing as a dancer, he was in fact a spy of the Rebel Alliance.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Bertos Goodner stood by the entrance of the Moenia spaceport on Naboo. Posing as a dancer, Bertos Goodner would offer to dance for traveling spacers who passed through the city. The Twi'lek preferred to dance at the spaceport rather than in the cantina so he could gather more information from the travelers. In fact, Bertos Goodner was a member of the Alliance Intelligence and the commander of the Rebel spies on Naboo.\nIn 1 ABY, a Rebel spy named Simo Oron was captured by Imperial forces and detained in a small Imperial Base in the Lasay Swamp. On Corellia, the Rebellion made arrangements to rescue Simo but his personal effects, including a sensitive contact list, were left behind. The Rebel droid C-3PO therefore tasked a group of Rebel operatives with obtaining his contact list in the Imperial base on Naboo. After the Rebel operatives succeeded in finding the contact list, they handed it over to Bertos Goodner in Moenia.\nBertos Goodner was a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBertos Goodner was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed, released on October 27, 2004. This NPC was originally a \"greeter NPC\": an NPC present at the entrance of a starport to provide general information to players arriving on a new planet. Bertos Goodner was later integrated into a quest of the revamped \"Rebel Theme Park\", released with the \"Chapter 6\" update, on May 22, 2007.",
