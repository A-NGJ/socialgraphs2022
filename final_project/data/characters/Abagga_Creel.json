 "content": "Abagga Creel was a female Corellian businesswoman who resided on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Abagga Creel was the assistant of the businessman Ral Mundi, head of Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium, in Coronet City. In 1 ABY, an important shipment ordered by Ral Mundi disappeared during its transports, putting the company on the verge of ruin. Creel thus worked with a spacer to find information concerning the missing shipment. The spacer would eventually recover the shipment that was stolen by the Ragtags.\nAround the same time, Abagga Creel donated her luxury SoroSuub Personal Luxury Yacht 3000 named Spirit of Corellia to the service of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nAbagga Creel was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nAbagga Creel was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 21\", on August 4, 2005. She was part of the quest named \"Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components\", best known as \"Ral Mundi's quest\". Ral Mundi's quest was revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the quest was inserted into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.\nIn the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game expansion Squadrons Over Corellia, it is explained that Abagga Creel donated the Spirit of Corellia.",
