 "content": "Myoris Lin was a female Human teacher who lived on the planet Harix during the Galactic Civil War. The mother of a young boy named Berd, Lin taught at a school with ties to the Rebel Alliance, which drew the attention of the Galactic Empire in 1 ABY. Under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Imperial Major Stafuv Rahz and a complement of stormtroopers kidnapped Lin and most of her class, hoping to use them to draw out key Rebel leaders. Only Lin's son Berd escaped, and he managed to recruit Rebels Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to lead a rescue mission. Although Rahz planned to execute Lin and the captives personally within their school, Skywalker and Solo arrived just in time to rescue them. Afterward, Lin, her son, and her students fled Harix with the Rebels.\nMyoris Lin first appeared in Bring Me the Children, a comic strip story arc written by Don Christensen and released in 1980. In his comic appearance, Lin was illustrated by Russ Manning. Although originally identified only as Myoris in Bring Me the Children, her last name of Lin was given 27 years later, in Abel G. Pe√±a and Rich Handley's Hyperspace supplement Aliens in the Empire.",
