 "content": "Damalia Korde was a Human female who lived during the Galactic Civil War. She was interested in nature and biology. Korde had traveled to the city of Dee'ja Peak on Naboo to study the local wildlife and never left again because she liked the place very much. She was then given a job as a groundskeeper.\nIn 1 ABY the courier Bor Ting was sent to deliver a datadisc to her that contained information about the Berserker Virus. When Ting took a leg injury on his way through the Nabooian countryside, Korde hired a spacer to find him and bring the datadisc to her.",
