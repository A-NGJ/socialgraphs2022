 "content": "Finn was a male Human who served as an Imperial TIE/LN starfighter pilot who was attached to Crimson Squadron when it was stationed on Cilpar in 4 ABY.\nHe was killed shortly before the arrival of Tycho Celchu, who was operating in an undercover role, in the squadron, shot by a blaster bolt to the thorax. All that was ever found of him were his head and feet. His life-support helmet was given to Tycho, as he did not have one of his own to use.",
