 "content": "Tuber was the nickname Anakin Solo gave to an elder Dantari tribesman that he encountered on Dantooine in 25 ABY, during the early part of the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nTuber would occasionally bring \nblba firewood to Anakin and Mara Jade Skywalker at their camp, looking to trade it for vincha roots or small trinkets, which Tuber then braided into his hair. He was distinguished from the rest of his tribe of Dantari by the crude Imperial emblem that had been tattooed onto his chest.\nTuber, along with his tribe of Dantari, were briefly captured and tortured by the Yuuzhan Vong. Anakin, however, was able to rescue the natives from Vong captivity. Due to communication barriers, Anakin used the Force to project his thoughts into the mind of Tuber, telling him to take his tribe to safety within the deep mountain valleys of Dantooine, thinking that the valley, with its long grasses and vincha roots by the dozens would perhaps be sanctuary for the Dantari during the impending invasion of Dantooine by the extragalactic aliens.",
