 "content": "Niall Grast was a male Human from the planet Zakuul who served in the Knights of Zakuul during the era in which the Eternal Empire ruled over the galaxy. An elite Knight who held the title of Paladin, Grast wore dark armor and wielded two blue lightsabers in battle. He was stationed aboard the Star Fortress over the planet Tatooine, and died around 3631 BBY when the Star Fortress was invaded and destroyed.\nNiall Grast was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Knights of the Fallen Empire, a 2015 Digital Expansion. He is one of four possible Paladins that can spawn during the Tatooine version of the \"The Star Fortress\" Flashpoint; as the Star Fortress is destroyed with all hands aboard, this article assumes that Grast died either in battle or when the battle station exploded.",
