 "content": "Nok was a male Ithorian RNSF officer who lived on the lush Mid Rim world of Naboo during the Galactic Civil War. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Officer Nok was present at a small graveyard north of the city Keren. During this time, he reported to a spacer that he had seen the wanted Mauler leader by the name of Doogal Belstar put something by the gravestone. He suggested that a spacer working for Captain Typho investigate it further. The investigation resulted in the death of the criminal.\nNok was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Nok was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
