 "content": "Chelik was a princess of the Hapan Royal House, a niece of Ta'a Chume, and the older sister of Alyssia. She was believed to harbour ambitions to usurp the throne and become Queen Mother of Hapes.\nIn 27 ABY, Chelik's daughter attempted to assassinate her cousin Prince Isolder. As the reigning Queen Mother, Teneniel Djo, was rapidly losing influence, Isolder's daughter Tenel Ka initially assumed that this was a desperate coup attempt by Chelik, but later reflected that this was more likely the result of scheming by her ambitious sister Alyssia, who saw the families of both Ta'a Chume and Chelik as obstacles to her own ambitions.\nIn the event, Alyssia's schemes failed, and Tenel Ka succeeded to the throne.",
