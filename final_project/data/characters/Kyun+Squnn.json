 "content": "Kyun Squnn was the second administrator of the SoroSuub Corporation regional offices in Tindark on Cularin. She was a capable bureaucrat and was fiercely loyal to SoroSuub, though she could be a bit na√Øve, especially when told that an action would ultimately benefit SoroSuub. Her boss appreciated her work, but might have taken too much interest in her personally.\nSqunn enjoyed the openness of Cularin more than living in caves on Sullust. She was married to a pilot who flew between the SoroSuub offices on Cularin and Genarius and was often gone. She was pregnant with their first child in 31 BBY, and often worried for his safety.",
