 "content": "Krantz was a human member of the Morubas crime family. In 19 BBY, the Shadow Collective criminal alliance launched an attack on the Morubas stronghold after the family poisoned the Shadow Collective's leader, former Dark Lord of the Sith Maul, and took him hostage. During the battle, Krantz reported to Jjan, the leader of the crime family, that the number of Shadow Collective attackers was growing. Jjan interrupted the update on the barrage to express gratitude for the report, but he considered it unimportant since Maul was in chains. Having previously heard that Maul had once killed a Jedi led Jjan to expect more from leader of the Shadow Collective, and Jjan asked Krantz to agree with him that he had been excited by the rumors; Krantz did so. However, Maul was only feigning incapacitation to fool the Morubas family and broke free using the dark side. Krantz had a light skin tone with white hair and wore a yellow and blue suit.",
