 "content": "Mikkel Sutmani was an Ithorian male Jedi Knight in the Jedi Order during the High Republic Era. Sutmani piloted a Jedi Vector during the combined Jedi and Galactic Republic effort to rescue the Hetzal system from debris, alongside the Vectors of fellow Knights Te'Ami and Nib Assek and the Republic Longbeam cruiser piloted by Joss and Pikka Adren.\nFollowing the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Sutmani was part of a mission to retrieve the flight recorder of the Legacy Run, along with Te'Ami and several Republic Longbeams. While on the mission to retrieve the flight recorder, the Republic party was engaged by Nihil forces. During this skirmish, Sutmani was saved by Te'Ami when her craft collided with a missile on a course to collide with Sutmani's Jedi Vector. Sutmani also took part in the Battle of Kur where many Jedi lost their lives.\nAround one year later, Sutmani flew a Jedi Vector at the opening of the Valo Republic Fair. Later, during the Nihil attack on Valo, Sutmani helped his fellow Jedi to catch falling civilians from the collapsing world pavilions with his Jedi Vector. Sutmani perished when the Nihil warrior he caught attacked his Vector, causing it to crash into the city below.\nSutmani was particularly close with Te'Ami. They enjoyed working together and often teased each other during missions. Sutmani was able to sense his friend and was deeply affected by her death. Sutmani owned a blue-bladed crossguard lightsaber.",
