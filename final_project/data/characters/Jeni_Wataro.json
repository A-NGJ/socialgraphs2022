 "content": "Jeni Wataro was a female Chagrian who served as the chief aide to Senator Izzet Noor of Serenno during the High Republic Era, where she abused her position to spy for Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro. Serving as the Nihil's chief spy in the Galactic Republic, Wataro gave Ro information that helped him plan the Battle of Kur. Wataro continued to spy for Ro, alongside other spies he recruited in the Republic such as Senator Ghirra Starros, although she considered herself self-employed.\nAround 230 BBY, Wataro piloted a starship which was transporting the kidnapped Ghal Tarpfen, Head of Security of the Starlight Beacon, to the Nihil, as Starros thought the Mon Calamari might have some use. Tarpfen broke out of containment and discovered Wataro in the cockpit, overpowering her and taking over the ship. Lacking piloting skills and unable to read the ship's controls, Tarpfen sent a message back to the Republic warning of the Nihil infiltration as Nihil ships prepared to fire on the vessel as it had not identified itself. Wataro, regaining consciousness, attempted to break into the cockpit so she could activate the escape shuttles or transmit the password, but Tarpfen refused to do so, and everyone onboard the ship was left aboard with failing life support systems.",
