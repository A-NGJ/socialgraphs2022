 "content": "Vanat was a Human female from the planet Zakuul who was a member of the Scions of Zakuul, a subgroup of the Knights of Zakuul that specialized in Force visions and were obsessed with the idea of fate. A dark-skinned woman with black hair and brown eyes, Vanat wielded a magenta-colored lightsaber in battle like other Scions. After Emperor Arcann ordered the massacre of the Scions around the time of his ascension to the throne of the Eternal Empire, Vanat was among the few Scions who escaped the purge and settled in an enclave on the shadowport Asylum under the leadership of Heskal. In 3631 BBY, the Scions summoned the figure known as the Commander to Asylum and tested the foreigner to determine why they could not see the Outlander's future. Along with other Scions, Vanat attacked the Outlander with Berusal in one of a series of combat tests that ultimately revealed the presence of Valkorion, the Immortal Emperor, within the Outlander's mind. The Scions promised their loyalty to the Outlander, but Heskal later betrayed the Scions and the Outlander to Arcann and drew him to Asylum, as his visions led him to believe it was necessary to force a confrontation. Arcann killed Vanat and the other Scions just before the Outlander's arrival, sparking the Battle of Asylum.\nVanat appears in Chapter VI: Asylum in Knights of the Fallen Empire, a 2015 Digital Expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
