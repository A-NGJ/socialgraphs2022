 "content": "Harravan was a Hapan pirate who had kidnapped and murdered Kalen, Isolder's older brother. After spending nearly two years on the fringe, the prince tracked down and arrested him with the purpose of interrogating the pirate to find out who had hired him; however, Harravan was found dead in his jail cell before he could be questioned. Isolder later accused his mother, Queen Mother Ta'a Chume of hiring the pirate to kill her son and later having him killed.\nSome sources refer to this individual as Haravan.",
