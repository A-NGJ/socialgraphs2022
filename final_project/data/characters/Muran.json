 "content": "Muran was a male New Republic T-85 X-wing pilot who was a member of Commander Poe Dameron's Rapier Squadron during the later stages of the Cold War. He was killed during an engagement with First Order forces near Suraz 4.\nMuran was a New Republic T-85 X-wing pilot who flew under the callsign \"Rapier Four\". About twenty-nine years after the Battle of Endor, Poe Dameron, Rapier Leader, received a distress signal from the Yissira Zyde in the Mirrin sector. Muran and the rest of Rapier Squadron jumped to lightspeed and found forces of the First Order boarding the distressed freighter. Rapier Squadron engaged the hijackers, but the First Order successfully commandeered the ship and entered hyperspace. Muran was caught in the ship's wake, and his X-wing starfighter was destroyed before he could eject. Dameron felt Muran's death was avoidable, and blamed the First Order for it.\nMuran was a competent starfighter pilot. Poe Dameron complimented him for not complaining about their routine flights, unlike his fellow pilots Iolo Arana and Kar√© Kun. Despite his piloting skills, Muran was unable to avoid his death when a hyperspace wave generated by the hijacked freighter Yissira Zyde crashed into his X-wing.\nMuran first appeared in Before the Awakening, a junior novel written by Greg Rucka and published in 2015.",
