 "content": "Wall Bennis was a male Human Jedi who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a member of the Agricultural Corps.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Wall Bennis was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order and ultimately assigned to work as the director of the Marfa-based labs of the Agricultural Corps. Serving the AgriCorps during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Bennis worked with Hestizo Trace in researching flora on the planet. During their work one morning, the bounty hunter Tulkh infiltrated the facility in search for the Murakami orchid on behalf of Darth Scabrous. While Trace was tending to another sections of the facility, Tulkh impaled Trace with a spear. Trace saw Bennis' body impaled on a Malpassian squid pine and attempted to flee before being captured by Tulkh.\nWhile Bennis was gravely injured, Jedi healers were able to treat him in time. Making a full recovery, Bennis bore a scar on his chest where he had been impaled. Bennis greeted Trace when she returned from her imprisonment with the Empire, and encouraged her when she decided to return to Coruscant.",
