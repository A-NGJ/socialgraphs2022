 "content": "Wintag was a Human female who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. She worked as an archivist for the Republic, exploring the ruins of the planet Taris.\nA human female, Wintag began working for the Galactic Republic as an archivist during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. Stationed on Taris, Wintag was working on the Republic Tarisian Archival Database, but she was allergic to something in the air. While based at Waypoint Station Morne, her sickness prevented her from exploring actively herself. She hired a Republic-allied individual to investigate for her. She was searching for the Tarisian government's archive, which was lost in the bombardment, but she finally managed to locate it. The area was overrun with rakghouls, however, and the hero was forced to battle their way through to the archive. The individual discovered that the archive was in fact the members of the government themselves, frozen in carbonite. The individual would inform Wintag's assistant Tiffan Nye in Olaris of the discovery, who began gathering a team to access the archive.\nWintag was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears in Waypoint Station Morne on the Republic version of Taris, where she gives Republic players the mission \"The Archive\".",
