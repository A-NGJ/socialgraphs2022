 "content": "Yerka Mig was a Human male outlaw from the planet Ralltiir who became an Imperial officer, pilot, and bureaucrat. When the Galactic Empire subjugated his homeworld in 1 BBY, Mig resigned and fled in remorse, becoming a fugitive from both Imperial Intelligence and the Imperial Security Bureau and living as a fugitive on Tatooine, where he frequented the planet's Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in 0 BBY.\nThe Human male Yerka Mig hailed from the planet Ralltiir. He joined the Galactic Empire, becoming a pilot and an Imperial officer. Also a bureaucrat with high security clearance, Mig was still serving the Empire when his homeworld was subjugated in 1 BBY. Mig resigned in protest and fled in remorse after Ralltiir's subjugation. With his high security clearance making him a fugitive from both Imperial Intelligence and the Imperial Security Bureau, Mig was forced to live as an outlaw on Tatooine.\nWhile on Tatooine, Mig was known to frequent Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the planet's city of Mos Eisley. In 0 BBY, Mig was in the cantina when a former moisture farmer named Luke Skywalker and a Jedi Master named Obi-Wan Kenobi entered, searching for a pilot to take them and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to the planet Alderaan. Mig witnessed the smuggler Han Solo killing the bounty hunter Greedo before Solo left the cantina.\nYerka Mig fled from the Empire in remorse after his homeworld's subjugation. While he was living as an outlaw on Tatooine and frequenting Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, Mig could not help but smirk at Solo quipping \"sorry about the mess\" to Wuher, the bartender. He had brown hair and fair skin.\nYerka Mig first appeared in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first film of the original trilogy. Uncredited in the film, he was portrayed by actor George Stock, listed as one of the \"bureaucrats.\" Mig's scenes were filmed from April 12 to April 22, 1976 at Elstree Studios's stage 6.\nIn 1995, Decipher, Inc. first named Yerka Mig in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's Premiere Limited set. According to a fan-run website for the game, he was named as an anagram of Decipher employee Mike Gray. In 2002, he was mentioned in The Official Star Wars Fact File 22, where his name was spelled \"Yerke Mig.\"",
