 "content": "Rach'talik was a male Twi'lek, the explosives specialist of Shala the Hutt on Courkrus. In 11 ABY, in an attempt to catch the \"Ghost Jedi\", Shala had Rach'talik rig his warehouse with explosives. Unbeknownst to Shala, Rach'talik betrayed his master in an attempt to surpass him, rigging the explosives in a way so that it would trap Shala long enough for him to know he was betrayed before killing him as well.",
