 "content": "Jeremos was an independent Squib sanitation engineer who operated from a planetary headquarters and took contracts to work on capital ships. She was noted in her field and had many different employers over her career.\nIn 3 ABY, in the months after the Battle of Hoth, Jeremos was hired by the captain of the Imperial Star Destroyer Indomitable, which could not join the rest of the Imperial fleet due to maintenance problems. Jeremos was tasked with scouring the ship's waste bays. In need of some brute strength to lend a hand, the Squib put out a call for workers. After haggling over the pay involved , she hired a group of laborers who, unbeknownst to her, were agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Jeremos took them up in her personal shuttle to board the Imperial craft, where they worked more or less independently.\nOnce on board, the Rebels tried to undermine the Indomitable and further the Alliance agenda. The job was not as smooth as they had hoped, however, as the garbage bays were infested with dianogas and trash bats. One compactor even housed a malfunctioning assassin droid that fired on anything within its line of sight. Despite the inherent danger, Jeremos insisted on carrying the droid out of the ship and salvaging it.\nJeremos did her job with equipment such as a comlink, medpack, survival kit, and metric spanner; she kept this all in her backpack. She owned and operated a shuttle, for which she still owed five payments in 3 ABY.\nShe was something of a cheapskate and wanted to maximize her profit by hiring help at the lowest wage possible.\nJeremos appears in a sidebar of the Rebellion Era Sourcebook from Wizards of the Coast . The segment details an idea for an adventure for gamemasters running a Rebel Alliance campaign. The accompanying material discusses the waste disposal procedures of the Galactic Empire and is inspired by the scene in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back when Han Solo hides the Millennium Falcon among the debris of a star destroyer's garbage.",
