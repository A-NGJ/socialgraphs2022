 "content": "Torphceris was the last Argazdan Regent of the Argazdan Redoubt during the last years of the Kanz Disorders leading up to the Redoubt's dissolution in 3670 BBY\nAround 3670 BBY, Torphceris's grip over the Argazdan Redoubt was threatened by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic under the Lorrdian Jedi Master Mari-Elan Nora. In desperation, he betrayed his \"beliefs\" in Vianism by making a pact with a demonic alien \"artisan-shaper\".\nThe alien had come to the known galaxy from the Intergalactic Void and displayed much expertise in bioengineering. Torphceris used the alien's expertise to create a bioengineered monster which was buried beneath the Slave Pits of Lorrd. These pits were constructed at the cost of the lives of thousands of Lorrdian slaves.\nFollowing the defeat of the Argazdan Redoubt, he may have been killed in the conflict or imprisoned and tried by the Republic. During the Republic Classic era, a play named after him was made about his role in the construction of the Slave Pits by the Lorrdian playwright Pordi zet Chatc. However, he was not portrayed as a villain, but rather as a coward willing to surrender his beliefs for power.",
