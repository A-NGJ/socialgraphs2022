 "content": "Oneron Fil'vye was a Bothan male who owned and operated the shipping company Fil'vye Transport during the Galactic Civil War. His corporate headquarters resided within Fil'vye Transport Tower, which was located off the shores of Streysel Island on the world of Vaynai.\nFil'vye's legitimate business mainly catered toward corporate customers who required the transportation of sensitive cargoes across interstellar distances. This was, however, effectively a cover for his more profitable endeavors; he funded a large number of smuggling operations and was one of the major suppliers of Slick, a substance fermented from seaweed oil that had medicinal properties and could be used as a recreational drug throughout the galaxy.\nThe Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia refers to him as Onoron Fil'vye.",
