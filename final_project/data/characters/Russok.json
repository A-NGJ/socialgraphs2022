 "content": "Russok was a Trandoshan male and the founder and administrator of Nub Saar, the first city built in Genarius.\nRussok was almost fanatical in pushing the city's construction through and was determined that it would succeed. However, there was little interest in the two months after the city was operative.\nHe drew 4,500 people to his city with promises of rewards, confident that he could not be wrong. However, his city was not protected against the radiation and ion storms that were commonplace in the planet.\nWhen the ion storms came, he still would not admit he was wrong, cursing at the 3,500 people who left. He was in the city when the third storm hit, and died with everybody else.",
