 "content": "Liekas Tendo was a Morath mining engineer hostage. Tendo was taken by the Yevetha during the attack. Along with the other hostages taken during the Yevethan Purge, Tendo was forced to record a message begging the New Republic not to fire on Yevethan ships carrying prisoners. The Yevetha played the messages during the Battle of Doornik-319, causing hesitation from the New Republic ships and forcing them to withdraw. Later it was learned by Han Solo, that Tendo and all the other captives of the Yevetha had escaped thanks to the Fallanassi Enara and the Star Morning.",
