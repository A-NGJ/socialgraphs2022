One planet Gethnu was known to visit was Gamorr where the Devaronian would smuggle in illegal goods including poison and dangerous creatures to those who hired them specifically. In 13 ABY when the Jedi Callista Ming was investigating the murder of the Gamorrean Vrokk, and searching for the source of the poison used to kill him, she was told by the poet Sebastin Onyx that Gethnu was one of the people who may of brought the poison onto Gamorr.",
