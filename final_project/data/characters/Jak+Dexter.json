 "content": "Senior Officer Jak Dexter was a male Human terrorism specialist who worked for the Office of Peace and Security, a law enforcement agency that operated on the planet Cularin. In about 31 BBY, the OPS captured a group of freelance agents that had been deceived by the criminal Jarett Hurgen into transporting an illegal explosive device, and the agents were taken to an OPS compound in the city Hedrett, where they were interviewed by Dexter. The agents convinced Dexter of their innocence and after they subsequently tracked Hurgen down for the OPS, Dexter agreed not to press any charges against them.",
