Supposedly the first member of the species to exist after their evolution from a insect species, the individual was rumored to have been the creator a the item of jewellery known as the ClanRing, the holder of which ruled Riileb society. The Ring would traditionally be held by the eldest female member of a group known as the MotherClan who claimed to be direct descendants of the first Riileb.\nThe first Riileb was first mentioned in the thirteenth issue of the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game supplement magazine series Star Wars Adventure Journal published by West End Games in 1997.
