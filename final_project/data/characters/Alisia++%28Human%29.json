 "content": "Alisia was a Human female musician who performed with Alitra, O'choa Detera, Mako, and Mestral in the cantinas aboard both Tansarii Point Station and Nova Orion Station in the Bright Jewel system during the time of the Galactic Civil War. During her time with the band, Alisia played the musical instrument known as the bandfill.\nA Human female by the name of Alisia participated in a band during the time of the Galactic Civil War along with two other musicians, a Human named Mako, and a Zabrak named Alitra. Her band also comprised of two dancers, a Twi'lek named Mestral, and a Zabrak named O'choa Detera. Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Alisia and her band played music and danced for the patrons of the cantina owned by a Twi'lek named Tiarsis in the Tansarii Point Station, a space station located near the planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system. As part of the band, Alisia played the musical instrument known as the bandfill. The Twi'lek entertainer Mira T'rani enjoyed the performance of Alisia's band, which featured two popular songs from Tatooine played by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, \"Mad About Me\" and \"Dune Sea Special\".\nAlisia and her band also divided their time at another space station in the Bright Jewel system known as Nova Orion Station. In addition to the music they played on Tansarii Point Station, Alisia and her band also played two other cover songs belonging to Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, including a Huttese song named \"Lapti Nek\". Despite the band's skill at playing these songs, their lack of original material drew criticism from at least one Nova Orion Industries employee frequenting the cantina.\nAlisia had dark skin, brown hair, and amber colored eyes. She was skilled at using the bandfill to play songs such as \"Mad About Me\" and \"Dune Sea Special\".\nAs a band member at the cantinas of both Tansarii Point Station and Nova Orion Station, Alisia wore revealing clothing, including a yellow and white low cut top, yellow and white hawtpants, and yellow dress slippers. She also wore a yellow hairband to keep a ponytail. As a talented musician, Alisia also possessed and used a musical instrument known as a bandfill.\nAlisia was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Alisia and her band were added to the game with the release of Publish 25's \"New Game Enhancements\" on November 15, 2005, which included a\" New Player Tutorial\" featuring Tansarii Point Station. She could be found in the station's cantina playing music with her band. With the release of \"Chapter 8: The Nova Orion Crisis\" on January 15, 2008, Alisia and her band were also included in the cantina of Nova Orion Station.",
