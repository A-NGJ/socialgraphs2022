 "content": "The House of Solo was a Corellian family that could trace its descent to Prince-Admiral Jonash e Solo. Berethron e Solo ruled the Corellian Empire during the Golden Age of the Old Republic, and introduced democratic reforms that ended the era of monarchy in the Corellian system. After Berethron, the Solo line fell into obscurity and infamy, but some evidence suggests that famous founding hero of the New Republic Han Solo belonged to the House.\nThe first known member of the house was Jonash e Solo, the Corellian Prince-Admiral who ended the Seventeenth Alsakan Conflict. The next known member was Berethron e Solo, who abolished the autocratic power of his own monarchy of the Corellian Empire in 312 BBY through the introduction of democratic reforms.\nAccording to certain records that surfaced at the time of the New Republic, a man named Korol Solo was King Berethron's sixth-generation descendant, but the lineage was lost when records from that period were destroyed in the Clone Wars. C-3PO's research in 8 ABY, however, revealed that Korol Solo fathered his first son, Dalla, on Duro around 52 BBY. When the Clone Wars broke out, Dalla changed his family name to \"Suul.\" He became a notorious criminal kingpin and pirate, and had a son of his own, Jonash Suul.\nHan Solo, an alleged member of the House who was born in poverty to Jonash Solo in 29 BBY, became a celebrated hero of the Rebel Alliance. According to his birth records, he could trace his paternal ancestry to King Berethron through Korol Solo. Further research, however, corroborated by the Coruscant city computer, revealed that Korol Solo was really a pretender to the Corellian throne who was hanged for his crimes. Despite C-3PO's last-minute failure to prove that Han Solo was not of noble lineage, and therefore unsuitable to marry Princess Leia, the head of House of Organa, the wedding went through. Apart from the noble Organas, Solo married into the Skywalker family. As a result of its members' already-legendary accomplishments, the Solo-Skywalker clan was considered one of the most influential famous groupings in history.\nIn 138 ABY, Ania Solo, a descendant of the House of Solo, was working as a junkyard owner in the Carreras system.\nJarik Solo claimed to have been a long-lost cousin of Han Solo. Though Han Solo knew this was not true, he did not tell Jarik that he knew the truth. Instead, Han befriended Jarik and allowed him to continue using the Solo name. When a dying Jarik admitted his imposture, Han told him that he had earned the name.\nDanielle Kieran claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of Han Solo. She imitated the man she believed to be her father by adopting his dress and mannerisms, flying a ship called the Century Hawk, and attempting the Kessel Run.\nHan Solo's family line has been elaborated over the course of various novels, and, at times, certain elements seem contradictory. Daniel Wallace offered this advice to the creator of the Time Tales family tree:\nAgain, this may be explained by the Corellian dating system deriving from a longer year on Corellia, so 11 may be 21 or more if the year is twice standard measure.",
