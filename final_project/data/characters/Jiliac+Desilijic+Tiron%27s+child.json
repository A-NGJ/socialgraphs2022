 "content": "This Hutt was the short-lived offspring of Jiliac Desilijic Tiron, leader of the Desilijic clan in the years preceding the Battle of Yavin. Born in approximately 2 BBY, the Huttling spent its entire life in Jiliac's Winter Palace on Nal Hutta, usually safe inside its mother's pouch, leaving for only several hours at a time. Jiliac was more concerned with parenting than running the Desilijic criminal empire, to the frustration of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, her nephew and right-hand Hutt.\nIn 0 BBY, Durga Besadii Tai, the leader of a rival clan, visited the Winter Palace and invoked the Old Law, which compelled Jiliac to accept a one-on-one mortal confrontation with Durga. With her infant still in its pouch, Jiliac fought Durga, but perished, trapping the child underneath her huge bulk. The Huttlet eventually escaped, only to be crushed to death by Jabba, who wanted no challengers to his inherited leadership of the clan.\nBy approximately 3 BBY, Jiliac Desilijic Tiron had decided to become pregnant for the first time, insisting on being referred to as a female, instead of Jiliac's usual preference to be addressed as a male. Jiliac was leader of the Desilijic clan and its criminal empire, though after she became pregnant her nephew Jabba Desilijic Tiure took over much of the day-to-day running of the clan. Jiliac's pregnancy caused her to appear more corpulent than usual, her size increasing by over a third.\nAfter a year-long pregnancy, Jiliac's first child was born on Nal Hutta. For the first years of its life, the young Hutt had only primitive cognitive abilities, and was immobile for most of the day. Jiliac's newborn spent most of the time in its mother's pouch, leaving only for short periods of time that slowly grew longer as the Huttlet aged. Jiliac did not give her child a name immediately after it was born, but she referred to it as a male; however, others referred to it simple as \"it,\" as the newborn was too young to choose a gender preference itself. Jiliac was very fond of her child, and whenever it emerged from her pouch, she gave it her undivided, affectionate attention. Fearing potential kidnapping attempts, Jiliac expelled most of her subordinates from her Winter Palace residence on Nal Hutta, retaining only her most trusted underlings. She also kept her female gender; Jiliac relished motherhood, despite all the stresses it caused her.\nBecause Jiliac's child received all of its nutrition via its mother, it occupied most of her time, so she could not focus on maintaining the Desilijic clan as much as before. Jiliac began to delegate more and more duties to Jabba, her second-in-command, until he was de facto leader of Desilijic. Even when she wasn't occupied by her child, Jiliac showed little interest in business affairs, a character change Jabba suspected was hormone-related. Jabba felt his aunt was trapped in a \"maternal haze\" that prevented her from looking further than her newborn child. The burden of running the clan, as well as his general dislike for dependent Huttlets, made Jabba grow to loathe Jiliac's offspring.\nAs the months progressed, the Huttlet began to spend more time out of Jiliac's pouch, though the first-time mother never took her eyes off it. Jabba petitioned Jiliac to relocate to Nal Hutta's moon, Nar Shaddaa, but Jiliac refused, citing the adverse affect that Nar Shaddaa's polluted atmosphere would have on her child's health. She also resisted Jabba's attempts to have the child put in a communal nursery, where it would be tended to by surrogate pouch-mothers. Jiliac did briefly leave her \"maternal haze\" in the course of one conversation with Jabba about possible allegiances with Black Sun, but the discussion was interrupted by Jiliac's young child, further intensifying Jabba's hatred for it.\nIn 0 BBY, Durga Besadii Tai, leader of the rival Besadii clan, visited the Winter Palace and challenged Jiliac to a one-on-one mortal confrontation under the terms of the Old Law, as Jiliac had poisoned Durga's father, Aruk Besadii Aora. With her offspring secured in its pouch, Jiliac accepted the challenge and the two Hutts fought, until Durga eventually overcame his opponent, bludgeoning Jiliac to death with his tail. The baby Hutt was trapped under the bulk of its dead mother, eventually emerging several minutes later to face Jabba. Jabba was secure in the knowledge that he would be the new Desilijic leader, but decided to neutralize the potential threat of Jiliac's child out of hatred and the desire to tie up loose ends. He rolled over his helpless cousin, squashing it to death.\nJiliac's child died before it left infancy, so it had little direct influence on the Desilijic clan. However, Jiliac's maternal aversion to business affairs inflicted financial losses on her clan, and her expulsion of most of the Winter Palace's staff left her prone to an attack such as Durga's. Jabba's resentment of Jiliac's relationship with the child also turned him against his aunt, so that he prevented Jiliac's guards from interceding during her brawl with Durga. Had it lived, Jiliac's child could one day have laid claim to leadership of the clan.\nHuttlets were totally dependent on their parent for the first years of their existence, and were capable of only rudimentary cognition. Jiliac's child was killed before it could develop any personal characteristics, but the two beings it had most contact with, Jabba and Jiliac, had polarized opinions about it. Jiliac, as the Huttlet's mother, doted upon the infant and was highly protective of it. She refused to subject the child to the pollution of Nar Shaddaa, or to send it to a communal nursery, and insisted that only those she trusted completely were allowed anywhere near the child. Jabba, however, saw the child and its mother's sentimental opinion of it as a blight to the Desilijic clan, and despised his cousin.\nThe infant resembled a larval form of a Hutt, with mere stubs as arms. It could move around for short periods of time, and liked being rocked by Jiliac's tail; however, this frequently led to the child regurgitating its food.\nJiliac's pregnancy and unborn child were first established in The Hutt Gambit  by A. C. Crispin, the second installment of The Han Solo Trilogy. One year later, Jiliac's newborn appeared in Rebel Dawn, the final novel in Crispin's trilogy. Its death, hinted at in Rebel Dawn, was made explicit in Jabba the Hutt's entry in Daniel Wallace's The New Essential Guide to Characters . The Huttling was also briefly mentioned in Cory J. Herndon's Hutt! Hutt! Hutt! article on Wizards.com in 2003.",
