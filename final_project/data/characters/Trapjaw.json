 "content": "Trapjaw was the name given to a massive wraid that roamed the Dune Sea on the planet Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Trapjaw fed on a number of creatures, including the native sentient Jawas if it came across them, and was eventually slain. During the Feast of Prosperity, Wraid ampulla jelly was harvested from Trapjaw as an ingredient.\nTrapjaw appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011, as the World Boss for the planet Tatooine. This article assumes 100% game completion, and thus assumes that Trapjaw was killed. During the Rakghoul Pandemic World Event in early 2011, Trapjaw was replaced by \"Infected Trapjaw,\" a version of the creature that had been infected by the rakghoul plague. The event only lasted a short time, and Trapjaw was reverted to its standard appearance afterward.",
