 "content": "A human male was in Coruscant and hiding under a sewer grate watching his father be interrogated by stormtroopers. After getting caught the stormtroopers shot his dad and he felt disappointed in himself because he had the shot but failed to shoot them.\nHe enlisted as an X-Wing pilot but on his first mission they told him he'd have to wait 5 years. Unhappy with this decision he jumped onto an X-Wing anyway.\nHe participated in a Dogfight over supply moon where he had the chance to shoot Darth Vader but couldn't. This heavily grieved him.",
