 "content": "Turon Adala was a Human male officer of the Royal Naboo Security Forces during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Pooja Naberrie tasked a spacer with locating Adala and escorting him back to the city of Dee'ja Peak on Naboo. Although the spacer was attacked by stormtroopers and an Imperial staff sergeant, Naberrie's mission was completed.\nTuron Adala was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nPlayers who performed a series of quests for Pooja Naberrie had to locate Adala and escort him safely back to Dee'ja Peak. However, due to a bug, many of the NPCs in Naberrie's quests were not properly sequenced. For instance, in the quest to escort Adala, players actually encountered an individual known as Lim Paddu, who was supposed to appear in the following quest. The character model for Turon Adala likewise erroneously spawned for Naberrie's third quest, in which the player was supposed to encounter an individual named Jumis. Nevertheless, it was possible for the player to complete the mission and advance to the next quest. This article assumes that the content of Naberrie's quest dialogue is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and that Adala, not Lim Paddu, actually appeared during her fourth quest.\nBecause Turon Adala spawned under the generic \"naboo_police\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male. Because the quest dialogue identified Adala as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. Examining the NPC also revealed his name to be Turon Idala. This article assumes \"Adala\" to be the correct surname, as it was consistently used in the quest dialogue. The questline that involved Adala was eventually removed from the game when Pooja Naberrie was relocated to Theed as part of the newly introduced Legacy Quest, released as part of Publish 25's New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005.",
