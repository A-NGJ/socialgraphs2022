 "content": "Elan Sel'Sabagno, also known as Elan Sleazebaggano, was a male Balosar death stick dealer on the planet Coruscant during the Separatist Crisis.\nElan Sel'Sabagno was a male Balosar slythmonger who was present on Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic, during the Separatist Crisis. He tended to tour Coruscant's nightclubs to sell his addictive death sticks. In 22 BBY, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Sel'Sabagno was present in the Outlander Club and attempted to sell his death sticks in the drinks bar to Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was searching for the Clawdite bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Kenobi used a mind trick to convince Sel'Sabagno that he did not want to sell the Jedi any death sticks and instead wanted to go home and rethink his life. By the time Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker were assisting Wesell at the back of the establishment, Sel'Sabagno had already left the club to go home and think over.\nIn the Imperial Era, Sel'Sabagno, by then with a child of his own, passed by a conversation between Leia Organa and Forzaa on Coruscant.\nAlways searching for credits, Elan Sel'Sabagno made his living selling death sticks to patrons of the Outlander Club and other hot spots in the underlevels of Coruscant, targeting both desperate addicts and unwise thrill-seekers. However, Sel'Sabagno was weak-minded, as Obi-Wan Kenobi performed a mind trick on him and convinced him to not sell death sticks to the Jedi Knight and to go home to rethink his life.\nElan Sleazebaggano was portrayed by Matt Doran in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The character was named by Star Wars creator George Lucas. In Star Wars Legends, the character was identified as Elan Sel'Sabagno.\nAlthough Sel'Sabagno's ears were replaced by antennapalps in post-production of Attack of the Clones, the reference photography didn't have the digital alteration, causing early Sleazebaggano toys to have ears instead of antennapalps.",
