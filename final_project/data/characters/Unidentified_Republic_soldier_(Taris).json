 "content": "A human male served as a soldier in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Cold War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He participated in the attempted resettlement of the planet Taris and was friends with an individual named Jessop.\nIn the year 3643 BBY, the Republic soldier asked a Twi'lek doctor about Jessop, who had been bitten by a rakghoul, a type of Sithspawn that roamed Taris. The doctor admitted that he had killed Jessop as the latter had been infected with the rakghoul plague and had been in the process of transforming into a rakghoul himself. Jessop's friend then claimed to feel sick, and the doctor offered to take the soldier to a grief counselor.\nThe soldier had brown hair, blue eyes, and light skin. He wore the green armor that was standard issue for Republic soldiers stationed on Taris. Upon hearing that Jessop had been euthanized, the soldier remarked that he felt ill.\nThe Republic soldier was created for the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by BioWare. In the game, the soldier appears as a non-player character only identified as \"Concerned Soldier.\"",
