 "content": "Slillek was a male Tarasin scout who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was a member of the Hiironi irstat and in circa 31 BBY, Slillek was assigned to guide the Heroes of Cularin to Cularin's Ishkik caverns. En route, they discovered some deceased Tarasin hunters and were attacked by members of the Rock Rogues pirate group. The party subsequently encountered a group of bounty hunters led by the Chagrian Koll Jovas, and they eventually made it to the caverns.",
