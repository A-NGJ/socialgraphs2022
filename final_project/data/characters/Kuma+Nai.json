 "content": "Kuma Nai was a female Kaminoan who was involved in the production of clone troopers for the Galactic Republic, yet was also secretly a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nNai created the Kaminoan nano-virus and planned to spread it to all clone troopers. The plan failed when Jedi Kit Fisto and Aayla Secura arrived to investigate the sickness infecting the clones. As the Kaminoan tried to escape, she became involved in a struggle with Secura. During the melee, she was infected with the nano-virus as she attempted to poison the Jedi and was killed instantly.",
