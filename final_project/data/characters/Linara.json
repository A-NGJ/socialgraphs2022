 "content": "Linara was a human female dancer and girlfriend of Borgin Kaa. At some point after the Battle of Endor, she lived with Borgin in Cloud City on the planet Bespin, where Borgin awaited an implant after suffering heart problems. Borgin was loyal to the Galactic Empire, and believed they could provide him a new heart.\nMembers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic broke into their apartment, seeking Borgin's access panel to infiltrate Governor Ubrik Adelhard's palace and the Iron Blockade. Linara helped the rebels subdue Borgin.\nLinara first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
