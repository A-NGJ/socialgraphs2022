 "content": "Rikka Soto was a female human who lived in the Anoat sector during the Iron Blockade. When her parents, who were both Imperial officers, were shot for purported treason, she went on a vandalism rampage, getting herself arrested in the process. During her transportation to prison, she escaped custody, swearing vengeance against the Galactic Empire. She would later join the crew of the Smuggler during the Anoat Uprising, fighting as a soldier.",
