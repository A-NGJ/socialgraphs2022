 "content": "Tori Radeen was a female Twi'lek biochemist who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nTori Radeen was a biochemist who operated out of Mos Eisley after the Battle of Yavin. She was known among spies for supplying some of the deadliest poisons in the galaxy.\nIn 1 ABY, Tori Radeen asked a spacer working for Jabba the Hutt to go into the cave and bring her the poison glands of bone gnashers that lived in the Krayt Cult Cave. She used the glands to create a new poison for use by Jabba.\nTori Radeen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.\nIn the game, Tori Radeen was part of the quests \"Find Tori\" and \"Bone Gnasher\" which were part of the Legacy quest line, the longest quest line in the game. These quests were featured in the web article \"Jabba's Dirty Work\" and in the Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide. However, Tori Radeen and her quests were eventually removed from the game.",
