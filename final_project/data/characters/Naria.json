 "content": "Naria was a female Twi'lek from Ryloth who resided in a remote village. By the time Drua, a fellow villager, welcomed the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader to the village—unaware of their true identities—Naria was expecting a child, bringing the total number of villagers in her home to thirty-eight. Unbeknown to Naria or the other villagers, the Sith Lords were on a mission to quell the Free Ryloth Movement, and soon Naria and the other villagers witnessed a skirmish between the two factions. To leave no witnesses to the events that transpired, Sidious—the Galactic Emperor—commanded Vader to kill every last villager, including Naria and her unborn child.",
