 "content": "The father of the Galactic Republic soldier Fideltin Rusk was a Chagrian male who lived on the planet Mindor before and during the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A strong pacifist like many of his species, the man married his wife sometime before 3680 BBY, the year the two had their son Fideltin. They raised him in the pacifist colony in which they lived.\nHowever, Rusk rebelled against the colony's ideals and enlisted in the Republic Military as soon as he was of age, and he did not return to the colony throughout the Great Galactic War and the subsequent Cold War. In 3650 BBY, the colony was attacked by the Sith Empire during an incursion into Republic space, and Rusk's parents were killed along with the rest of the colony. In the aftermath of the attack, Rusk's superiors began receiving reports that he became increasingly reckless in battle.\nThe father of Fideltin Rusk, a companion character for the Jedi Knight class in the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, was first mentioned in the Holonet section of the game's official site.",
