 "content": "Jero Jal-Song was a male Meri who lived on the planet Merisee during the reign of the Galactic Empire, where he was a member of the Jedi-worshipping Cult of Those Who Redeem. During the Galactic Civil War, a group of Rebel Alliance agents traveled to Merisee and were attacked by a team of Loag assassins in the city Caronath. However, Jal-Song and eleven other cultists intervened and engaged the Loag in combat, forcing the assassins to withdraw. Afterward, Jal-Song introduced himself to the agents and asked that they promise to keep the existence of the Cult of Those Who Redeem a secret from the Empire.",
