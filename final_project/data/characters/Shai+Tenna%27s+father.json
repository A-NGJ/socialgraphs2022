The Weequay's children had an abusive childhood at the hands of their father, and he placed his sons in leadership positions in his pirate crew. However, Tenna gained control over his family's crew by systematically murdering his brothers, and eventually became a leader in the White Maw pirate group.\nShai Tenna's father was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Shai Tenna in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
