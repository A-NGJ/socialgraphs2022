 "content": "A human male lived on Level 3204 of the city-planet of Coruscant during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He lived on the same level as his niece and nephew, Anandra and Santigo Milon, and their parents, who owned an apartment on Level 3204.\nAfter the destruction of the planet Alderaan by the Empire in 0 BBY, riots broke out on Level 3204, which had a large population of immigrants from Alderaan, including the Milons. During the riots, Reffe, a man who lived next door to Anandra's uncle, was killed by a stormtrooper while ranting about Imperial corruption. When Anandra was later on the run from the Empire, she fought a middle-aged stormtrooper with a scarred face that vaguely reminded her of her uncle.\nAnandra Milon's uncle was first mentioned in \"One Thousand Levels Down,\" a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 on July 22, 2014.",
