 "content": "An unidentified Imperial officer were assigned to Darth Vader's Lambda-class shuttle, during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0 ABY, shorty after the Evacuation of Yavin, the officer came with Vader on his visit to Void Station. When the Sith Lord returned to the docking bay, he quickly asked if Vader was all right, as his armor was damaged. The only response he received was an order to prepare the ship for take-off.",
