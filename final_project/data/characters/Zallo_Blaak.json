 "content": "Zallo Blaak was a human male drifter who traveled to Jedha City on the eve of Reflection Day at the behest of his father, who hoped Blaak might find purpose when peering into the Kyber Mirrors at the Dome of Deliverance. Blaak traveled to the moon Jedha on a transport full of pilgrims and met the Pantoran scholar Kasmira on board.\nOnce in the city, he became swept up in a parade and was nearly trampled by a spamel before Kasmira dragged him to safety. He thanked her and they parted ways, but he later noticed her struggling to pay for a meal after losing her credits and offered to cover the cost. The pair ate together and then again part ways, but met for a fourth time in the Dome of Deliverance on Reflection Day after Blaak saw Kasmira reflected in the Kyber Mirrors. The pair then agreed to explore the city together.\nZallo Blaak appeared in \"Reflection Day\", a short story illustrated by Grant Griffin and published in Life Day Treasury, a 2021 short story collection written by Cavan Scott and George Mann.",
