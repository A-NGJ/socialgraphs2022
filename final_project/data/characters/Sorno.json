 "content": "Sorno was a male Devaronian mercenary in the service of Karagga the Hutt during the Cold War. He served as a bodyguard in Karagga's Palace where he was partnered with the Kaleesh mercenary Jarg. When a strike team attacked the palace, Jarg and Sorno confronted them in the audience chamber. Though adept in combat, Sorno was killed.\nSorno, in conjunction with Jarg, serves as the second boss of Operation: Karagga's Palace in Star Wars: The Old Republic. This article assumes 100% game completion, so he was killed.",
