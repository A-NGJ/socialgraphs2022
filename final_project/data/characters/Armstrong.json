 "content": "Chief Armstrong was a male Mustafarian in charge of running the Mensix Mining Facility on the planet Mustafar. Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, he was worried about his mining crews, as they were being lost due to trilom gas poisoning. Because the gas drove his miners mad, he asked an individual to help put them out of their misery. The individual managed to wipe out all infected miners, and came back to Armstrong. He rewarded the individual with a Mustafarian Modified Disruptor Pistol, and then set about burying his dead.\nArmstrong was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
