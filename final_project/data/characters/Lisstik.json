 "content": "Lisstik was a male Kamarian Badlander who served as a leader for his people in 2 BBY. That year, Corellian smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee partner Chewbacca visited the Kamar Badlands while repairing their starship, the Millennium Falcon, and Lisstik traded with the pair of rare outsiders. Solo and Chewbacca started a business repeatedly showing the holodocumentary Varn, World of Water to the primitive Badlanders, most of whom had never seen anything of the sort in their lives. Lisstik, who was rare among his people in that he spoke some Basic, was one of the few to come the first night, and continued to appear every night thereafter as Solo's holos quickly became a sensation among the Badlanders.\nTo Solo and Chewbacca's shock, a cult surrounding the holo began to spring up among the Badlanders who were awed by its depiction of a watery world wildly different from the desolate Badlands. Lisstik took a place as sort of high priest, wearing a burned-out part from the Falcon as a sign of his office. When the two smugglers changed the holo to the musical drama Love is Waiting one night, a riot sprung up among their ersatz congregation, who attacked Lisstik and the visitors in their fury and forced Solo and Chewbacca to flee.\nLisstik first appeared in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979.",
