 "content": "Wurrooba was a Wookiee who worked for Starwind Chandlery, a small general store and starship outfitter, that was located in the market of the space station StarForge Station, as of 0 ABY. Wurrooba, along with a Human named Mioe, clerked the store, while the Devaronian Labio managed it.\nWurrooba first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit. The Far Orbit Project did not provide a gender for Wurrooba.",
