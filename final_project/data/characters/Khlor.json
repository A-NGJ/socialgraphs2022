 "content": "Khlor was a highly skilled bounty hunter who specialized in live capture and tracking. Adorned in dark clothes and a full-body cloak, and with a jet-black Velusian fursnake named Sting coiled around his neck and shoulders, he presented a harrowing image to client and prey alike.\nHe specialized in nonlethal weaponry, employing stun grenades, magna bolas, electro-nets, blowguns, and a modified R-88 suppressor riot rifle to capture his marks alive. He piloted a modified scout ship, Predator, and maintained a base on Velusia which he kept stocked with deadly predators and poisonous organismsâ€”and the occasional freelance merc, kidnapped and let loose on the island to provide Khlor with a little practice between jobs.",
