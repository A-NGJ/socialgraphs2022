 "content": "This male Pau'an served as an interrogator for the Galactic Empire sometime around 0 ABY. When Princess Leia Organa was captured by the Empire on the planet Delaya, the Pau'an was tasked to interrogate Organa to learn the identity of the Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Before he could begin though, the Imperial base sounded its alarms due to intruders. Leaving Organa strapped to a durasteel slab, the Pau'an went out of the interrogation room to investigate when he was shot in the head by the Imperial assassin X-7, who was working undercover with the Rebels to also learn the identity of the Death Star's destroyer.",
