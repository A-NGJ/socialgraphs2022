 "content": "Thromba was a Frigosian female who worked as a cryptosurgeon in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata. Along with her partner Laparo, she offered cosmetic surgery to her clients, including the criminal Ryn Biggleston. Her lab was destroyed when the forces of the First Order attacked and demolished Kanata's castle following the destruction of the Hosnian system.\nThromba was a Frigosian female from Tansyl 5 who worked in partnership with her fellow Frigosian Laparo as a cryptosurgeon around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. The pair rented out a tower in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana, and there offered cosmetic surgery to those who wanted to disappear. When the criminal Ryn Biggleston hired the services of Thromba and Laparo after killing her partner in crime BeeLee Amdas, the pair transformed Biggleston's appearance to that of Amdas without her knowing and stole a hoard of credits she had hidden near the castle. The patient then fled without paying, but was soon arrested when the criminal Amdas' appearance was recognized.\nThromba and Laparo were later present in the castle's main hall when the smuggler Han Solo entered with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8. Soon after the group's arrival, many of the castle's occupants raced outside to watch the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon, after which forces of the First Order attacked and destroyed Kanata's castle and the cryptosurgeon's lab with it.\nThromba first appeared in \"The Face of Evil\", a short story written by Landry Q. Walker as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a multi-media campaign leading up to the release of the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens later that year in 2015. She and Laparo then appeared as minor characters in the film itself portrayed by Annabelle Davis.",
