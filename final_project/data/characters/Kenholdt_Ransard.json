 "content": "Kenholdt Ransard was a human male who was the spiritual leader and distillate maker in his home village on the planet Savareen. His tongue was cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate when he and the other villages stood up to them; however, he was still able to maintain an effective silent communications network. In 10 BBY, he was present when the Cloud-Riders and a group of criminals formerly affiliated with Crimson Dawn joined together with the villagers to oppose the syndicate.\nRansard was a human male who lived in a village constructed in the ruins of the Bis Refinery on the Pnakotic Coast of his homeworld Savareen. Like the other inhabitants of the village, he had had his tongue cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate after the villagers stood up to the criminals and refused to pay tribute. He was the spiritual leader and the best distillate maker, his technique produced the best savareen brandy in the village.\nKenholdt Ransard first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first named in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
