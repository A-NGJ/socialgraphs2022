 "content": "Eckhorn Baliss was an Alderaanian noble and member of House Baliss who served as a spy for the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. In his capacity as a Republic statesman, the Human male observed other members of the government and eventually compiled a list of Imperial sympathizers that the Empire could potentially turn into double agents, and he hid this list in his house's estate. However, one of these sympathizers—the husband of Senator Verre Sydia, who unbeknownst to Baliss was also an Imperial operative—hired the bounty hunter Terrin Sandafar to kill Baliss.\nAs was her style, Sandafar killed Baliss by rigging his ship to explode in 3663 BBY above his homeworld Alderaan, a seemingly accidental event that was later investigated by the former slaver Shafu on behalf of Jedi Master Ven Zallow. Shafu was killed by Sandafar as well, but his death and Baliss' were investigated by the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython and the astromech droid T7-O1.\nEckhorn Baliss was first mentioned in the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he is the subject of several conversations with the Jedi Knight companion character T7-O1.",
