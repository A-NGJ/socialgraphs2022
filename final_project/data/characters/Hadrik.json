 "content": "Hadrik was a Force-sensitive Gormak Shaman who lived on Voss during the Cold War. He was one of the only Gormak capable of using the Force, specifically an ability known as Dream-walking. However, he kept this a secret, as Gormak believed all things to do with the Force was corruption and must be destroyed. Hadrik always wanted to fly off-world to avoid his species' conflict with the Voss, as he believe the Gormak could achieve much more if they stopped fighting the Voss and each other. The Gormak King, Jokuul, had him imprisoned for his beliefs. His chance for freedom arrived in the form of a Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire, Kallig, who arrived on Voss in search of a cure for their Force walk sickness. Hadrik helped Kallig with a cure, and in exchange Kallig transported Hadrik out of his homeworld despite the objections of the Voss Mystics, who claimed there would be dire consequences if a Gormak were allowed to reach the stars.",
