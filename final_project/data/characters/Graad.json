 "content": "Graad was a Human male Mandalorian, who lived on the planet Mandalore—the cultural homeworld of the Mandalorians, located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories—by the start of the Second Galactic Civil War. Donning purple-plated Mandalorian armor, Graad attended a gathering of clan chieftains and other prominent Mandalorians at MandalMotors Hall in Keldabe, the capital city of Mandalore, in the year 40 ABY. A proponent of the kadikla movement, Graad spoke out in favor of focusing not on the war between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, but on rebuilding Mandalore in the wake of the damage incurred by the Yuuzhan Vong more than a decade prior. It was Graad's urging that convinced Mand'alor Boba Fett to recall two million Mandalorians living throughout the galaxy back to Mandalore, and to commit financial aid to the reconstruction efforts.\nGraad was a Human male Mandalorian, living on the Outer Rim world of Mandalore by the time of the Second Galactic Civil War. In the year 40 ABY, Graad attended a gathering at MandalMotors Hall, a communal building located within Mandalore's capital city, Keldabe. There, alongside numerous other clan chieftains, heads of Mandalorian companies, and other prominent Mandalorian soldiers, Graad met with the reigning Mand'alor Boba Fett to discuss the state of Mandalore and determine its role in the emerging conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation. Skeptical of Fett's ability to lead them as Mand'alor, when Fett decreed that Mandalore would be officially neutral in the war, while still permitting individuals to take up mercenary work if they so chose, Graad spoke out against the division such a decision could cause, stating that any chance of having Mandalorian-against-Mandalorian conflict was a detriment to the restoration of Mandalore in the wake of the damage incurred during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong more than a decade ago.\nThough Graad's Mandalorian contemporary, Baltan Carid, had argued against his criticisms, Graad's words managed to influence the Mand'alor. At his urging, Fett elected to issue a call for two million Mandalorians living throughout the galaxy to journey to Mandalore in order to help bolster the population level that had suffered due to the Yuuzhan Vong's attack, and to repair the damage that continued to prevail in its wake. Fett also pledged financial support, matched by donations from the MandalMotors company. Graad's hopes were realized in the following months, as Mandalorians from across the Outer Rim returned to Mandalore, discovering a fresh lode of beskar iron near the town of Enceri, revitalizing fallow farms that had been left abandoned following the battle with the Yuuzhan Vong, and raising the planet's population back to pre-war levels.\nGraad was critical of Boba Fett's tenure as Mand'alor, and did not believe the bounty hunter was the best choice to hold the position at the time. Graad was also a vocal proponent of kadikla, a nationalist Mandalorian movement spearheaded by Venku Skirata—also known by the nickname of Kad'ika—that espoused the need for Mandalorians to establish the Mandalore sector as a strong, unassailable power base that would allow the Mandalorians the option to fight as they chose, rather than force them to rely on outsider mercenary contracting to make a living. He was known for slipping into lengthy diatribes preaching kadikla's merits on occasion, and was willing to aggressively debate the issue with his fellow Mandalorians, even the Mand'alor, the traditional leader of all the Mandalorian clans; Graad sometimes used sarcasm to illustrate his points during an argument.\nA man of average height and build, Graad spoke the Mandalorian language of Mando'a, and Galactic Basic Standard with an accent comprised of both Coruscanti and Keldabe inflections. He wore Mandalorian armor colored primarily purple and black, though his left shoulder plates was a light metallic brown.\nThe Mandalorian known as Graad was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the fifth entry in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel series, entitled Sacrifice; authored by Karen Traviss, the Sacrifice was published May 29, 2007. Graad later received an informational entry in the 2008 reference book, The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
