 "content": "Gruthashaal was a female Human Nightsister during the time of the Galactic Civil War. She somehow obtained a lightsaber which Singular Nak attempted to buy from her. She did not accept his offer, however, and so he paid an individual to get the lightsaber from her, lying to the individual and saying that she had stolen it from him. The individual killed her, giving the lightsaber to Nak.\nGruthashaal was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
