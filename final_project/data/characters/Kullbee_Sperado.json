 "content": "Kullbee Sperado was a male Meftian gunslinger who was recruited by rebel leader Saw Gerrera to join his Partisans while on Serralonis.\nRunning from a past that he refused to speak about, he was intensely private and would disappear for weeks at a time. In the year 0 BBY, he and the rest of the Partisans were based in the Catacombs of Cadera on the moon Jedha, where Sperado was sometimes spotted praying at the Temple of the Kyber in Jedha City.\nShortly after the Partisans captured a group including Gerrera's adoptive daughter Jyn Erso in the city, they were forced to evacuate from the catacombs after the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon destroyed Jedha City, creating a blast wave that also destroyed the catacombs. Some time after surviving these events, Sperado and Cycyed Ock found their way to the opposite hemisphere of the moon. After discovering a smuggler's guide left behind by Shesslaria, the two left Jedha in hopes of finding Maz Kanata's treasure on Iskalon. While initially seizing the treasure, they were soon captured and thrown into Megalox Beta Penitentiary.\nKullbee Sperado first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016. He was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day. He was portrayed by Robert Nairne, who also played Cycyed Ock in the film.\nSperado's name is a combination of his production nickname, \"Skullbeard,\" with the word \"desperado\" because he looked like a gunslinger from the Old West.",
