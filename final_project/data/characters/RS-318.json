 "content": "RS-318 was a human stormtrooper who served in the 709th Legion of the First Order military regime. RS-318 was stationed on the Outer Rim planet Batuu during the First Order's occupation there in 34 ABY. The stormtrooper conversed via datapad with fellow trooper CF-8011, who was wondering what the First Order was doing on Batuu. RS-318 responded that the trooper had no clue why they were stationed on a planet with what the stormtrooper believed to be filled with lowlifes and smugglers. RS-318 wore standard First Order stormtrooper armor with a white pauldron.\nRS-318 appeared in Star Wars: Datapad, an application launched alongside the themed land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios Park in 2019.",
