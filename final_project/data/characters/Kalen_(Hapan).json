 "content": "Kalen was the elder brother of Prince Isolder of the Hapes Cluster.\nAs the elder son of Ta'a Chume, Kalen was the Chume'da of the Hapes Consortium, and if he were to marry in the future, his wife was expected to reign.\nGrowing up, Kalen and Isolder were close, and Kalen would often sing songs to Isolder to comfort him when he was frightened. However, as Kalen grew older, his mother felt that he lacked the necessary skills to be a leader to his people.\nIn 2 ABY, Kalen was captured near the Terephon system by Harravan and his group of pirates. Instead of holding Kalen for ransom, the pirates murdered him. Overcome with grief over losing his brother and looking for a way to avenge him, this event triggered Isolder to go undercover as a privateer for two years to search for those responsible.\nIt was revealed to Isolder six years later that it was his mother who had orchestrated Kalen's death on political grounds.\nSome sources, such as the StarWars.com Databank, refer to this individual as Kalan.",
