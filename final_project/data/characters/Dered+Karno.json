 "content": "Dered Karno was an alien mercenary who, alongside Ommo Twilto, worked as an enforcer. Karno wielded an electroprod staff.\nKarno wore a dark red shirt with a brown belt, pants, gloves and boots as well as a gray helmet and armor made of plastoid tiles wrapped in leather padding. The alien had brown skin and black eyes and black, braided hair.\nDered Karno was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. The book includes Karno in a section on the planet Pasaana, although the character is not present in any scenes on the planet in the film. Karno's name is a partial anagram of the name of actor Derek Arnold, who portrayed Karno in the film and referred to the character as Dovine on set. Arnold stated that everything about Twilto and Karno and their appearance in The Visual Dictionary made completing the sequel trilogy worthwhile.",
