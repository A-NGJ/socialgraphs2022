 "content": "CT-44/444, also known as Forry, was a clone trooper who served in the Galactic Republic's Ord Cestus Squad during the Clone Wars. He specialized in physical training. Along with his fellow clone troopers Seefor and Sirty, Forry attempted to stop Captain Nate from violating their code by not following the instructions given to them by Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Kit Fisto. When Nate tried to leave, Forry and Nate squared off with Nate winning with a blow to Forry's jaw.\nHe helped Fisto and Nate train the commandos of the Desert Wind terrorist group, and was among the survivors who managed to escape their lair when Asajj Ventress sent a group of infiltration droids to destroy them. When Nate's body was not recovered, they feared that Nate had been killed or that he had broken the Code and betrayed them in the first place.",
