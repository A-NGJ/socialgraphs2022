 "content": "A Rodian male was an associate of the Dowutin bounty hunter Grummgar. He was based at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana. Following the Quest for the Kyber Saber Crystals, Kordi Freemaker tried to barter an ion projector for a Type A vector coil. The Rodian merchant contemptuously gave them a Type Two power cell. When Rowan Freemaker protested that he was ripping them off, the Rodian told him to take up the matter with his associate Grummgar. Kordi tried to sweet talk Grummgar but the Dowutin was in no mood to negotiate. As a result, the Freemakers had to leave with the Type Two power cell.\nThis male Rodian merchant had green skin and black eyes. Rowan regarded him as an unscrupulous trader. The Rodian was known to use the Dowutin bounty hunter Grummgar as heavy muscle when negotiations did not go well.\nThe unidentified Rodian merchant first appeared as a minor character in the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two animated short \"Home One\", which was released on the LEGO Star Wars website on May 4, 2017. He was voiced by Jeff Bennett.",
