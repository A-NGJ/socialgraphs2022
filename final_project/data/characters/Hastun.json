 "content": "Hastun was a human pilot who flew a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter for the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. Two weeks after the Battle of Endor, which saw the death of the Galactic Emperor and a decisive victory for the Rebel Alliance in 4 ABY, the 204th was tasked with the destruction of all civilization on the planet Nacronis as part of Operation: Cinder, an Imperial contingency plan instigated by the Emperor's death.\nHastun took part in the genocide, flying with a squadron led by Captain Nosteen. The squadron was assigned to protect 204th TIE/sa bombers, which dropped vortex detonators on Nacronis to stoke its siltstorms, from defending Alliance forces. The surface of Nacronis was subsequently devastated by the siltstorms, with Hastun's squadron suffering multiple casualties during the mission.\nHastun was mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the initial instalment of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy written by Alexander Freed.",
