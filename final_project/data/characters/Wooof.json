 "content": "Wooof was a Kadas'sa'Nikto who served the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Having previously worked as a smuggler, the Nikto was placed in charge of the fleet of skiffs Jabba kept at his palace on the planet Tatooine as well as the crime lord's sail barge Khetanna. In 4 ABY, Wooof was walking across Jabba's throne room in front of the frozen form of the smuggler Han Solo when the Hutt declared that he would not bargain for Solo's freedom after hearing a holographic message of the Jedi Luke Skywalker in which Skywalker asked to negotiate for the release of the smuggler.\nWooof was present in Jabba's throne room when the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker arrived to try and negotiate the release of his friend Han Solo. The Nikto later traveled on board Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon to witness Skywalker, Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca's execution, but was killed by Skywalker's lightsaber after the Jedi broke free.\nWooof was played by Mike Stevens in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the Star Wars original trilogy. Although the character was named Klaatu during production, he was officially renamed Wooof, as revealed in Leland Chee's Keeper of the Holocron blog on Facebook.com.\nWooof's original name, Klaatu, was taken from Klaatu barada nikto, a phrase from the 1951 film The Day The Earth Stood Still.\nThe film makers originally intended to use Wooof as the rancor keeper; however, on October 30, creature designer Phil Tippett received a telex stating that the keeper would now be a human and so the Wooof mask would not need to be articulated to cry.",
