So Arko Santis and Eomin Dessain decided a marriage between Arko's oldest son Brom Santis and Oma Dessain. Oma got kidnapped by Eomin's servant Betolo without anybody knowing. This led to both families accusing each other. She was kept hostage in kainnan near a volcano until Hawk Ryo rescued her. In the end she didn't want to marry Brom Santis, but she did become a foster child in the Santis household later on.",
