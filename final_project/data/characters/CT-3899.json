 "content": "CT-3899, nicknamed \"Rookie\", was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic.\nOn his first assignment, CT-3899 was placed under command of sergeant Kano on Ryloth in the aftermath of the liberation of the planet's capital, Lessu. Commanded by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, Kano, CT-3899 and other rookie troopers were tasked with cleaning the remaining pockets of Separatist resistance from the city of Resdin. CT-3899 was extremely eager to put his training to the test and show his brother what he was made of. After the last pocket of droids was wiped out, Kano congratulated the shinies on completing their first assignment and commented on them not being shinies anymore.",
