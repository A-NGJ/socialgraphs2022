 "content": "Kordren was a male Cerean who served as a member of the Techrats, along with Skeel and Maj-Odo-Nomor during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nHe was named after the Cerean mythological giant Kordren.\nKordren was one of the many people who have contributed to the development of advanced technologies on Cerea and rebelled against their parents' generation. In 33 BBY, he joined the Techrats and would often race his illegal swoop in the Outsider Citadel. During the incident, Kordren and Skeel lost control over their machines and crashed. While Skeel died on the spot, Kordren was sent to the hospital and died shortly from his injuries.",
