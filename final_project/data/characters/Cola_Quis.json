 "content": "Cola Quis was a male Twi'lek, senator of Ryloth to the New Republic and member of the Commerce Council.\nQuis served the New Republic during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy.\nLater, after the Battle of Coruscant, Quis managed to reach Mon Calamari, where the New Republic regrouped. Due to the death of the Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya, a new campaign to choose a Chief of State began, and Quis was nominated as one of the candidates along with Cal Omas, Fyor Rodan and Ta'laam Ranth. Though Quis did began with a good lead, it was soon obvious that he would never get the post: The race was mainly among the other three candidates.\nThe initial results gave thirty-five percent of the votes to Rodan; twenty-eight percent to Omas; eighteen percent to Ranth and ten percent to Quis. There were some abstentions and a few votes scattered among other minor candidates, surprisingly including Pwoe. Senator of Kashyyyk Triebakk  tried to convince Quis to give his votes to Omas, as it was clear that Quis couldn't win. Rodan also tried to get Quis' votes.\nRanth increased his percentage to twenty-two, being then able to deliver the election to one of the main candidates, while Quis dropped out of the race when Omas promised to name him chairman of the Commerce Council and give midlevel ministry jobs to several of his friends, and an office of the Kellmer Institute of Higher Learning for Ryloth.",
