 "content": "Bloodskin was a Flesh Raider who lived on Tython during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. Bloodskin and other Flesh Raiders were organized into an army by the Dark Jedi Bengel Morr around 3643 BBY. Bloodskin was killed by a Republic-affiliated individual at some point during the conflict between the Flesh Raiders and the Jedi Order.\nBloodskin appears in the BioWareâ€“LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Tython. Bloodskin is not directly involved in any quests, however they can be killed by any Republic-affiliated character as part of the achievement \"Liberator of Tython\". This articles assumes 100% game completion, which means Bloodskin was killed.",
