 "content": "Magar was a male Human member of the Balmorran resistance during the Galactic War and the husband of Danla Zin. Along with some friends he had stolen Imperial uniforms and tried to infiltrate the Nebula Research Base in the Gorinth Canyon. Unfortunately for them, at the same time the base was being assaulted by the Voidhound and Corso Riggs who, upon seeing Imperials in uniform, opened fire and killed the men on the spot.\nMagar appears as an \"Imperial Officer\" in the game. Only after the player kills him, does the dialogue reveal that it was merely a disguise.",
