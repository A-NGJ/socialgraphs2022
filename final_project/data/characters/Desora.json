 "content": "Desora was a Pureblood Sith female who served the Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nIn 3640 BBY she and a fellow Sith Chane were send by the Imperial Admiral Harridax Kirill to follow a smuggler to Rogun Matt'rik's safe house on Tatooine. The smuggler planned to kill Rogun for their past mis-dealings, unaware that they were mostly orchestrated by Kirill, aka the Voidwolf, whom the smuggler unwittingly helped. Chane and Desora interrupted the argument between the two and after revealing the deception via hologram, Kirill ordered the Sith to rid him of assets he no longer needed. However, the smuggler and Rogun decided to team up despite past differences and managed to defeat both of the Sith.",
