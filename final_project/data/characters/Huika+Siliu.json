 "content": "Huika Siliu was the mother of Pendra Siliu, a girl rescued by Jyn Erso during an attack by the Partisans in Holy City on Jedha.\nHuika Siliu was a human woman who lived with her husband Larn Siliu and their daughter Pendra Siliu in the capital of the desert moon Jedha in the middle of the border. Before the Galactic Civil War erupted, Jedha was under control of the Galactic Empire where the Imperials were stealing the Kyber crystals there, which they mined to develop a new super weapon. The resistance fighter Saw Gerrera and his Partisans opposed the Empire on Jedha, which always caused unrest. In 0 BBY, Huika and Pendra were present when Saw Gerrera's Partisans attacked a stormtrooper patrol. During the sudden attack, Huika was separated from her daughter, who stopped in the crossfire and cried loudly. This made her aware of the Jyn Erso, who rushed to the girl's aid and brought her back to her mother. They left the danger zone and at home she told her husband about the selfless stranger. Some time later, Huika was on the road and Larn had to work, which is why he wanted to bring Pendra to her aunt Jola. He thought about asking Huika again soon to leave the planet for her safety, but for the time being satisfied that she would be home safely in the evening. However, in the course of the city's destruction by the new super weapon, the Death Star, the two were killed before they could leave for Jola.\nHuika Siliu was portrayed by Shina Shihoko Nagai in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
