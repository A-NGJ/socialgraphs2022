 "content": "Jerik Snivas was a former investigator for Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations . He worked many years and was promoted to an important position in the local office on Kwenn Space Station. However, years of shady dealings led him to leave IOCI to avoid being investigated and prosecuted. He became a free-lance expediter where his connections allowed him to stay in business.\nHe was not particularly interesting, but had an intense personality and tendency to chatter non-stop which would often cause people to be drawn to him. He was utterly selfish and cared only for credits. He believed information was valuable, and he was a master at trading it.",
