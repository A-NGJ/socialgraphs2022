 "content": "Swilja Fenn was a female Twi'lek Jedi Knight in the New Jedi Order and a member of Clan Fenn.\nFenn was named after Twi'lek legendary princess Swilja, known for her beauty.\nDuring the Yuuzhan Vong War, Swilja was pursued and caught by Peace Brigadiers on Cujicor. She had been dumped on a nameless moon for the Yuuzhan Vong to collect. They transported her to Warmaster Tsavong Lah, who congratulated her on proving herself worthy of honored sacrifice, to which Swilja tried to lash out and attack Lah but to no avail.\nLah asked her to help deliver Jacen Solo to him. When she refused, instructing him to \"Eat poodoo\", he turned her over to interrogaters, and finally killed her personally.\nDuring her imprisonment and torture with the Yuuzhan Vong, Swilja was ready to embrace the dark side, but due to their blindness to the Force, knew even that would be ineffectual.\nDuring the Jedi conclave on Yavin 4, Kyp Durron used her death and others, to argue for a more aggressive resistance to the Yuuzhan Vong.\nA female Twi'lek with fair skin appeared in the Star Wars: Union comics. When queried about this on the StarWars.com forums, Leland Chee initially said this could be Swilja, followed by a later comment saying this is probably Swilja.",
