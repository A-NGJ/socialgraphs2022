 "content": "U'il was a Falleen female who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, and was a friend of Princess Leia Organa. In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance became aware of a mole within its ranks after all of but three of its informants were killed. U'il, posing as a bodyguard under the name Grega, was sent to ensure that one of the informants, a Duros named Bot was recovered by smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, who had been sent by Organa and General Airen Cracken to retrieve the three rebel informants. Afterwards, U'Il was sent to retrieve the Elomin Aran, and brought him to Solo's starship, the Millennium Falcon whilst being chased by the Galactic Empire, though they managed to board and escape. Eventually the Millennium Falcon made it back to the Alliance, where U'il revealed that she had been in possession of the Alliance's information all along.",
