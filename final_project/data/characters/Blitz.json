 "content": "\"Blitz\" was the nickname of a Clone ARC Commander in Rancor Battalion. He, along with fellow ARC Commander Colt and ARC Commander Havoc, oversaw clone trooper training during the Clone Wars.\nBlitz like all clones was created on the aquatic planet of Kamino, from the DNA of the late bounty hunter Jango Fett. During the Clone Wars he served as an ARC trooper with the military rank of Clone Commander, and was placed in Rancor Battalion. During the Clone Wars, he was stationed on Kamino and oversaw clone trooper training with ARC Commanders Colt, Havoc, and another ARC trooper. He later participated in the Battle of Kamino, and when Separatist Trident drills attacked, he led three Advanced Recon Force Scout Troopers to destroy them. Blitz and another ARC trooper were the only survivors of the few ARCs that participated in the battle.\nBlitz first appeared in the episode \"Clone Cadets,\" albeit unidentified. He was first identified in the new Star Wars canon, on the card Clone ARC Commander Blitz, released as part of the Rank \u0026 File set on the Star Wars: Card Trader app in 2018. In the Legends continuity he was first identified by the Star Wars: The Clone Wars toy line set Defend Kamino.",
