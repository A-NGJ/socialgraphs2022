 "content": "A male Abyssin, Cyceyed was an aggressive individual who was known to visit Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina during the year 1 ABY. During one particular visit, Cyceyed pulled a knife on his fellow patron Arleil Schous. However, before Cyceyed could do anything with it, he was pulled away from his seat by the cantina's bouncer, Tork, and was forcibly ejected from the bar.\nA male Abyssin, Cyceyed was an aggressive individual who was known to be on the planet of Tatooine. During the year 1 ABY, Cyceyed visited Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, located in Mos Eisley, a large spaceport. He found a table, and had a drink alongside a Defel, Arleil Schous. During his visit, the Galactic Empire began to broadcast a live holodocumentary, referred to as Life on Tatooine. The broadcast reached the planet of Kashyyyk, where the Wookiees Mallatobuck, Lumpawaroo, and Attichitcuk watched the footage from their home alongside the Imperials who had come to visit them. The feed switched to a camera installed in the cantina. While on camera, Cyceyed became argumentative with Schous, and he eventually pulled a knife out from under his clothes. After threatening the Defel, who continued to argue, the bar's bouncer, Tork, grabbed the Abyssin from behind, lifting him from his seat. Although Cyceyed tried to break free, emitting a high-pitched scream at the same time, he could not escape Tork's grasp, and he was forcibly ejected from the cantina. A little while later, the rest of the cantina emptied after the Imperials issued a curfew.\nCyecyed had a temper, and could grow to be very aggressive, going as far as to brandish a weapon at someone who he disagreed with. However, when he pulled his knife on Schous, he was promptly thrown from the establishment. Although he tried to wrestle himself free from the bouncer's grasp, the Abyssin was not strong enough to do so. Cyceyed had white hair and mottled brown skin. His teeth were yellow and unkempt. The Abyssin's single eye had a black iris, although he kept his eye closed during his encounter with Schous, not that it affected his ability to point his knife at the Defel.\nCyceyed first appeared in The Star Wars Holiday Special, which was released in the year 1978. His name was eventually confirmed on the Star Wars Blog article, The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who. Cyceyed's mask is actually the very same mask seen in the film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, where it was used for the cantina patron named Myo. Extra hair was added onto the mask for the special, however. Although the mask featured the ability to open and close its eye, Cyceyed's eye was closed throughout the special.",
