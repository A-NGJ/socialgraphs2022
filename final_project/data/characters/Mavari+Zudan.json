 "content": "Mavari Zudan was a female Falleen judge on the Court of Justice in 43 ABY.\nMavari Zudan was a female Falleen judge in the Galactic Alliance Court of Justice in 43 ABY. She was the judge during Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker's trial in 43.5 ABY. During Skywalker's case she agreed to his terms for exile.\nLater, she was the judge during the trial of Jedi Knight Valin Horn, and ruled that he was not competent to stand trial, but that he would be encased in carbonite, as he was too dangerous to be placed in a conventional prison. She later judged ex-Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila's trial, and sentenced her to death.\nDespite the fact that she upheld the charges that Chief of State Natasi Daala brought against Skywalker, Zudan seemed to be somewhat sympathetic to the Jedi cause. This would change later, however, as the courts ruled that Valin Horn was too dangerous to be put in a conventional prison; opting instead to contain him in carbonite.",
