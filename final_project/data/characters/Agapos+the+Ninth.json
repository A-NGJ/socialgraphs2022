 "content": "Agapos the Ninth or Agapos IX was a male Sunesi and the ninth of the Priest-Princes of Monor II. He ascended to the throne after his father Agapos the Eighth. Agapos was Force-sensitive and a follower of The Maker.\nHe believed that his powers in the Force were given to him by the Maker. Agapos was a vocal critic of the Galactic Empire, criticizing their mining of cirrifog. The Empire put a death mark on Agapos for his comments, and he was forced into hiding to avoid bounty hunters.\nEventually, Agapos was found by the bounty hunters Tinian I'att and Chenlambec. Chen was secretly working against the Empire and decided to smuggle Agapos off of Monor II. Chen deposited the fugitive on Tekra Point where he continued his musings in philosophy. Agapos's writings became very popular with the worlds within the New Republic. Eventually, Daye Azur-Jamin tracked Agapos to Tekra Point to question the whereabouts of his lost love, Tinian.\nAgapos eventually stepped down as Priest-Prince of Monor II so that his son, Agapos the Tenth, could take the position.",
