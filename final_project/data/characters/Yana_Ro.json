 "content": "Yana Ro was an Evereni female who lived around 382 BBY. She was the cousin of Marda Ro. As young children, their grandparents and Yana's sire were killed in an attack, and their respective mothers fled with them to the planet Dalna. The family became members of the Path of the Open Hand, a cult that worshipped the Force.\nEventually, the Nautolan Kor Plouth, daughter of the Path leader Werth, became Yana Ro's girlfriend. When Ro reached the Path's age of choosing, fifteen years old, she began discussing with Plouth her desire to leave Dalna and the Path. The couple also became part a group called the Children, which \"liberated\" Force artifacts for the Path's spiritual leader, the Mother, via theft; other members of the Path believed the Children were proselytizing off-world.",
