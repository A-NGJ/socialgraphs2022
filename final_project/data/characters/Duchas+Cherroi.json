 "content": "Duchas Cherroi was a human TIE fighter pilot in Squadron Three of the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing during the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the New Republic. Around 5 ABY, while the fighter wing was stationed aboard the Quasar Fire-class cruiser carrier Aerie, Cherroi had a competition with the 204th's Squadron Five, but fell behind. The Imperial pilot's efforts were discussed by another pilot in the Aerie's mess hall, which was briefly overheard by the fighter wing's commanding officer Major Soran Keize as he headed for a meeting. Cherroi shared an intimate relationship with fellow Squadron Three pilot Gargovik, who were often seen together between missions.\nDuchas Cherroi was first mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed. The pilot's first name, Duchas, was identified in Shadow Fall's sequel, Freed's 2021 novel Victory's Price.",
