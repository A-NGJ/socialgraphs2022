 "content": "Jokol was a male Duros bookie who worked in High Stakes and Hyperspace, a gambling den in business on a hangar deck level of the Wheel space station during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. While at the den, he collected wagers, served drinks, and talked with patrons in a somewhat gruff manner, although he ignored those who were not gambling. He also refused to talk about his homeworld Duro or the Core Worlds. Having done a fair amount of traveling and possessing reasonable piloting skills, Jokol was able to talk knowledgeably about astrogation and hyperlanes.\nJokol was first introduced in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey in 2013 for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. He was an individual who players could potentially meet while searching for information during the first episode of the game.",
