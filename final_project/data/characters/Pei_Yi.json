 "content": "Pei Yi was a female Human dancer, a member of a little-known troupe.\nShe hired rogue pilot Diskret Stahn for passage to the planet Naboo, to meet her colleagues for a prestigious show there. En route, Stahn's ship was damaged in a pirate attack, forcing them to land on Mustafar for repairs and supplies. She missed her performance on Naboo, and was stranded on Mensix Mining Facility with Stahn for a long period of time.\nPei Yi appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
