 "content": "Corpo was a Hutt who lived on the planet of Ord Mantell during the last years of the Galactic Republic.\nA male Hutt, Corpo lived on the planet of Ord Mantell in the last decades of the Galactic Republic. Corpo cared about few things, chiefly gambling and food. His prize possession was a MREM-02 kitchen droid. At some point, the famous chef Slabba Drewl lost a bet to Corpo, and in turn the Hutt had him enslaved. Some time prior to 33 BBY, Jedi Masters Plo Koon and Micah Giiett were dispatched from the Jedi Temple to rescue the chef.\nUpon arrival, Giiett bet Corpo that he would be able to prepare a meal for the Hutt even better than one made by his MREM-02 droid. Corpo was confident in his droid's abilities, and took the wager; if Giett succeeded, Drewl would be freed, but if he failed, he too would be enslaved. Giiett, however, had no intention of failing, and instructed Koon to sabotage MREM-02's dishes. The cook-off began, and the theme ingredient was announced: Denusian squirmers. Though he was attacked by the still-living ingredient, Giiett used his lightsaber to both chop and cook the squirmers. In turn, Koon replaced MREM-02's seebo sauce with droid oil, and managed to slip gundark droppings, Rakririan Burnout Sauce and Bothan foot powder into the droid's pot.\nAt the end of the cook-off, MREM-02 presented Corpo with five complete dishes of well-made food, while Giiett presented two sloppy bowls of squirmer stew. Still confident, Corpo tasted MREM-02's sabotaged meal, only to find it disgusting. Honoring his bet, Corpo immediately released Drewl from his custody. Enraged by his loss, he physically attacked MREM-02, which caused the large droid to topple over onto the Hutt.\nWhile Corpo only appeared in the ambiguously-canon Star Wars Tales, Denusian squirmers and the planet of Denusia were later referenced in, respectively, The Official Star Wars Fact File 128 and The Essential Atlas.",
