 "content": "A humanoid male was the father of the future Sith Lord Sadic. Considered to be low-class within the reconstituted Sith Empire, he and his wife were essentially one step above slaves in Imperial society, though their son demonstrated Force-sensitivity and was taken to the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban for training.\nSadic's father was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Sadic in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. His species, and that of his son, is never specified, nor is his name.",
