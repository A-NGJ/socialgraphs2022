 "content": "Sogan Varga was a Human male technician who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Sogan Varga was present on the planet Dathomir when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Sogan Varga, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nSogan Varga took shelter in Camp Epsilon, the most unsafe camp since it was located in the courtyard of the Imperial Research and Prison Facility, the place where lived the most dangerous undeads. Other survivors in the camp at that time included the former prisoner Zsu Val, the mechanic Nils Cridmeen, the Inquisitor Klex Fulgor, and the stormtroopers GT-643, KD-121 and HX-138.\nLater, a spacer arrived at Camp Epsilon and delivered a radio to Sogan Varga. The radio was provided by the Imperial pilot Jeb Maris in Camp Alpha who had decided to establish communications between the camps. Once radios were delivered to the five camps in the Quarantine Zone, the survivors were able to safely coordinate high altitude supply drops sent from outside the Quarantine Zone.\nMeanwhile, a group of spacers helped the survivors refugees of camp Camp Epsilon to repair a damaged Lambda-class shuttle present in the camp. The survivors and the spacers eventually escaped the Quarantine Zone altogether with the shuttle.\nSogan Varga was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sogan Varga was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
