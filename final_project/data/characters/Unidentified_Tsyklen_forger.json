 "content": "During the Galactic Empire's reign, a Tsyklen female from the planet Tsyk became an expert in the forgery of false identifications. A round, hairless individual with taut skin, she had on each of her hands seven fingers slender enough to be mistaken for tentacles, as well as two opposable thumbs. The Tsyklen's anatomy made her well suited to her profession, with her wide eyes providing excellent vision and her hands allowing her to operate two holo-scribers at once while forging.\nIn 5 BBY, she lived on the planet Nar Hekka within Hutt Space, where she was considered the best identification forger available. The smuggler Han Solo found her by asking around taverns on Nar Hekka, and requested that she forge identifications for him and his partner, Chewbacca. Giving them the false names Garris Kyll and Arrikabukk, respectively, she charged them a large sum of credits for the service.\nThe Tsyklen forger first appeared in the A. C. Crispin novel The Hutt Gambit, released in 1997 as the second part of The Han Solo Trilogy.",
