 "content": "Nell was a male Human smuggler during the reign of the Galactic Empire.\nA scrawny Human male, Nell was a smuggler active during the Galactic Civil War. During his career, Nell became indebted to Giarda of the Jiramma kajidic. While on Nar Shaddaa, Nell partnered with the Gank bounty hunter Gorran on a job to recover a Sakiyan informant and pay off his debts to Giarda, by collecting a bounty placed by the Gorensla clan. When both Gorran and Nell were stopped in the streets by Giarda and her guards, the Hutt manipulated the pair into working for her, allowing Gorran and Nell to proposed turning over Razall over to her in exchange for a clean slate for their debt. When the pair successfully captured Razall, Giarda followed through on her promise of forgiving their debts, privately gloating on her accomplishment of twisting them back into her service.",
