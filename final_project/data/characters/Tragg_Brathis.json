 "content": "Tragg Brathis was a Moff who was the alleged leader of the Grand Imperial Union.\nThe only known appearance of Brathis was during a pirate HoloNet transmission over Channel 81 during the Black Fleet Crisis. In the transmission, Brathis displayed his Imperial fleet and announced his coalition's support of the Dushkan League.\nThe broadcast dismayed some New Republic leaders, fearing that the forces of Nil Spaar were stronger than anticipated, but the existence of Brathis and his Union were never substantiated.",
