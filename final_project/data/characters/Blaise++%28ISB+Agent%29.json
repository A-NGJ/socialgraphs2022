 "content": "Blaise was an Imperial Security Bureau agent and interrogator active during the height of the Galactic Civil War. He had a reputation of being very ruthless in his interrogations.\nAt some point during the Galactic Civil War, Blaise and his forces proceeded to infiltrate Cloud City on Bespin, knowing that Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian was secretly aiding the Rebel Alliance, and was trying to rout out Rebel spies in the area.\nHe was as much of a dangerously cunning warrior as he was a brutal interrogator. He also tended to note his enemies' attack patterns. Even though he was a member of the ISB instead of the Stormtrooper Corps, he nonetheless wore a variation of scout trooper armor that had a slight blue tint to it.\nBlaise is a character that was introduced in one of the Villain Packs of the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Imperial Assault.",
