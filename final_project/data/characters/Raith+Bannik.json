 "content": "Raith Bannik was a Human male thief who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. He tasked a Republic spacer to rescue his loved ones from the offworld pirates who have kidnapped them. To the dismay of the spacer and his friend Tonn, Bannik's \"loved ones\" were just a bunch of toy droids.\nRaith Bannik is a non-player character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game. Republic players can interact with him to receive the \"Penalty for Theft\" mission.\nThe player can give Bannik back his \"loved ones\" and earn light side points, or smash them in front of his face, earning dark side points.",
