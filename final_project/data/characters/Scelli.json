 "content": "Scelli was a female Meri who worked as a speeder driver in the city Tekar on the planet Derilyn. During the Galactic Civil War, a group of Rebel Alliance agents hailed Scelli to transport them to Scelli's Arena of Games, and she agreed to drive them to the stadium. However, for the duration of the journey she refused to converse with her passengers, because she feared that she was being spied upon by listening devices installed by the Galactic Empire.",
