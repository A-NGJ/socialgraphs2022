One of the other teams was made up of \"Duckonians,\" a made-up species that the Togorian Mebara Jos and other members of the Fireclaw Horde had disguised themselves as. Di'hal'uma discovered the Duckonians' secret, so she arranged a meeting with Seng Windrunner, the leader of the Talons, to report this to him.
