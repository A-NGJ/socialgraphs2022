 "content": "Gouge was the nickname of a Chagrian male criminal who was incarcerated in Belsavis prison, a Galactic Republic prison facility on the planet Belsavis. During the invasion of Belsavis by the Sith Empire, Guard Lieutenant Brok and three members of the disgraced Dagger Wing—Ty, Symo, and Lin—located and captured Gouge, preventing him from escaping like other prisoners. They were pinned down until they were rescued by Havoc Squad, which helped them evacuate the prisoner to a more secure location.\nGouge appears in the Trooper class mission \"Overwhelming Force\" on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011. Players can kill Gouge for dark side alignment points.",
