 "content": "Havina Vonreg was a human female pilot of the Galactic Empire and a member of the Vonreg family, an aristocratic family. Vonreg served in Titan Squadron tasked with hunting down the New Republic's Project Starhawk.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Havina Vonreg's brothers were killed by a rebel attack. She was present during the Battle of Endor, which saw the death of Emperor Palpatine and left half of her trusted squadmates dead. She had seen friends defect to the Rebellion and betray the Empire. She was aware of the defectors, Inferno Squad Commander Iden Versio, Yrica Quell, and especially Commander Lindon Javes whom her squadron chased. Following Endor, Vonreg served in Titan Squadron under Varko Grey. She shared her last name with First Order pilot Elrik Vonreg.\nVonreg was a human female with black hair, blue eyes, and light skin. As an Imperial TIE pilot, she wore a standard issue TIE fighter pilot uniform, and a black helmet with a red skull painted on the front. Vonreg was generally a brash and cold woman whose only goal was to destroy the New Republic.\nHavina Vonreg first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Squadrons, where she was portrayed by Helen Sadler.",
