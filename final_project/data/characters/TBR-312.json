 "content": "TBR-312 was the designation of a clone stormtrooper who was bred to serve the Galactic Empire. During the First Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, he was stationed on Belazura. When Luke Skywalker, disguised as a technician, tried to get into the back of a factory, TBR-312 and his partner stopped him to ask for his access codes. When Skywalker refused to show them, TBR-312 informed the staff, whereupon Skywalker killed him with his lightsaber.",
