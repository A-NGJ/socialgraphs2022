 "content": "Vareesa Enan was a na√Øve Ithorian tourist who traveled to Ralltiir in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Vareesa was the cousin of Vanster Enan, who ran a sop house on Cularin. On Ralltiir, Vareesa was befriended by fellow Ithorian Kikow and the Wookiee Furellas, though both apparently had ulterior motives. Furellas bought a Ralltiir tiger kitten for Vareesa and helped smuggle him offworld. Vareesa named the kitten \"Little Kikow\", unaware that he would grow up to be bloodthirsty and unmanageable.",
