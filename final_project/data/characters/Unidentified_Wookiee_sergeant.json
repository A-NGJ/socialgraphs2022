 "content": "A male Wookiee who had reached the rank of sergeant worked as the operator for a Holoscanner at the conference on Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars. The scanner was used to check each Wookiee entering the conference was not carrying any weapons, a task supervised by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was in charge of the conference's security.\nWhilst scanning the sergeant alerted Obi-Wan to the Wookiee Chewbacca, who the scanner showed was carrying a metallic object. Obi-Wan confronted Chewbacca, but Jedi Grand Master Yoda, who was also present, pointed out the object was a harmless toy. The sergeant then informed Obi-Wan that general Attimun, a Wookiee war hero, had arrived. The Jedi told Attimun that he needn't be scanned due to his status, however Attimun insisted all must be treated equally and so the sergeant scanned him which showed he was clean. Attimun had in fact smuggled a dismantled explosive charge launcher in and later attacked the conference speakers.\nThe Wookiee sergeant first appeared in the comic Incident on Kashyyyk written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Tanya Roberts and published in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.37 in 2012.",
