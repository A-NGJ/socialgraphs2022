 "content": "Binalu was an elderly Human female who served for many years as one of the \"twin rulers\" of Typha-Dor, alongside Talus, in the years leading up to the Clone Wars.\nIn 25 BBY, during the Separatist Crisis, Binalu supported the Galactic Senate of the Republic and fought against an imminent invasion of her world by the fleet of Vanqor, a neighboring planet in the Uziel system.\nAs leader of the Typha-Dor High Council, Binalu petitioned the Senate that it rush Jedi diplomats to her planet's aid and was intimately involved in the high-security and strategic planning meetings preparatory to Vanqor's imminent attempt to invade. She approved a preemptive countermeasure, based on secret intelligence, to trap the Vanqor fleet in a satellite-moon corridor through which the enemy made its approach.\nBinalu worked not only with High General Bycha and her lesser generals, but also with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Clee Rhara, Siri Tachi, and the other Jedi envoys sent at the behest of the Senate, to negotiate a ceasefire and an enduring peace between Typha-Dor and Vanqor's ruler, Van-Ith.",
