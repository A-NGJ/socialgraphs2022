 "content": "Fenix was a Besalisk information broker who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Fenix lived on the planet Druckenwell and established a network of contacts, who helped him to find out about everything that went on there. The main place he hanged out was Botcha's, a bar in the planet's factory district. One time while he was there with a Gran and a Rodian, he was approached by the Heroes of Cularin, who asked him for information on the location of the stolen freighter First Light.",
