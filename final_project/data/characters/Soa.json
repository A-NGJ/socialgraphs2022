 "content": "Soa, also known as The Infernal One, was an extremely powerful Force-sensitive male Rakata who had been imprisoned in the Eternity Vault on Belsavis for nearly twenty thousand years prior to the Galactic War. During a bombing run by the Imperial military, the section of prison in which Soa was imprisoned was discovered.\nA massive Rakata male, Soa rose to power as a warlord in the Infinite Empire of its species well before the Empire's collapse. Legends later claimed that Soa, leading an army that included his creations, the Annihilation Droid XRR-3 and the alchemical monster Gharj, conquered a thousand planets in his time, and he earned the title \"Infernal One.\" Among those worlds was the planet Korriban, whose native Sith he ruled. Sometime after the Sith King Adas's uprising against the Rakata, Soa and his Infernal Council of traitorous Sith were imprisoned with their army in the Eternity Vault on the planet Belsavis; legends said that it took an army of Rakata and other ancient species to stop him.\nMillennia later, conflict between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War unintentionally caused Soa to reawaken. Both sides, somewhat aware of what they had awakened, sent a strike team to eliminate Soa before he regained enough power to become a threat to the entire galaxy. It is unknown which team accomplished their task. The strike team faced Soa's creations and allies, and eventually made their way to his imprisonment chamber. When they arrived, he finally broke free from his restraints and fought them, taunting them and claiming that he could not be defeated. The strike team, however, proved him wrong and finally brought an end to the Infernal One after 20,000 years.\nSoa had an ego to match his great size and power. He was arrogant and was shown to be extremely proud of his ancient accomplishments to the point where he would brag about them outright. When he faced the strike team sent to stop him he refused to even consider the possibility of defeat and instead proceeded to insult and belittle his enemies.\nSoa was a powerful user of the Force. He utilized a suite of combat abilities to both protect himself from assaults and to attack opponents. These abilities included Ball Lightning, hurling opponents into Mind Traps, and extensive telekinetic abilities that allowed him to send opponents on lengthy airborne paths and to destabilize and manipulate large platforms. He could also summon an extremely powerful Force barrier that was only overcome by dropping heavy pillars onto his frame.\nHe also appears to have been gifted at alchemy, claiming to have created an army of slaves and the monster Gharj. Additionally he was a skilled manipulator of Rakatan Force-based technologies, having developed the Annihilation Droid XRR-3.\nSoa appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, as the target of the Eternity Vault Operation. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.",
