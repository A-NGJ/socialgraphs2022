Following the arrival of the Galactic Empire on Draenell's Point, Benthar's Boys harassed the local Imperial garrison and got involved in a turf war with a the Vibroblade gang. Droxie left him for the leader of the Vibroblades, Herafin, and during a fight between the gangs Benthar was captured. He was eventually freed by Alliance to Restore the Republic operatives working with Benthar's Boys.\nThe operatives convinced both the Benthar's Boys and Vibroblades to unite and form a resistance cell to oppose the Imperial presence on the world.",
