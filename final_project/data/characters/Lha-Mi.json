 "content": "Lha-Mi was a Talid Dai Bendu monk and a Je'daii Temple Master serving the Je'daii Order on Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire's reign.\nA Force-sensitive Talid, Lha-Mi was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order and the Order of Dai Bendu on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Lha-Mi's skill with a sword were legendary when he was appointed as a Je'daii Temple Master, the highest ranking members of the Order. Lha-Mi governed the Great Temple of Martial Arts, Stav Kesh. Assisted in his duties by Je'daii Master Tave, Lha-Mi and the other Temple Masters formed the Masters' Council, meeting via holocommunication at the Temple of Balance, Akar Kesh.\nWhen Je'daii Journeyers Dalien and Lanoree Brock were studying at Stav Kesh during their Great Journey circa 25,802 BBY, the siblings were called before the Temple Master after they were both injured during a training session with Master Kin'ade and her Darrow Sphere. Dalien's impatience with his limited Force ability led to both his own injury and his sisters, forcing Kin'ade to intervene. Listening to their account of the situation, Lha-Mi dismisses Kin'ade and the younger Brock, while asking Lanoree to stay behind for further discussion on her future and how Dalien's path was his own to tread. At the end of the Brock siblings' time at Stav Kesh, Lha-Mi oversaw a controlled fight in the Great Hall alongside Masters Kin'ade and Tave. The Brocks, two Cathar twins, a Wookiee, and a Twi'lek demonstrate their skills to the Masters one last time, with Tave and Kin'ade softening their blows through the Force to avoid injuries. When the fighting concludes, Lha-Mi summons Lanoree Brock to his spartan chambers for one final meetings before she departs in the morning. The Temple Master shows Brock a hexagonal chamber adorned only with framed pictures on the walls, dozens of beings from across the system that Lha-Mi has failed. He explains to her that he keeps this room open for all to visit as a symbol that no one among the Je'daii is perfect, not even a Temple Master.\nDuring the Stargazer Uprising, Lha-Mi arranged a meeting with Je'daii Ranger Lanoree Brock aboard his Peacemaker-class cruiser in a remote field thirty kilometers south of Akar Kesh. Attended by Masters Dam-Powl, Tem Madog, Xiang, a Wookiee, and one other, Lha-Mi had arranged the secretive meeting to discuss the growing problem of Dalien Brock's Stargazer cult. Chosen because of her involvement in the Hang Layden accords on Kalimahr, a successful mission to Nox, and her elimination of the leader of Wookiee dissidents on Ska Gora, Gharcanna; but also because of the fact that Dalien and Lanoree were siblings, Ranger Brock was given a briefing on the threat he posed to the Order. Brock and his cult desired to leave the Tython system and planned to do so by activating a hypergate rumored to be located deep within the heart of the Old City far out in the Red Desert on the continent of Talss. While Lha-Mi vehemently denied the existence of the hypergate, going as far as to seal the cabin of his starship using the Force when mention of it arose, he insisted that the true threat to Tython was the method in which Brock planned to open the gate. A device using the ancient technology of the Gree to create dark matter was theorized by the Je'daii to rip open a black hole if activated on Tython, and potentially destroy the entire system. Hoping to avoid panic by sending a larger group to find and detain Brock or worse, lead more people to support his cause, the Masters agreed a single Ranger would make for a better outcome.\nA wise and old being by the time he was Temple Master of Stav Kesh, Lha-Mi was a legendary warrior of great renown on Tython. Carrying a similarly fabled sword, Lha-Mi was possessed of a kind and gentle demeanor that belied his deadly skills. Humble and balanced in the Force, Lha-Mi kept a public room at Stav Kesh filled with the photos of beings he had let down, a symbol of the imperfection of all Je'daii.",
