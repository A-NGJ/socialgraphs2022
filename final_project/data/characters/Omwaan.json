 "content": "Omwaan was an Ithorian who resided on Kashyyyk sometime after 0 BBY.\nOmwaan was a novice adventurer who would often teach spacers the language of Shyriiwook. Omwaan also lost his right arm some time in the past, and had it replaced with a blue cybernetic prosthesis. It is not known how he lost his arm, though he could have easily lost it on a dangerous adventure. Sometime after 0 BBY, Omwaan decided to leave Kachirho, and was superseded by Chewbacca, who gave spacers adventuring advice in his stead.\nOmwaan was a non-player character in the\nMMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, Omwaan stood in the city of Kachirho, and would teach players the language of Shyriiwook. However, after the New-Game Enhancement of 2005, Omwaan was removed from the game, and replaced with Chewbacca.",
