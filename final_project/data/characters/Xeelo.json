 "content": "Xeelo, also known as Twitcher, was a Rodian who operated a starship during the time of the Clone Wars. Following the Cularin system's succession from the Galactic Republic, military patrols were increased in the system, and on one occasion, Xeelo and a number of other spacers queued in their starships near to the planet Cularin, waiting for permission to depart from the world.\nXeelo believed that conditions in the Cularin system were better during the period of time that the system was under Republic martial law than when the system became independent.",
