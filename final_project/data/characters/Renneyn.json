 "content": "Renneyn was a Clawdite from Zolan in the Zolan system. In 2 BBY, Renneyn discovered that he had developed Zithrom's Disease, which was a kidney disorder that usually affected elderly Human males. Unable to get any Clondex, which postponed the disease, he eventually died in 1 ABY, three years after his initial diagnosis.",
