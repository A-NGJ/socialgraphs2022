 "content": "Cygnus Anton was an avian individual who held the role of Chief Regional Auditor in the Galactic Empire. Anton also came to be associated with the resurgent Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate. Accompanied by stormtroopers and Crimson Dawn guards, Anton visited the planet Calior, where they declared that the local southern water works was now Imperial property and demanded for a monthly tribute of five thousand credits if the residents wished to have continued access. Though Anton themself remained aboard one of two nearby All Terrain Scout Transports, they projected a hologram to appear as if they were present on the surface. Anton and their guards were attacked, however, by a group known as the Revengers, who made a living of pursuing Crimson Dawn after it had destroyed their homes. After the guards and troopers had been defeated, Anton revealed they had been a hologram. As the walkers fired upon the Revengers, however, the other was downed by the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon and a group of Assassins Guild operatives who were serving the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Realizing that Vader was attacking them, Anton attempted to protest, but the Sith Lord destroyed their walker in his TIE Advanced.",
