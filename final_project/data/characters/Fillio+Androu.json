 "content": "Fillio Androu was a Wroonian smuggler and the partner of Linx Mallicker.\nTogether with another Wroonian gunrunner, Linx Mallicker, Finious Androu bought the CEC YT-2400 light freighter Lambarian Crab, previously used by smuggler Finious Crab. The Wroonians discovered two of the three secret smuggling compartments that Crab had used.\nThey then began dealing with illegal weapons from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, avoiding the Corellian system because Crab had earned himself some enemies in the local law enforcement agencies and they would recognize the ship. The Wroonians sold their cargo to Imperial officers that liked illegal firearms and to some cells of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.",
