 "content": "Dabrin was a Human male admiral of the Republic Navy during the Cold War and Galactic War against the Sith Empire. Dabrin was the commander of the Valor-class cruiser Valiant, and his extensive knowledge of the Republic Military made him a target when the Dark Jedi Warren Sedoru seized the Valiant and took him captive and interrogated on Republic fleet codes. Dabrin was freed by the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython, who defeated Sedoru. Dabrin insisted that Sedoru be executed before he could give them to the Empire but the Jedi refused, insisting that Sedoru can be redeemed. As Sedoru mocked the Hero for their compassion, Dabrin knocked him out, agreeing to keep him sedated until the Jedi could come and collect him.\nAfter the Hero defeated the Sith Emperor, Dabrin personally rewarded the Hero and company with the Cross of Glory.",
