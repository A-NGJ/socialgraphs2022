 "content": "Moorsey was a male Human, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nMoorsey originally worked as a mechanic on Cularin, in the platform city Lissken. However, his arm was crushed by faulty lifting equipment, so his employers gave him a prosthetic arm and paid him off, to avoid a lawsuit. Moorsey invested the money in the bar Spanner's, in the city of Hedrett and started working there as a bartender. He was present when the heroes of Cularin visited Spanner's in about 31 BBY.",
