 "content": "Eriann Strathmore was an arrogant Lady and model Imperial citizen. She detested the weak and had a particular dislike of inferior alien races.\nLady Strathmore believed that her only vice was her penchant for gambling. She only frequented the more distinguished establishments in the galaxy such as the Ace of Sabres where she tried to get membership into the exclusive Sabre Club.\nEriann Strathmore was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.",
