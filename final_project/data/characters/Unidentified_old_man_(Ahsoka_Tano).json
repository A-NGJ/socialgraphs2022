 "content": "A human old man lived in a farm village during the Imperial Era. He held a supervisory role for the farmers there, doling out water for anyone who needed it and announcing when breaks and mealtimes occurred. Unlike one of his workers, he was critical of the Galactic Empire, believing it to be built on tyranny and oppression. The old man was one of four survivors of the village after it was attacked by an Imperial Inquisitor in search of Great Jedi Purge survivor Ahsoka Tano, who had been working in the village under the alias \"Ashla\". Tano defeated the Inquisitor, and the old man and the two other survivors, a brother and sister, were taken to safety by Senator Bail Organa.",
