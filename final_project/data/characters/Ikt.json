 "content": "Ikt was a Mustafarian who explored the ruins of Mustafar.\nDuring his exploration of some old ruins, he found a strange piece of crystal that appeared to have a snake-shaped flaw within it. He spent the night camped among the ruins, though was awoken by someone running away from him. He noticed that the crystal he found was gone.\nIkt visited the Mensix Mining Facility and found a spacer willing to hunt down his thief.\nIkt appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
