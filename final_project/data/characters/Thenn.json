 "content": "Thenn was a blond-haired human female who served in the military of the Galactic Empire. Possessing the rank of captain at the time of the Iron Blockade, she was stationed within the cordoned off Anoat sector, operating on worlds such as Burnin Konn and Bespin.\nAmidst the unrest taking place in the sector, Thenn approached a talented local scoundrel to solicit aid in carrying out off-the-record business on the captain's behalf. Offering to overlook the part-time mercenary's crimes, Captain Thenn hired the scoundrel for jobs including conducting a retaliatory strike on Cloud City gangsters responsible for killing an Imperial agent, and clearing illegal would-be scavengers from an Imperial crash site on Hoth. She offered Imperial equipment as compensation for these tasks.\nCaptain Thenn first appeared in Star Wars canon in the multiplayer mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, created by the Kabam company and released on September 10, 2015 for iOS and Android platforms. She acts as a quest giver, offering rare \"Imperial Opportunity\" missions for the player to complete.",
