 "content": "A legendary hero of the S'kytri people, Hormaket the Vanquisher was the leader of the S'kytri in their war against the ground dwellers who threatened the equilibrium of the world.\nOn the primordial world of Skye, the planet's surface was covered in cataclysmic events encouraged by mutant blorgworms, five-headed gogitols, blood-sucking beasts. The firmament above remained free of these monstrosities and from the interactions of the Great Wind with the towering Canaitith Mountain, the S'kytri were created. Descending down upon the world, the S'kytri, under the leadership of Hormaket the Vanquisher, dispatched the ground-dwelling evils and imprisoned them for eternity in the Entyrmion.",
