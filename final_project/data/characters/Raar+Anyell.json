 "content": "Raar Anyell was a Human male Corellian TIE/LN starfighter pilot in the Imperial Navy that served as part of Alpha Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Villian Dance, that was assigned to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Steel Talon.\nAnyell was a foul-up everywhere but in the cockpit, and although he was always behind on keeping up with new intel, he was a good enough pilot for his squadron leader to give him some slack.\nHe was one of twelve pilots of Alpha Squadron assigned to chase down RLH-1, a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, but was instructed to hold back while the squadron leader attempted to convince the shuttle's pilot to surrender. Anyell witnessed the shuttle destroyed by his commander after the pilot refused to return. He was one of two pilots assigned to examine the wreckage for survivors, of which there were none.",
