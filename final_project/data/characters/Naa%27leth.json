 "content": "Naa'leth was a Dathomirian female. She was a member of the Nightsisters during the Clone Wars. She and her sister Karis aided Asajj Ventress in the attempt to assassinate Count Dooku on Serenno, which failed. She would die during the Battle of Dathomir.\nNaa'leth was a member of Mother Talzin's clan of Nightsisters on Dathomir. She, alongside her sister Karis, were among the Hunters and were regarded as the clan's greatest warriors.\nNaa'leth was part of a group of Nightsisters who attempted to attack Asajj Ventress when she arrived on Dathomir, unaware that she was once one of them. After learning that Ventress was a sister, Naa'leth and Karis were assigned to her to travel to Serenno in order to assassinate Ventress' former master, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Count Dooku. The trio arrived in the forest outside Castle Serenno, sneaking into Dooku's chamber, but the Count awoke, and fought them in a lightsaber battle. Naa'leth wielded a green lightsaber as the three invisible assassins tried to take down the Sith Lord.\nDespite Ventress gaining the apparent upper hand, Dooku quickly claimed victory, blasting all three Nightsisters out the window with his Force lightning. The trio returned to Dathomir unsuccessful, but Talzin saw victory in their defeat, deducing Dooku would now seek a new apprentice as his protector for further attempts on his life.\nAfter Talzin contacted the count on Serenno, Dooku revealed that he was willing to take on a new apprentice from their planet. The Nightsisters selected a Nightbrother named Savage Opress, and after using Nightsister magick to enhance him, brought him to his new master. Naa'leth accompanied Mother Talzin to Serenno to deliver Opress to Dooku. After Dooku received Opress, Naa'leth and her sisters returned to Dathomir.\nWanting the Nightsisters exterminated for good, Dooku sent General Grievous and the Droid Army to Dathomir to destroy the clan. Naa'leth fought in the battle, but was killed, with Ventress and Talzin being left the only survivors.\nNaa'leth first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Nightsisters.\" She was voiced by Cara Pifko, who voiced numerous other characters in the series.",
