 "content": "Tarron Neb was a member of a species that hailed from the mountainous moon Yavin 8, located within the Yavin system. When Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire became disgusted by the Yavin 8 natives, he ordered their destruction. His will was executed, and although the species was largely wiped out, Neb escaped the purge, leaving him as its sole survivor. For armament, Neb carried a sword and wore a form of armor.\nTarron Neb was created by Stephen Baker, a 16-year-old Star Wars fan who participated in Star Wars Galaxy's \"Design An Alien\" competition, which was initiated in the third issue in 1995. When the winning entries were published in the seventh issue in 1996, Baker's entry was placed under the \"honorable mentions\" section of the \"under 16\" subdivision. Although the entry was published as \"Tarron,\" Baker's original artwork features the spelling of \"Torron.\" Star Wars continuity editor Leland Chee later stated that successfully published \"Design an Alien\" material was considered canon.",
