While travelling from the settlement of New Meen to the city of Nabat, B'ura B'an was attacked by a gang of thugs in the employ of Teemo the Hutt. During the fighting, B'ura B'an lost one of his lekku to the Trandoshan bounty hunter Trex, who subsequently imprisoned B'ura B'an aboard his YT-1300 freighter, the Krayt Fang. B'ura B'an was later released and returned to his homeworld by a group of adventurers.",
