 "content": "The sister of Tarrin Datch was a Human female, one of several children born to her parents, though she was the only girl. She, along with her siblings, assisted her parents in performing flight shows for pilots waiting for their freighters to be serviced at the family owned Pellezara station. After Tarrin left to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 1 BBY, he knew better than to involve the rest of his family in the turmoil of the Galactic Civil War.",
