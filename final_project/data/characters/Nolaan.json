 "content": "Nolaan was an Imperial captain who served aboard the Interrogator under the command of High Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne.\nEarlier in his life, Nolaan was assigned to the Outer Rim Territories as a junior officer. This would later help bring Jovan Vharing to his attention who he took an instant liking to and was openly biased toward.\nNolaan became friend and mentor to Vharing and pulled some strings so that the then lieutenant was brought aboard the Interrogator. Within a year of this, Nolaan was executed on the ship's bridge by Tremayne and succeeded by his protégé.",
