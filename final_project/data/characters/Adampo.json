 "content": "Adampo was a Yarkora male Jedi Master of the Jedi Order and a member of the Jedi High Council during the High Republic Era. He possessed blond hair and long white whiskers that dangled from his chin, which he occasionally stroked while speaking. When the Council convened to discuss the Jedi Order's involvement in Galactic Republic action against the Nihil, Adampo was present via hologram. Adampo opposed the idea of military action, insisting that the Jedi were not a military force. Master Oppo Rancisis countered his point, stating that the Jedi had been a military force in the past, winning the Great Sith War. Ultimately, the vote was left with a tie after ten of the eleven Masters present had voted, and the decision was left up to Jora Malli, who chose to involve the Jedi in the Republic Defense Coalition effort.\nAdampo first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi. Initial versions of the novel stated that the Jedi Master was female. However, after The High Republic: Into the Dark depicted Adampo as male, e-book editions of Light of the Jedi were updated with the character's correct gender.",
