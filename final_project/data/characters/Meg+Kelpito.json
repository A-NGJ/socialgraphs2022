 "content": "Meg Kelpito was a male Quarren criminal, who operated out of Providence during the Galactic Civil War.\nKelpito was the hangar chief of the pirate lair of Providence during the Galactic Civil War. He was also representative of the Quarren population. Colonel Viyenah of Imperial Intelligence suspected him to have been one of Seggor Tels' followers.\nKelpito was enigmatic and silent, immersed in melancholy. He was always composed and slow and rarely made decisions but, when he decided something, it was always a wise decision. Like all the Quarrens who resided in Providence, he didn't mix with the rest of the population.\nMeg Kelpito was created by Jean-Michel Ringuet for the ambiguously canon roleplaying aid \"Providence,\" which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 1.",
