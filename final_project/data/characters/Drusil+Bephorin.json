 "content": "Drusil Bephorin was a brilliant Givin female cryptologist.\nFor a time, Bephorin worked for the Galactic Empire, which had captured her family, against her will. She was later rescued by Luke Skywalker and Nakari Kelen in a mission spearheaded by the Rebel Alliance and agreed to work for them.\nLike other members of her race, she enjoyed solving complex mathematical problems, but she was particularly skilled in areas of probability analysis and cryptography. Skywalker, in his discussions with her, often found that her keen insights gave him a new perspective on matters. She displayed a great affection for her family and frequently during her time with Skywalker and Kelen urged that every effort be made to verify that the mission to rescue her family had succeeded.",
