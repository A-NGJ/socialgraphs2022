 "content": "Tham's partner was a male Human who worked as a scavenger for a living. In 138 ABY, Tham and his partner brought their recent haul to Ania Solo's junkyard. Tham's partner asked for ten thousand credits in exchange for their shipment but Solo stood firm in her offer of two hundred. Tham and his partner then threatened to take whatever valuables Solo had in her junkyard but were surprised from behind by SD, Solo's droid. In the end, Tham and his partner were escorted back to their ship and forced to leave their shipment behind without receiving any payment.",
