 "content": "Daetan Taakses was a male Rodian who lived on the moon of Pinett with his nephew, Oryel Taakses, during the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the rival trading concerns the Corsignis Property Alliance and the Jon-Tow Economic Development Group blockaded Pinett as a result of a dispute, Taakses became the leader of the Pinett Freedom Force, a protest group that campaigned against the blockade. The Freedom Force attempted to prevent Corsignis and Jon-Tow from landing on Pinett and Taakses went on a hunger strike, as an act of protest. However, a group of port workers became disgruntled as a result of the Freedom Force's actions and they attempted to kill Taakses.",
