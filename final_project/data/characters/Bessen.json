 "content": "Bessen was a Human male born around 26 ABY. He was a trooper in Galactic Alliance Security, and in 43 ABY, he took part in the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, who had been charged with dereliction of duty. During the arrest, Bessen inadvertently shot at Skywalker with his blaster. The bolt missed, and the situation was quickly brought back under control. Bessen's captain, Savar, punished Bessen for firing on the prisoner by making him run back to the Security blockhouse on foot, while Savar transported Skywalker there via speeder.\nBessen was a Human male born around 26 ABY, during the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War. He later became a trooper in Galactic Alliance Security, a security force located on the galactic capital of Coruscant. There, he served under the command of Security Captain Savar. In 43.5 ABY, Bessen took part in the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, who had been indicted with failing to prevent former Jedi Knight Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force. The Security troopers were joined by three bounty hunters hired by the Galactic Federation of Free Alliancesâ€”Skakoan politician Hrym Mawarr, Human bounty hunter Zilaash Kuh, and Quarren inventor Dhidal Nyz.\nDuring the arrest, ex-smuggler Han Solo, who was accompanying Skywalker at the time, insulted Savar, causing the captain to stiffen. Nyz assumed that Skywalker was attempting to use the Force on the captain, and he exclaimed that the prisoner was resisting. Surprised by the sudden commotion, Bessen lost his nerve and involuntarily fired off a shot at the Jedi from his blaster. Skywalker dodged the bolt, and Jedi Master Kam Solusar, who had also been accompanying Skywalker at the time of his arrest, deflected the shot aside with his lightsaber. Solo abruptly shot Bessen's gun out of his hand, destroying it before he could fire it again. As the situation was brought back under control, Savar punished Bessen for firing on the prisoner and ordered Carn, a sergeant, to watch him do 200 push-ups and then run back to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse on foot. Meanwhile, Savar and the other Security troopers took Skywalker back to the blockhouse in the captain's personnel carrier speeder.\nDue to his inexperience in the field, Bessen was slightly anxious and easily startled, resulting in his reflexive shot at Skywalker. He was also proved to be passive and compliant following this mistake, accepting punishment from his superior officer without complaint.\nBessen appears briefly as a minor character in the first novel in the Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Outcast, by Aaron Allston.",
