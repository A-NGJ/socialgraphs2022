 "content": "Jezzi was a human female who, alongside Femmi, brought supper and medicine to the Andor household on the planet Ferrix for the elderly human Maarva Andor one night in 5 BBY. Jezzi later returned to the residence. The next day, Maarva's adopted son Cassian Andor, who had been out of the house when Jezzi visited, questioned the family droid B2EMO as to who had visited while he was out. B2EMO mentioned Jezzi and Femmi's visit and began to explain why Jezzi had returned, but Cassian cut him off and asked specifically if anyone had come looking for him. Jezzi, along with Sammo, was one of the few individuals aware that Cassian was born on Kenari rather than Ferrix as Maarva claimed that they were family.\nJezzi was mentioned in the first episode of the television series Andor, which aired on September 21, 2022. She first appeared in \"One Way Out\", portrayed by Pamela Nomvete.",
