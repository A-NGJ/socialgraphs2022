 "content": "Jesba-Be Issa was an Aki-Aki resident of the planet Pasaana who acted as a tribal guardian of communally raised children. By 35 ABY, Issa was an adult and attended the Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley. When a group of Resistance agents arrived at the festival searching for a Sith wayfinder, they passed directly by Issa as the guardian danced among a large group of other Aki-Aki.\nThe tribal guardian then stopped dancing and stood with fellow guardian Fadda-Rarb Arda by some of the festival's tents while holding an Aki-Aki infant. As Issa held up the infant and rocked it in the air, the Resistance agents passed by once again. Issa wore a turquoise flowing kaftan that allowed for unimpeded dancing with a monocot-fiber hood suitable for a warm sun. The Aki-Aki also wore a rattling purple pallie-pit necklace and a second blue necklace with golden beads. Issa had gray skin and brown eyes.\nJesba-Be Issa was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
