In the quest The Smiting of Old Scratch, the Wookiee Harwakokok asks the player to kill Scratch to earn his trust.\nThe creature appeared again in the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game scenario Minstyngar Hunt that was available in March and April 2010. In this scenario, the player is asked by the Wookiee Krepauk to kill the creature and bring him Scratch's head. It is unknown which version of Scratch's death is the canonical version.",
