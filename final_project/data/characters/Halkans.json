 "content": "Halkans was a Human male minister and carbonite smelter active in the Empress Teta system in the years prior to the Great Sith War. In 3997 BBY, a dark side-using secret society known as the Krath overthrew the Tetan Monarchy, and took control of the system. Halkans refused the Krath's demands, and was beheaded. His disembodied head was later served on a platter during a celebratory dinner at the Iron Citadel. During the dinner, his head was stolen by a Krath kitten.\nHalkans was a male Human minister and carbonite smelter who worked in the Empress Teta system in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. In 3997 BBY, the Krath, a dark side-practicing secret society, overthrew the Tetan Monarchy. After Halkans refused the Krath's demands, he became the last of the old regime to be executed. Halkans was beheaded, and his severed head was served to the Krath on a silver platter during a celebratory dinner at the Iron Citadel, the Krath headquarters. Halkan's head was quickly snatched away by a Krath kitten, who had to defend its prize from another Krath kitten.\nHalkans was loyal to the old Tetan leadership, and refused to bend to the will of the usurping Krath. However, his loyalty would be the cause of his death.\nHalkans' first and only appearance came in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith, a story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released over late 1994-early 1995. He only appeared in the arc's first issue, appearing only as a severed head. In this appearance, Halkans was illustrated by Chris Gossett.",
