 "content": "Harlech was the captain of the Drogheda Royal Guard on the planet Drogheda. He was the closest confidant of Queen Sarna, and led her forces against the Drogheda Revolutionaries in the Drogheda Civil War. He was present for the conclusion of the war at the Drogheda Citadel, when Lando Calrissian attempted to take Sarna hostage. However, Harlech decided to attempt a coup, ordering his men to kill both Lando and his Queen. Before the action could take place, the revolutionaries stormed the palace, telling Harlech to stand down. Although the rest of his men had already surrendered, Harlech decided to go down fighting. However, as he brandished his blaster, he was cut down by a stun blast, depriving him of a heroic last stand.",
