 "content": "Sal Sor'Chan was a Force-sensitive Nautolan female who served as an advisor and recruiter for the Rebel Alliance.\nSal Sor'Chan believed the Empire was evil and tyrannical, but thought the majority of its people were simply ignorant to its evil. As a recruiting agent for the Rebellion, she worked to see the Empire defeated by showing its citizenry the error of their ways. Sor'Chan firmly believed mercy was a source of strength and would rather spare the life of an enemy than kill.\nLike all Nautolans, Sor'Chan was amphibious and could breathe both under water and on land. She wore armored clothing and carried a blaster pistol, shock gloves, datapad, comlink and disguise kit. She had a tattoo of the Rebel crest hidden somewhere on her body.\nZora appears as an introductory character for Fantasy Flight Games' Force and Destiny roleplaying game Beta.",
