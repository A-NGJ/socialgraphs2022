 "content": "This Neimoidian was a historic military commander.\nThis officer was known to wear a giant hat and rode a kaadu during a campaign.\nHe was a significant person in Neimoidian society and was granted a heroic portrait. This artwork came to hang in a gallery within Senator Lott Dod's palace on Cato Neimoidia.\nThis character was described as a \"Napoleonic Neimoidian\" in the episode guide. This is in reference to Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, whom the Neimoidien resembles. The painting itself is a reference to the classical portrait Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David.",
