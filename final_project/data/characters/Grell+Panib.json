 "content": "Grell Panib was a Bakuran male who served as General of the Bakuran Defense Fleet during the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nGrell Panib was born in a mining colony on Heffrin circa 19 BBY. He was a tumultuous youth, frequent getting into fights. After many run-ins with the law, he was conscripted into the Imperial Army. While a good soldier, he still had trouble containing his anger, and was almost thrown out of the service twice for striking an officer. He was transferred to Bakura where he served the Imperial Commander there. Panib formerly served under Pter Thanas, where he first met Princess Leia Organa.\nFollowing the attempted Ssi-ruuvi invasion of Bakura in 28 ABY during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Panib took control of Bakura when Prime Minister Molierre Cundertol was abducted. Declaring martial law until Cundertol's return, Panib was forced to retain his emergency powers when it was revealed that Cundertol and Deputy Prime Minister Blaine Harris were working against efforts to join with the Keeramak. When the threat of Cundertol and Harris was quelled, Panib and Lwothin, leader of the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement, signed a treaty and entered into an alliance. Panib sent Bakuran ships to Lwhekk to help with the liberation of the P'w'eck.\nPanib had a short temper, and would frequently brawl when angered. He lacked social graces, and was only courteous to his superior officer Thanas.",
