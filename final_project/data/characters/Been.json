 "content": "Been was a male Otolla Gungan who was a member of the Gungan High Council at the time of the Invasion of Naboo and lived during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\nBeen was the keeper of the ancient records of the Gungans, and knew the locations of many secret Gungan hiding places. During the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, Been supported Boss Rugor Nass' decision to evacuate the population of Otoh Gunga to the sacred place, and later agreed with him in forming an alliance with Queen Padm√© Amidala.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War sometime following 0 BBY, Been could still be found at the sacred place. While there, he employed the help of a spacer. The spacer, who was sympathetic to the Rebellion, was first tasked with retrieving documents from Boona Tanje. After successfully completing the task, Been gave the spacer three more missions. The next mission was to escort a Human female named Reefa Been back to the sacred place. Though the spacer was ambushed by four bandits, Reefa was returned safely. The spacer was then told to kill the bandit leader, and escort an individual named Vajoo Jinssa back to the sacred place. Once again, the spacer failed to let Been down.\nIn the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, Been appeared as a Non-Player Character  in the Gungan sacred place point of interest. Here, players could take a series of quests from Been which involved simple kill, escort, or delivery objectives. Much of his quest dialogue was bugged, and Been was eventually removed from the game.",
