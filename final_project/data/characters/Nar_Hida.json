 "content": "Nar Hida was a human male who left the planet Coruscant as a freighter tramper on board the AA-9 Freighter-Liner Jendirian Valley in 22 BBY. The freighter took off from Westport on Coruscant headed for the Mid Rim Territories planet Naboo. During the journey, Hida traveled in the cargo hold where he sat by one of the starship's walls as flatcakes were being served to passengers. He wore a spiked green cloak and was recognisable by his Luptoomian fashion, which made him more noticeable then other passengers like the disguised Anakin Skywalker and Padm√© Amidala. He had light skin and blue eyes.\nNar Hida appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The scene was filmed in the art department depot of Building 48 at Fox Studios, Sydney. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was first identified in The \"Starship Fact File\" department of the magazine Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon 50, which was written by Tim Veekhoven and published around December 16, 2015. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was created by Gregory Walker under the username \"NarbFlick\" through the StarWars.com Hyperspace feature \"What's The Story?\" in an entry published on September 28, 2006.",
