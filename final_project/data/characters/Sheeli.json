 "content": "Sheeli was a female Twi'lek who lived on Lok during the Galactic Civil War. She was the sister of Choster.\nSheeli had a brother, a skilled engineer named Choster. At some point, Choster was recruited to set up the defenses of the secret hideout of the Sulfur Lake Pirates. Then, he barely escaped death when the pirates attempted to assassinate him when the job was done rather than pay him.\nIn 1 ABY, Choster eagerly accepted to help Nym's Lok Revenants, the enemies of the Sulfur Lake Pirates, to raid the Sulfur Lake Pirate Hideout. However, the pirates then discovered that Choster was involved in the attack. As the engineer was protected by Nym, the pirates instead captured Sheeli. A meeting later took place in Kimogila Town between the Lok Revenants and the Sulfur Lake Pirates. There, the pirate Cale Serasai revealed that they had captured Sheeli and threatened to kill her if the Revenants did not hand over Choster to him. A firefight soon erupted between the two groups of criminals. Although the Lok Revenants were outnumbered, they successfully defended themselves and killed most of the pirates. Cale Serasai survived the fight and was forced to release Sheeli in exchange for his life. The woman was eventually freed and brought to a secret location under the protection of Nym.\nSheeli appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sheeli was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
