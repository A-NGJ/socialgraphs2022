 "content": "Kubariet was a Humanoid male Jedi Knight of the New Jedi Order, and a member of New Republic Intelligence. When the galaxy came under invasion by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong species, Kubariet worked to combat the alien invaders. Three months into the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, Kubariet took part in the defense of the Outer Rim world of New Holgha against the invaders. Injured, he was forced to flee and attempted to reach his starship to get offworld, only to be ambushed by a team of Mandalorians. Mandalorian Protectors under the command of Mand'alor Boba Fett, the soldiers revealed that they had been working against the Yuuzhan Vong under the guise of an alliance, and passed along intelligence they had gathered to Kubariet. Although he was initially doubtful, Kubariet's Force senses allowed him to feel the truth of their claims, and under the escort of the Mandalorian pilot Tiroc Vhon, Kubariet fled New Holgha to deliver the intelligence back to the New Republic while the other Mandalorian soldiers covered his escape by killing the subaltern that had been hunting him.\nTwo weeks later, Kubariet journeyed to Mandalorian space to meet with Boba Fett again. The two landed their vessels on the grassy plains of the planet Vorpa'ya, and agreed to a continued relationship of trading covert intelligence. During the meeting, Kubariet asked Fett to consider constituting a new iteration of the Cuy'val Dar—a group of training sergeants, mostly of Mandalorian background, that had been responsible for instructing the Galactic Republic's clone commando forces during the Clone Wars—to help train planetary militias to fight the Yuuzhan Vong. Fett took the request under consideration, and offered Kubariet a collection of bio-samples from Yuuzhan Vong armor and technology the Mandalorians had collected, which Kubariet happily took for later testing. As the meeting came to an end, Fett had only one further request of Kubariet, which the Jedi readily agreed to: to remember the life of Briika Jeban, which had been lost holding the Yuuzhan Vong subaltern at bay in order to allow Kubariet to make it off of New Holgha alive.\nKubariet continued to combat the Yuuzhan Vong during their invasion, gaining the rank of Jedi Master, and more than once fought alongside the Mandalorian Protectors, including Boba Fett and his trusted lieutenant, Goran Beviin. However, Kubariet eventually died during the course of the war, though he was remembered fondly more than a decade later by Beviin, and Fett long considered Kubariet to be the only Jedi he ever trusted prior to getting to know Jaina Solo.\nKubariet was first to the Star Wars universe in the New Jedi Order e-novella Boba Fett: A Practical Man, written by author Karen Traviss and published in August of 2006. He was later mentioned in Traviss' Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel, Legacy of the Force: Revelation.",
