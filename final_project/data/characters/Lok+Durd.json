 "content": "Lok Durd was a male Neimoidian arms developer who served as a general in the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. He was defeated by Republic forces and was taken into Republic custody. Durd, along with Nuvo Vindi, was part of Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic's original plans for a prisoner exchange with the Confederacy of Independent Systems to secure the release of Galen Erso, Lyra Erso, and the baby Jyn Erso from imprisonment on Vallt. However, Durd eventually managed to escape custody and went on to cause havoc beyond the Western Reaches.\nLok Durd was a corpulent male Neimoidian who operated as an arms developer of the monolithic Trade Federation, eventually participating in the Clone Wars as a general in the Separatist Droid Army. A male Aqualish, Pune Zignat, accompanied Durd during the battle on the planet Maridun, where the Neimoidian wished to test the defoliator against a colony of Lurmen. Zignat was the real developer of the defoliator, but nonetheless, his superior claimed the design as his own creation. An ambitious Separatist officer, General Durd's efforts strove to build a weapon worthy of both a promotion and the approval of the CIS' Head of State, Count Dooku. After running and making an inspection of the Lurmen village, the Neimoidian had the defoliator, which was equipped to a DDT, tested and contacted the Sith Lord. After informing Count Dooku of the weapon's capabilities against all organic matter and harmlessness towards their battle droids, General Durd prepared to move towards the settlement of Chief Tee Watt Kaa. His attempt at a definitive weapon testing proved unsuccessful as the combined efforts of Galactic Republic forces led by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and some of the Lurmen colonists prevented the destruction of the village, resulting in the capture of both the Neimoidian and his Aqualish assistant, Zignat.\nAs part of his plan to liberate the scientist Galen Walton Erso and his family from Vallt, Lieutenant Commander Orson Callan Krennic originally intended to exchange the still-captured General Durd and Doctor Nuvo Vindi for the valued prisoner held by the Confederacy. However, the Neimoidian ultimately escaped from Republic custody to rejoin his Separatist comrades, causing chaos in the Western Reaches and, thus, forcing Krennic to make alterations to his initial designs.\nLok Durd first appeared in \"Defenders of Peace\" from The Clone Wars television series. He was voiced by George Takei, and was intended as a recurring villain, though this never came to pass.",
