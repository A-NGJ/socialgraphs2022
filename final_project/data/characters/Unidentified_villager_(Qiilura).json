 "content": "A Human female villager resided on the Mid Rim planet Qiilura in 22 BBY. In that year, the villager was approached by clone commando RC-1336, who enquired about the whereabouts of Ghez Hokan, a Mandalorian mercenary employed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After initially thinking the commando was Hokan himself due to his armor, she stated that Hokan had taken over the Kirmay clan's farm and used it as a staging area for fifty to sixty of his mercenaries. Once she had passed this information to the commando, she demanded he leave, which he did.\nThe villager appeared in the 2004 novel Hard Contact, which was written by Karen Traviss as the first novel in the Republic Commando series.",
