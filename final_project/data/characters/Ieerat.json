Ieerat carried out a study of the atmosphere of the planet Boonta and the results suggested that a catastrophe that had occurred in the planet's past probably happened after the time of Xim the Despot. This supported the theory that the disaster was caused by the Hutt Boonta, who had suposedly carried out extermination experiments on the world.",
