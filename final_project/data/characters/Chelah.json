When Drayen was poisoned by his enemies with a unknown substance, Chelah froze him in carbonite to stop the progression of the disease. By 3643 BBY, Chelah lived on Nar Shaddaa where he unfroze Drayen and attempted to save him. However, the attempt failed, and Nok Drayen died in Chelah's laboratory.
