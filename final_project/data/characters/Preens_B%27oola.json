 "content": "Preens B'oola was a male Twi'lek criminal who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, B'oola was leading a group of thugs active around Coronet City. In 1 ABY, Preens B'oola assassinated a courier working for the Corellian government in a street of Coronet City. His objective was to steal the government documents that the courier was carrying for ransom. Gallura Handerin, a government aide at the Coronet Capitol, thus tasked a spacer with finding the missing courier. The spacer eventually found the dead courier and a message from B'oola, asking for a huge ransom of 1,000,000 credits. The spacer, who was also working as a CorSec agent for Lieutenant Mack Jasper, tracked Preens B'oola to his camp on the outskirts of Coronet City and finally killed him to recover the government documents.\nPreens B'oola was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nPreens B'oola was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. He was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest,\" the main questline in the game.",
