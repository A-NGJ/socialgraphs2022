 "content": "Forsythia Jin, also known as the \"Assassin Queen\", was the human female Queen of the planet Hynestia and the mother of Princess Rinetta Gan.\nAfter her mother died, Jin did everything necessary to ensure she would get the throne. It was rumored that she had hunted down all twelve of her siblings and personally assassinated them. In reality, she determined that the rules of Hynestia only demanded that people with a claim to the throne and living on Hynestia had to battle to the death. Jin simply relocated all of her siblings off-planet and threatened to go through with a duel if they returned.\nShe had a daughter Rinetta Gan who she would often travel with throughout Wild Space. Sometime after taking the throne, she made a deal with the Galactic Empire to trade gherlian fur in exchange for independence for her planet.\nForsythia Jin visited her daughter in her quarters to tell her that her instructor, Zel Gris, had attempted to steal the Solstice Globe from the Hynestian treasury and fled. The queen informed her daughter that she had the Hynestian Royal Guard and bounty hunters out looking for the Lynna. A guard came up and told the queen that Gris had been found at the Frozen Kova cantina. Jin and her daughter went to confront Gris.\nJin arrived at the cantina and confronted Landonis Balthazar Calrissian who was being held with Gris. The queen introduced herself and explained why they were being detained. After sending Gris to the Hynestian royal dungeon, she turned her attention to Calrissian. She accused him of smuggling purple glandis flower juice and sentenced him to death by being fed to the Gran Kovali. Jin changed her mind when her daughter suggested that Calrissian be the one who delivered the Solstice Globe to the Empire as the Hynestian's usual tribute of gherlian fur had been stolen.\nDiscovering that her daughter had stowed away on the Millennium Falcon, Jin and her royal guard followed the ship to Neral's moon. She boarded the freighter and shot a droid bounty hunter that was threatening L3-37. The queen waited for Calrissian to return and she overheard him tell Princess Gan that he wouldn't deliver the Globe. Disappointed, she took the smuggler into custody and confiscated his ship and L3-37. Jin refused to listen to any explanations and ordered Twyla to put a restraining bolt on the droid.\nReturning to Hynestia, the queen imprisoned Calrissian in the dungeon and went to visit her daughter in her room. She asked why her daughter had stowed away on Calrissian's ship. Gan explained to her mother that she was fulfilling the custom of Gherjnuthal and asked to be freed from confinement to her room. The queen agreed, but insisted that the princess be accompanied by a guard Wyllys and that she stay away from the the docking bays and dungeon.\nJin was waiting in a hangar on Hynestia when the Falcon returned from Livno III. She greeted her daughter as she disembarked from the freighter. She was clad in her training gear and carried a blaster which caused the princess to ponder if her mother was preparing to go after the Falcon. The queen listened to her daughter explain that she had stolen the Solstice Globe to use as bait to lure the thieves that had taken the tribute of gherlian fur. While skeptical, she welcomed her daughter back and ordered her guards to take the fur from the freighter and prepare it for shipping to the Empire. During the unloading, one of the guards found a space rock that had been given to Calrissian by the Lynna. The queen examined it and told the smuggler that it was a chunk of kakaorzum which was extremely valuable. She threatened to take it to cover his fines for smuggling, but decided to let him keep it. She also ordered the guards to ignore any other contraband found on the freighter. She instructed Calrissian and L3-37 to leave the planet immediately and never return.\nSometime later, the Empire decided to take Hynestia. Queen Jin put up a fierce resistance, but eventually the Empire prevailed. When they took the planet, it was deserted except for burned-out gherlian fur domes, a city overrun by kova, and a hologram message from Jin expressing her disdain for the Empire. She led her people to sanctuary on Livno III and retired to a peaceful life on Neral's moon. She lived there anonymously until she died.",
