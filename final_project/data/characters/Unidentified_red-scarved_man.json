 "content": "A human male criminal who wore a red scarf was one of many people stranded at the Amaxine space station in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. The man and his crew, during a fight in the space station's central globe, attempted to abduct Affie Hollow before setting their sights on Nan, another young woman who was small and had difficulty defending herself. Jedi Padawan Reath Silas intervened by cutting one of the man's arms off with his lightsaber. After the man had received medical treatment, he and his crew were summarily kicked off the station.",
