 "content": "A Twi'lek female lived in the South Apartments of the Upper City on the planet Taris during the Jedi Civil War, in 3956 BBY. She had pale yellow skin and blue eyes.\nShortly after an amnesiac Revan, who was a former Dark Lord of the Sith, became stranded on Taris with the conclusion of the attack on the Endar Spire in the space above the planet, he entered the woman's apartment uninvited and frightened her. She begged Revan not to hurt her and to just take whatever he wanted.\nThe Twi'lek appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The player can meet this character during the beginning of the game, after escaping the Endar Spire, by picking or bashing the lock on her apartment door. Her apartment contains a bag with random loot in it and although she begs you not to harm her, she can not be attacked. The game interface lists her name only as \"Twi'lek.\"",
