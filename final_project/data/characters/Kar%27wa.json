 "content": "Kar'wa was a female Twi'lek criminal who was a henchman of a local crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Kar'wa's lieutenants were known as \"Twin Cannons.\"\nKar'wa appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Kar'wa can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon E-85, which appears on the planets Nal Hutta, Ord Mantell, Dromund Kaas, Coruscant, Alderaan, Tatooine, and Voss. The player has the option to kill her or capture her alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord she worked for, where she was encountered, and her fate.",
