 "content": "Ginder was a furred Bimm male from the Genarius-orbiting city of Tolea Biqua who operated as a scavenger and information broker in the Cularin system. Around 31 BBY, while going through a shipment of scrap, Ginder came across the head of an L8O-series protocol droid, L8O-RC. Finding that the head was highly prized by several factions, he sought to offload it before they caught up with him. While attempting to foist the head on a group of freelancers at the Falling Rodian cantina, Ginder found himself in the middle of an all-out fight between some of the factions battling to secure the mysterious treasure, with the head being claimed by the freelancers.\nGinder was a furred Bimm male who operated as a scavenger and information broker around 31 BBY. In his home city of Tolea Biqua, which orbited the gas giant Genarius in the Expansion Region's Cularin system, Ginder happened upon the head of an L8O-series protocol droid, L8O-RC, while looking through a pile of refuse from the local moon of Uffel. Recognizing it as the kind of droid that the former crime lord of the Cularin system, Riboga the Hutt, had used, he surmised that there might be some value in its data and shopped the head around.\nHowever, Ginder's efforts only drew attention from soldiers of the Thaereian military under the command of Colonel Jir Tramsig, as well as a rival gang of thugs attempting to curry favor with Nirama, a mysterious alien who was the leader of the local crime syndicate. Neither party wanted to pay for the head, although they did not press the issue at first, opting to follow the Bimm. Unbeknownst to Ginder, there was also a third group following himâ€”namely, a band of droids from Uffel who were trying to prevent information in the protocol droid head from benefiting anyone else.\nFeeling that he was in an untenable situation, Ginder urgently contacted a group of freelancers to unload the head on them so that he could escape from the city. As he was meeting with the freelancers in the Falling Rodian, a cantina where Ginder had waited intermittently for several afternoons, the soldiers and the thugs showed up, and a battle over the head began. Ginder hid under a table during the brawl, and the head ultimately ended up in the possession of the freelancers.\nGinder loved to haggle and subscribed to the Bimm belief that theft was on a par with murder. Known to be correct more often than he was wrong, Ginder was trustworthy and alert. Norben, the bartender at the Falling Rodian cantina, found Ginder to be often nervous, with the matter surrounding the droid's head making the Bimm more shaky than usual. Despite his usual Bimm enthusiasm when bartering, Ginder was keen to offload the droid's head quickly, underscoring the desperation he felt at his situation. He stood around a meter tall and had tan fur, small dark eyes, an elongated muzzle, and long, floppy ears.\nGinder could speak and write Bimmini; in addition, he could speak Galactic Basic Standard but was not literate in the language. He could also utilize blasters.\nGinder dressed in a yellow pair of trousers and a jacket and carried a small amount of personal belongings with him.\nGinder was created for \"Head Trip,\" a 2001 mini-adventure supplement to the Living Force Campaign Guide from Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game exclusively available at Wizards.com and written by Jeff Grubb. The supplement suggests that the players can personally involve the heroes by mentioning that Ginder's family and their own relatives share connections.\nThe confrontation in the Falling Rodian can be averted entirely if the heroes decide to surrender the head to Tramsig's soldiers, in which case Ginder will protest but acquiesce. If the fight scenario in the Falling Rodian takes place, Ginder can fruitlessly scramble to retrieve the droid head without taking part in the violence; again, however, whether or not this optional event occurs is left up to the players. This article assumes that the events played out as described in the supplement.",
