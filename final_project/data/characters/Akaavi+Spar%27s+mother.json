 "content": "Akaavi Spar's mother was a female Zabrak living during the Great Galactic War. A member of the respected Mandalorian Clan Spar along with her husband, they had a daughter named Akaavi Spar. At the age of three, Spar left her mother to begin her Mandalorian training under her father; this was tradition in the Mandalorian culture, though Spar began several years prior to the more typically accepted age of eight years old. By 3642 BBY Clan Spar was destroyed, with Akaavi left as the only surviving member.\nAkaavi Spar's mother is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Akaavi Spar companion mission.",
