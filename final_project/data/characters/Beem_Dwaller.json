In about 32 BBY, some specimen samples belonging to the company Culpharm went missing and the Heroes of Cularin, who had been hired to find them, spoke to Dwaller during the course of their investigation. Dwaller informed them that, during the time that the samples went missing, the Culpharm security guard Caleb Clancy was at a picnic.",
