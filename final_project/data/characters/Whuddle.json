 "content": "Whuddle was a Hutt on Tatooine during the Cold War. At one point Whuddle possessed the mother of Vette and Tivva as a slave but she was worked to death. When the sisters discovered the matter, Tivva suggested taking revenge on the Hutt.\nThe Sith master of Vette encouraged it. Reluctantly, Vette slew the Hutt who killed her mother with Tivva, but quickly regretted it and resented the Sith for advising it.\nThe Sith Warrior can advise Vette to not pursue vengeance against Whuddle for light alignment points.",
