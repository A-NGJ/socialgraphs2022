 "content": "Kueller was an Almanian army general who lived hundreds of years before the Almanian Uprising. He overtook Almania and then the entire Almanian sector. In his later years, he was a beloved leader who was known for his compassion and his decisiveness. However, early on while he was conquering, he was very ruthless and would do anything to consolidate his power.\nIn 17 ABY, the Dark Jedi Dolph took up the name \"Kueller\", and tried to model himself on the general.",
