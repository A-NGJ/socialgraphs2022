 "content": "Stev Brygies was a male Human soldier of the Galactic Republic stationed on Hoth during the Cold War along with Jon Brygies, his relative. Both were killed by Imperial-affiliated individuals around 3642 BBY.\nStev Brygies appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Hoth. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
