 "content": "Jarrti'Klomas was a male Twi'lek, who lived on the planet Ryloth during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nKlomas was captured by slavers, but was rescued by Jedi Master Vhiin Thorla and went to live in The Enclave, a community of outcasts that Thorla had established on Ryloth. Klomas became the unofficial head of The Enclave's security force.\nKlomas disliked slavers and believed that Thorla was too good-natured, and should be more aggressive in dealing with slavers. He believed that if more people were freed from the slavers, then they could fight the slavers and rid Ryloth of them.",
