 "content": "A human female from the portion of the galaxy known as Lesser Space piloted a massive Lesser Space starship alongside the Chiss Syndic Mitth'ras'safis \"Thrass\" as the ship crashed during the Vagaari pirate operations by 19 BBY. She acted as co-pilot to Thrass while trying to save innocent human survivors aboard the vessel. The pair understood that either they would die or the others on the ship would, and gave their lives to save the others. Before dying, the human female and Thrass expressed their desire for humans and Chiss to work side-by-side in peace someday.\nThe human woman appeared in the last flashback sequence in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final installment of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy. She corresponds to the character Lorana Jinzler from Star Wars Legends, who appeared in Zahn's 2006 novel Outbound Flight. The woman's dialogue with Thrass in Lesser Evil is identical to some of the dialogue between Jinzler and Thrass' Legends counterpart in Outbound Flight. The plot of Outbound Flight was largely incorporated into current canon via the Vagaari pirate operations. Prior to Outbound Flight, Jinzler's unidentified skeletal remains appeared in Zahn's 2004 novel Survivor's Quest.",
