 "content": "FN-1971 was the designation of a human stormtrooper who was a member of the First Order's FN Corps. FN-1971 would sneak in comics based on the animated program Kade Genti, Master of Section Nine, and gave them to a young stormtrooper, FN-2187, to read and enjoy. The two were aware that their actions were against regulation and would have led to reprogramming if they were caught. Around 34 ABY, FN-2187, by then a member of the Resistance who adopted the name \"Finn,\" remembered reading the comics provided by FN-1971 and chose to use the name of the show's protagonist, Kade Genti, as an alias when going undercover at an auction hosted at Coronet City on the Core Worlds planet Corellia.\nFN-1971 was mentioned in Resistance Reborn, a 2019 novel written by Rebecca Roanhorse. The character's designation corresponds with Roanhorse's year of birth, 1971.",
