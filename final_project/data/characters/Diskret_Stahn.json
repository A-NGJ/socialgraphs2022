 "content": "Captain Diskret Stahn was a Bothan pilot. For a fee, he transported beings to their destinations in his small freighter. He had traveled much of the galaxy, including the Abregado system.\nHis ship came under attack by pirates while he was transporting dancer Pei Yi to Naboo. His ship's engine was damaged in the attack, though he was able to land on Mustafar for repairs and supplies. He was stranded on the Mensix Mining Facility with Yi for a long period of time.\nWhile he was stranded, an entertaining spacer was there and decided to talk to him. He told him his story and also taught him this tune that was stuck in his head while he was in space. The spacer eventually turned the tune into a song: Calypso\nDiskret Stahn appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
