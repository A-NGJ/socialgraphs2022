 "content": "Kalback was a Mon Calamari Admiral of the New Republic and a distal pod-cousin of Admiral Gial Ackbar. He was in his sixties at the time of his final command.\nIn 5 ABY, Admiral Ackbar temporarily placed the New Republic Third Fleet in the hands of Admirals Kalback and Willham Burke, who jointly worked to sever the forces of Imperial warlord Treuten Teradoc from the Core Worlds. Leading the fleet from the Mon Calamari Star Cruisers Justice and Remember Alderaan, the pair bested the warlord's task force at Togoria and fought their way to the planet Lantillies on the Perlemian Trade Route, where they connected with the forces fielded by the planet Contruum. Having established a hold on the Perlemian, the two admirals headed in different directions; while Burke pressed Coreward to Chazwa, Kalback headed for Corsin, attempting to secure a position on the Hydian Way. This attempt failed, as Kalback's ships were met by warlord Zsinj's Executor-class Star Dreadnought Iron Fist. He fell back to Obroa-skai, where his forces were added to General Luke Skywalker's Rapid Response Task Force.\nDuring the Battle of Mindor, he commanded the task force's naval elements from the Justice. He was confident in the abilities of Luke Skywalker and accepted the surrender of Lord Shadowspawn during the initial phase of the battle. This turned out to be a ruse, and Kalback met his death on the bridge of the Justice after a rigged shuttle destroyed his ship, taking a console corner to the head during the series of impacts. Skywalker commended the spirit of the deceased Admiral to the Force.",
