 "content": "Feen Fenoob was a bald, male Sullustan who had black eyes and lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Through gambling, he came to owe a large debt to the Black Sun crime syndicate vigo Darnada. Fenoob failed to pay off the debt leading to two of Darnada's thugs tracking him down on the Deep Space Demolition and Removal Space station. Fenoob escaped the thugs but was killed by the Sith apprentice Darth Maul immediately afterwards.\nBy the year 33 BBY, the male Sullustan Feen Fenoob had amassed a debt through gambling, which he owed to the Dug Darnada, a vigo of the Black Sun criminal organization. In that year, Darnada sent two of his men, Asa Naga and the Wookiee Gargachykk, to track down Fenoob on board the Deep Space Demolition and Removal space station, which the vigo used as a base of operations. Fenoob attempted to escape the pair, but only succeeded in wearing himself out before they confronted him in one of the station's hangars where the Sullustan tried to hide. Naga reminded him of the debt and claimed that he believed the Sullustan would pay up, although also mentioning the fact that Gargachykk doubted it. After Naga threatened to have the Wookiee pull Fenoob's arms out of their sockets, the Sullustan stunned the pair with several flash globes he was carrying and fled. His escape was cut short, though, as the Sith apprentice Darth Maul bisected the fleeing debtee with his lightsaber, hoping to use the Sullustan's death as a mean of earning Naga's trust so that he would be granted audience with Darnada.\nFenoob gambled to a point where he owed a large debt to the dangerous criminal Darnada. He attempted to flee Darnda's thugs when he discovered they were after him, becoming panicked as he did. Upon being caught he managed to outwit his captors—one of whom claimed he believed Fenoob would pay the debt while the other didn't—and stun them to escape, making sarcastic comment as he did so. As a Sullustan, Fenoob was bald, with pale colored skin and black eyes. At the time of his death he wore an orange jacket and shirt with a pair of brown pants.\nFeen Fenoob first appeared in 2000 in Darth Maul  2 a comic book in the Star Wars: Darth Maul series written by Ron Marz and illustrated by Jan Duursema. He later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia in 2008.",
