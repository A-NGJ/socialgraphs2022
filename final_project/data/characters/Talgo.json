 "content": "Talgo was a male Cathar who served as a sergeant in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. In 3640 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Ilum while a battle took place there. During the battle, Talgo sold equipment from a stall in the Republic base camp. While at the stall, he wore white and purple armor with a backpack. Talgo had orange eyes and brown skin and hair.\nTalgo appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as an endgame gear vendor for Republic players on Ilum, though his actual title varied throughout his time in the game. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Talgo was removed from the game. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
