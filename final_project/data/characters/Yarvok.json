 "content": "Yarvok was a male Human lieutenant and leader of the Nova Blades pirate gang living during the third Galactic War. In 3627 BBY, the Nova Blades—who were led by Yarvok and payed by the Sith Empire—launched the Dantooine Incursion. During the fighting, Yarvok went rogue and with his crew gained control of the Dantooine Power Station, requesting a ransom of fifteen million credits be paid to his astromech droid R0-B5U in exchange for its reactor.\nBy the next year, Yarvok's beast wrangler Krupo lost many of Yarvok's prized pets when Krupo's ship crashed on Dantooine, angering Yarvok. Yarvok threatened to kill Krupo if his missing pets were not located and returned to him at once, as Yarvok feared for their safety.\nYarvok was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the digital expansion Knights of the Eternal Throne in the Dantooine Incursion. If the player pays Yarvok the fifteen million credits he demands he will leave peacefully, otherwise, the player will need to defeat him in battle to urge him to go.",
