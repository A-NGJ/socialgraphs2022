 "content": "Whip was a young Human male with extraordinary reflexes who lived on the planet Dathomir in the village of Aurilia during the Galactic Civil War. He was alleged to be the best pilot there. His personal hatred of the Galactic Empire stemmed from its ban on podracing. Whip reasoned that, if not for the podracing ban, he would be a rich and famous racerâ€”in his estimation, the best in the galaxy.\nHe tasked a Force-sensitive individual with rescuing five members of the village who went missing after the Sith Shadows attacked the village. Later he tasked the individual with retrieving the cargo from downed cargo ships that were shot down by the Shadows en route from Endor. As a reward, he helped train the individual in the ways of the Force.\nWhip appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
