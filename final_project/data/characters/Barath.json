 "content": "Barath was a human TIE fighter pilot who flew as part of the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. As part of a squadron led by Captain Nosteen, Barath took part in a genocide on the planet Nacronis. While defending TIE/sa bombers from New Republic X-wing starfighters, the pilot was killed by a missile. Nosteen's second-in-command, Yrica Quell, defected from the Empire after and lied to the New Republic that Barath had died trying to join her.\nA human TIE fighter pilot, Barath flew with the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing as a part of a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter squadron led by Captain Nosteen. Two weeks after the Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine in 4 ABY, the 204th was tasked with the destruction of all life on the planet Nacronis as a part of the Emperor's contingency plan Operation: Cinder. Barath and the rest of the pilot's squadron was assigned to protect TIE/sa bombers carrying vortex detonators. However, as enemy X-wing starfighters engaged the TIE squadron, Barath was killed by a surface-to-air missile.\nThe vortex detonators successfully devastated Nacronis by stoking siltstorms. Following the genocide, Lieutenant Yrica Quell, Nosteen's second-in-command, defected to the New Republic and told one of it's interrogation droids an alternate story of her defection where she, Barath and the pilot Tonas defected together but Barath and Tonas were killed in the process. In 11 ABY, Quell thought about Barath when she flew a Helotek Loadhauler shuttle.\nBarath was first mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the first volume in the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron series, written by Alexander Freed.",
