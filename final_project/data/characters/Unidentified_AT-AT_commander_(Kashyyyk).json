 "content": "This unidentified AT-AT commander commanded three AT-AT walkers during a skirmish with Rebel Alliance and Wookiee forces led by Lieutenant Valeria. Though initially confident of victory, his walkers were destroyed by the Arrowhead. Following the skirmish, the walker commander was picked up by commander Estoc's Imperial Star Destroyer Desolator. The AT-AT commander was present when the Desolator and several Star Destroyers were destroyed by the Arrowhead during a battle near Alzoc III.\nThe Unidentified AT-AT commander first appeared in the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two episode \"A Perilous Rescue\", which first premiered on Disney XD on August 10, 2017. He was voiced by Matthew Wood, who was credited as \"Walker Commander\" in the end credits.",
