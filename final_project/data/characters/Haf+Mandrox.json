 "content": "Haf Mandrox was a Human male lieutenant for Borvo the Hutt's Nal Raka Criminal Empire during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nHaf Mandrox was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Haf Mandrox spawned under the generic \"thug\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of thirty-five possible depictions. Species Haf Mandrox could appear as included Aqualish, Bith, Bothans, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak under either gender. Because the quest dialogue identified Mandrox as a Human male, this article assumes that one of the three randomly generated Human male depictions is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
