 "content": "Bren-Jules Rordan was a Commission for the Preservation of the New Order. He joined the Sub-Adult Group as a teenager and became an Observer before joining the Imperial Security Bureau's Surveillance branch. Rordan was not very bright or observant, but excelled at covering himself by passing the blame and telling his superiors what they wanted to hear. Following the Battle of Endor, he was assigned to Kirima and ran B. J. Rordan's Collectables. His employees were all employed by various other intelligence agencies vying for power in the Kalinda system.",
