 "content": "Vikar Dorn was a male Human governor from Munto Codru who formerly served the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances until he swore his allegiance to Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War.\nVikar Dorn served under the banner of the late Galactic Alliance, though he maintained his position during the rule of the Sith Empire, as the latter system needed the Alliance's bureaucracy to manage the galaxy following the Sithâ€“Imperial War. Dorn's son was captain of the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Dauntless.\nIn 137 ABY, Sith Lady Darth Maladi used him in an attempt to infiltrate Bastion and have Darth Kruhl kill Roan Fel using the defection of Governor Dorn and the entire crew of the Dauntless as bait.\nHowever, Kruhl's mission failed and the Sith Lord was killed by Roan Fel himself. With the treachery discovered, Emperor Fel had the entire crew of the Dauntless executed with only Governor Dorn being spared. He was dropped off in an escape pod close to Krayt-loyal ships and made his way back to Coruscant, carrying Kruhl's lightsaber with him. After revealing what happened to Lady Maladi and assuring her that he had not spoken to anyone else, he was killed by the Sith Lady herself.",
