 "content": "Lela Nalle Mayn was a female Human from Commenor who studied architecture at Coruscant University. As one of the Nalle triplets she worked for the corrupt Mayor Acros-Krik as a spy and was in the Outlander Club on Coruscant before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. Of the three sisters she was the only one to be married at that time. She was also the mother of New Republic starfighter pilot Todra Mayn.\nLela Nalle Mayn was one of three Outlander Club patrons portrayed by Amy Allen in Attack of the Clones. The name Lela Mayn is an anagram of \"Amy Allen.\" It was initially unknown whether Lela was the third Nalle triplet, but the appearance of one of the sisters in Evasive Action: Recruitment being very much like her costume in Attack of the Clones strongly suggested it. Lela Mayn's entry in StarWars.com's original Databank later confirmed that she was the third triplet, with Mayn being her married name.",
