 "content": "Stanz was the Captain of the cargo hauler Freebird who offered to buy ore cheap from the colonists on New Brigia. Negus Nigekus, a colonist believed him to be a pirate at heart because he gave them very little credits for their ore. The \"Freebird\" was the only cargo hauler that came to New Brigia, so the colonists had no choice. It is unknown if he was on New Brigia when it was attacked by the Yevetha in 16 ABY.",
