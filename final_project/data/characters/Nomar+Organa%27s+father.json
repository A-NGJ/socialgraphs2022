 "content": "A Human male was a member of the planet Alderaan's noble House Organa and the father of Nomar Organa. The man was the fourth youngest son of his House in his generation, with his eldest brother serving as the lord of House Organa sometime well before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. When Nomar exhibited Force-sensitivity at a young age, his uncle gave his brother's son to the Jedi Order as a gift, and Nomar did not return to Alderaan until he was a young man and a Padawan.\nNomar Organa's father was first mentioned in Nomar's entry in the Codex for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011.",
