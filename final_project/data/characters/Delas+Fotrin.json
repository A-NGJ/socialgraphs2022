 "content": "Delas Fotrin was a male Human, who served in the Thaereian military during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nFotrin became a Captain in the Thaereian military. However, while flying a G-59 Cannibalizer above the moon Tilnes as a part of a routine patrol, he encountered an atmospheric disturbance and crash landed. However, his ship punctuated the crust of Tilnes and plumeted down, landing in a mineshaft deep beneath the surface. Fotrin was unable to extracate himself and could not activate his homing beacon because doing so would go against Order 1138. He recorded a short hologram and then died soon afterwards.\nRoughly ten years later, in about 31 BBY, the ship and Fotrin's body were discovered by the Heroes of Cularin.",
