 "content": "Bialy was a female Human Sergeant who served as a member of the Royal Naboo Security Forces and a partner to Lieutenant Quarsh Panaka around 36 BBY. Together, they went on a mission and took the Gungan Kroke Modbom from Port Landien and delivered him to Maris Magneta. Later she accompanied Panaka during his guard duty, but was too far away to help him when he was nearly killed by Veermok. She was later in the debriefing of the present contract, after Sate Pestage had shot Veermok.",
