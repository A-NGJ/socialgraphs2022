 "content": "A Kubaz operated as a spy for the Galactic Empire sometime during the Galactic Civil War. The Kubaz was present on Sarka and was informed by Lord Rooz that Sarka would continue selling its gems to the Imperials. The spy then informed the imprisoned Luke Skywalker that Darth Vader would arrive soon and he would tell Vader that Skywalker was on Sarka. Eventually, he was thrown into the cell, where he took a nap before Rooz was also imprisoned.",
