 "content": "Cyrans the Unfeeling was usually found near the entrance to the Dead Forest in the Kkowir Forest on Kashyyyk, and, as his name implies, he could not feel, which suggested he was dead.\nCyrans along with his fellow Sayormi constantly raided the Wookiee settlement of Kerritamba Village in hopes of eventually eradicating them and taking their home. Although seemingly dead already, he was murdered along with the Sayormi Queen by an outsider hired by the Wookiee chief Kerritamba.\nCyrans was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
