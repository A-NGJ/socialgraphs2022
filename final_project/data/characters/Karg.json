 "content": "Commander Karg was a Human male who served as an Imperial officer just prior to the Battle of Yavin.\nAccording to his own claim, his father was an admiral in the Imperial Navy during the time of the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, Karg received an order from Darth Vader to find the Tantive IV after Princess Leia Organa was placed under arrest. When he landed on the planet of Kattada to arrest Leia and Mia Ikova, he was almost killed by the Tantive IV turbolasers and was badly wounded. Leia took Karg onboard Tantive IV to treat his injuries. Several hours later and a few minutes after Mia Ikova's death, Karg died from his extensive injuries.",
