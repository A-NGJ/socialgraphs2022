 "content": "This clone was a cadet and participated in the Battle of Kamino. During the assault on Tipoca City, this cadet and four other members of his squad got separated from the main group and encountered clone troopers Echo, Fives, and 99. The cadets were then led inside to safety.\nAfter they were joined by Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex, the older clones prepared the cadets for battle, as the battle droids were continuing to advance. The cadets began to grow nervous, with this cadet exclaiming that their training was not finished. However, Echo and Fives imparted some passionate words onto the young cadets to reassure and invigorate them for the upcoming fight. 99 led the clones to a nearby armory, where the group grabbed several DC-15A blaster carbines for the cadets as well as grenades. The cadets were stationed inside the beds that retracted into the wall, and when a platoon of B1-series battle droids attacked them, they launched a surprise attack from above. The cadet survived the battle but witnessed the tragic death of 99.",
