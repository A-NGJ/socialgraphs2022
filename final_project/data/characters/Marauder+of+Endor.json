 "content": "A male Sanyassan known as the \"Marauder of Endor\" was a criminal whom law enforcement agencies wished to apprehend. A former acquaintance of Terak, Sanyassan warlord and King of the Marauders, he was featured on a wanted poster.\nThe Marauder of Endor had a hologram of his third mother on right forelock, shaved dimples on both elbows and mushrooms lining eyebrows.\nBesides Terak, the Marauder was also a known associate of s12x \"Lefty\" pTTt, most of the Muldoon family, Father FFKR and Morgantha Shelroon.\nHe once escaped the Devil's Asteroid and by that time, he employed fusion weapons and disease chambers. He had at least 79 convictions and counts for the following felonies: plutonic detonation, interdimensional kidnapping, star swapping, molecular mayhem, as well as numerous unpaid docking tickets, which led to the authorities to recommend extreme caution and to approach only with benzene applicators.\nThe Marauder of Endor featured in a one-page wanted poster, written by Bob Carrau for the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that combines creature designs and photographs from various projects of George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise, with original text by Carrau. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical.",
