 "content": "Droma Ordo was a male Chiss who lived during the Galactic Civil War. He was a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Droma Ordo was stationed in Anchorhead on Tatooine, along with Captain Carh'la Bastra, and both recruited new members to join the Rebellion's cause. He was also in contact with Jorund Redd, a Rebel sympathizer living in Mos Eisley.\nIn 1 ABY, Ordo recruited a spacer to perform several missions to aid the Alliance. One such mission was to thin out the Bantha population around Anchorhead to decrease the number of Imperial patrols as sandtroopers had begun using Banthas in addition to the reptilian Dewbacks. Another was to retrieve stolen codes from a terrorist group that operated near Anchorhead. The third was retrieve a RX-8 modulator from an AT-AT leg stored at a high-security compound run by the Valarian Syndicate to test a new jamming program. The trooper was spotted by a squad of mercenaries who attempted to give Imperial troops information about the mission. The trooper followed the mercenaries to an Imperial outpost near Bestine where the trooper eliminated the squad and returned to Ordo. Ordo gave the trooper fragmentation grenades as a reward then informed the trooper that, due to an Imperial investigation, he would no longer be giving missions.\nDroma Ordo appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Droma Ordo was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
