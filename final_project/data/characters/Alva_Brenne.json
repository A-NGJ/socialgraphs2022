 "content": "Alva Brenne was a human female who served in the Galactic Empire as a colonel and Chief Imperial Architect. She was responsible for transforming the Imperial Palace from its former identity as the Jedi Temple of the old Jedi Order. During the reign of the Empire, she was assigned by Emperor Palpatine to design whatever Darth Vader deemed necessary on his own planet of Mustafar. While designing a castle for Lord Vader, Brenne was murdered by Lieutenant Roggo who had been possessed by the mask of the ancient Sith Lord Darth Momin.\nAlva Brenne was a human female who served as a colonel and Chief Imperial Architect for the Galactic Empire. In 19 BBY, following the rise of the Empire and the fall of the Jedi Order, Brenne oversaw the alterations made to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. All traces of the Jedi were wiped, and the temple was transformed into Emperor Palpatine's Imperial Palace. Pleased with Brenne's work on the Imperial Palace, Emperor Palpatine assigned Brenne to design Darth Vader's stronghold on the planet Mustafar, along with anything else the Dark Lord deemed appropriate.\nFollowing the Rogue Inquisitor chase on Coruscant, Colonel Brenne and Lieutenant Roggo accompanied Darth Vader aboard the Naboo Royal Starship on a trip to Mustafar. As they were approaching Mustafar, Vader informed Brenne that he was to take control of the ship once they entered Mustafar's orbit. Aboard the starship, Brenne and Roggo pondered what aesthetic would best suit the Dark Lord's fortress. Brenne initially believed Vader would prefer a minimalist approach to his castle, but the elegant design of Vader's J-type 327 Nubian starship made Brenne doubt her conclusion. An ancient, \"sinister\" mask aboard the ship caught the eye of Brenne and Roggo. Unbeknownst to the two imperials, the mask housed the spirit of it's once owner, the Sith Lord Darth Momin.\nWhile entering Mustafar's atmosphere, Brenne and Roggo were alerted by the ship's safety system that the external hull temperatures had reached critical levels. Upon further examination, Roggo discovered the Nubian starship was entering Mustafar's atmosphere without any shields. Despite the their pleads, the pilot, Vader, refused to turn the starship shields's back on. In a panic Brenne reached for her blaster, but she was quickly disarmed by the Dark Lord, who reiterate that the Emperor had placed her and Roggo under Vader's authority. The three landed on the Gahenn Plains near a Sith cave Vader had previously visited. The once pristine mirror finished hull of the Nubian starship had melted to a crisp as a result of Vader's hazardous approach. Upon seeing the ship exterior, Brenne stated to Roggo that she now had a better understanding of Darth Vader's aesthetic.\nAlva Brenne immediately began her work designing Darth Vader's castle. At first Brenne took a basic, functional approuch when designing Vader's fortress. After scouting the natural landmarks, Brenne concluded she would have the initial castle designs finished in four to five hours. The natural lava flow that ran over the Sith Cave into was planned to be incorporated into the castle's design. Brenne presented her finished castle schematics to Vader, however, the Sith Lord was unimpressed with the design. Setback, Brenne retreated to retool the designs in hopes of pleasing the dark lord.\nWhile Colonel Brenne was presenting her designs to Lord Vader, the spirit of Lord Momin that was hosted within the ancient mask had taken possession of Roggo. When Brenne returned to the ship to rework her designs, Roggo, now a host for Momin, shot and murdered Brenne. Momin then began to create his own design for Darth Vader's castle. Brenne's corpse was quickly discovered by Lord Vader, who swiftly cut down murderer Roggo with his lightsaber.\nDespite the death of Roggo, Momin's spirit remained unharmed within his mask. Momin communed with Darth Vader, and the two Sith Lords agreed to cooperate to further their goals. Momin was to continue to design Vader's castle, which would now act as a doorway through the force that could tune the energies of the dark side locus on Mustafar. Alva Brenne's designs for the fortress were unused by Momin, who instead opted to used his own approach when designing the castle.\nAlva Brenne was a human female that had light skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes. Brenne was highly regarded by Emperor Palpatine, who described her work as \"very good.\" She was confident in her work as an architect, but had doubts that she would be able to design a fortress that would please Darth Vader.\nAs a Colonel in the Imperial Officer Corps, Alva Brenne wore the standard olive uniform, with a Rank insignia plaque displaying 4 red squares over 4 blue. On her mission to Mustafar, Brenne carried a SE-14r light repeating blaster holstered to her hip.\nColonel Alva Brenne made her first appearance in Darth Vader  21 which was released on September 12, 2018. This was her first, and only appearance in the comic series, however she was directly mentioned in the opening crawl of the following issue, Darth Vader  22.",
