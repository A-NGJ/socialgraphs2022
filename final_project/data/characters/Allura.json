 "content": "Allura was a Human female entertainer who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, she resided in Mos Eisley and used to perform in Chalmun's Cantina. In 1 ABY, Allura encountered a spacer in the cantina who was recommended and sent by one of her friend by the name Trehla Keelo. The spacer had just landed on Tatooine and was looking for work. Allura therefore agreed with teaching some of her dance moves.\nAllura was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nAllura was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. She was part of an introductory questline intended to help new players who spawned on Tatooine right after the completion of the \"New Player Tutorial\" to chose their \"profession\". Allura's quest was removed from the game upon the overhaul of the \"profession\" system with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
