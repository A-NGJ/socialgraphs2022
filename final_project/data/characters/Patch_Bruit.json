 "content": "Patch Bruit was Lommite Limited's chief of field operations in 33 BBY. Although he served the company for nearly twenty years, working his way up from the lommite pits, he had long dreamed of starting over and relocating to Coruscant or one of the other Core worlds and making a new life for himself. After being ordered by Jurnel Arrant to hire the Toom clan to sabotage rival InterGalactic Ore, the Tooms betrayed him and sabotaged both LL and InterGal. Working with Caba'Zan, he led an assault on the clan's hideout on Riome. Following the clan's defeat, he was Force choked to death by Darth Maul. Darth Maul went on to frame Bruit for his actions sabotaging the two companies.",
