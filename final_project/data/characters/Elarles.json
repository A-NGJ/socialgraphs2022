 "content": "Elarles was a Human male waiter at a tavern located in one of the Imperial energy mining facilities on Circarpous V.\nWhen taking orders, he would remain distant from customers since he wanted to keep the substance that he smoked while working from making them lose their appetite.\nAround 2 ABY, Elarles noted something suspicious about two supposed miners that he was waiting on. Though the male had the calloused hands of a typical miner, his female companion did not. Elarles informed a nearby Imperial bureaucrat of his suspicions.",
