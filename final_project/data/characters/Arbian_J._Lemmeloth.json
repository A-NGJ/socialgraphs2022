 "content": "Arbian J. Lemmeloth was a male Human Republic Intelligence agent who was tasked to spy\non Republic Treasury Audit Division agent Besany Wennen. While tailing her through the streets of Coruscant, he was surprised from behind by Null Arc Ordo Skirata and the Wookiee Enacca. Abducted into a speeder, he was scanned and Ordo learned that Lemmeloth had a high security clearance and was a mere two promotions shy from reporting directly to the Supreme Chancellor.\nAfter slicing into the secure comm system of Republic Intelligence, Ordo sent a message clearing Wennen of any wrong doings before killing Lemmeloth with a direct shot to the head. His body was left on the lower levels for the borrats to consume.",
