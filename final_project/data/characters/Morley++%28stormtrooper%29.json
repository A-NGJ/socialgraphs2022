 "content": "Morley was a Human male stormtrooper sergeant who served in the Stormtrooper Corps during the Galactic Civil War. He spoke with a characteristic drawl.\nIn 1 BBY, he was assigned aboard the Star Destroyer Imperator. He was a squad leader in the platoon assigned to Cadet Leader Kyle Katarn during the assault on AX-456. He was ordered to blow the lock to the installation and on Kyle's command he triggered the remote. As soon as Kyle was inside the opened hatch, Morley brushed past him to do the same with the inside door, and quickly blew it off. He shoved the slab of metal only to receive Rebel blaster fire, but was saved thanks to his reflective armor. The room was cleared of the Rebels with grenades.\nAs they fought their way into the second room, Morley was killed by more fire. Katarn, in turn, shot and killed Morley's killerâ€”a young boy.",
