 "content": "Lord Isamer was a Lasat male who was one of the leaders in the Directorate criminal organization. He was approached by the Hutts to destabilize the local governments of Eiram and E'ronoh. Isamer initiated a crisis by kidnapping their respective monarchs, holding them on the lost moon between the twin planets. However, Isamer's lieutenants kidnapped Thandeka, the queen consort of Eiram, rather than the true ruler, Queen Dima. After the Jedi Order sent a T-1 shuttle to the Eiram system to respond to the crisis, Isamer had his lieutenants use the communications array of Monarch Cassel of E'ronoh's wrecked starship to trick the Jedi into coming to the moon. Once there, the Directorate shot the shuttle down on Isamer's order. However, when Isamer's men inspected the crash and reported that there was only one Jedi body on board, he put them on high alert, convinced that there were more Jedi attached to the mission. However, he was unaware that his base in the caves had an unknown entrance, which the Jedi eventually used to ambush him. However, he did not surrender, and instead shot at the captured royals, forcing Jedi Master Laret Soveral to cut him in half, killing him. His shots still found a target, and killed Monarch Cassel.",
