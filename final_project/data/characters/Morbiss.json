 "content": "Morbiss was a Hutt slaver who operated at some point around the time of the reign of the Galactic Empire. Morbiss was based on the moon Nar Shaddaa and he had enemies throughout the Outer Rim Territories, and he employed a large retinue of thugs to protect him from his rivals. However, while on a visit to the planet Malastare to bet on the world's podraces, an opponent of Morbiss detonated a bomb aboard the Hutt's starship, resulting in the death of the slaver.",
