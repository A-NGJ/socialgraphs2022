 "content": "Tripton was a male Human who held the position of Field Commander in the Imperial Army of the Sith Empire. Tripton was among the soldiers sent to secure the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas, but he was driven insane by the dark side energy and spirits in the Temple, and was later killed.\nTripton appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on the planet Dromund Kaas. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed by any Imperial character for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
