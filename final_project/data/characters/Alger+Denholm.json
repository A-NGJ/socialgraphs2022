 "content": "Alger Denholm was a human male officer of the Galactic Empire who served aboard the Star Destroyer Exactor. Supposedly, Denholm was promoted after his superior, Lieutenant Marsden, was killed by Darth Vader, but began to see visions of Marsden. When Vader boarded the Exactor in a shuttle, Denholm had a vision of Marsden's death, and collided with Vader in his hysteria. Vader choked Denholm to death using the Force, and he was replaced by the officer Saul Toten.",
