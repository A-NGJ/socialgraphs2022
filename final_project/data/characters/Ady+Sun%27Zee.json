 "content": "Ady Sun'Zee was a Mirialan female Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order. After Sun'Zee sent a distress call to the Jedi Council, it was answered by Jedi Master Yoda. Ady Sun'Zee wielded a standard blue lightsaber.\nDuring the High Republic Era, the Jedi Order established several outposts on Outer Rim worlds, including a research facility for rare artifacts on Batuu.\nAt one point, Ady Sun'Zee and her Jedi Master Sylwin brought the Ancient Sith Runestone to the Jedi outpost. There, Sun'Zee was corrupted by it and killed her master, Sylwin. Days later, when Master Yoda arrived in response to her distress call, she had forgotten everything. He told her to wait while he looked around, but Sun'Zee was still confused, entering a tunnel with corrupted vines which emanated from the relic. On the way, she was attacked by demlins, and upon entering the room where the relic was located, she heard herself and her master taunting her. Sun'Zee experienced dark visions upon handling the relic again, but was able to overpower them after hearing Yoda calling to her. Upon finding Yoda again, Sun'Zee was able to overcome the relic with the Force and seal it away permanently.\nIn the years that followed, Sun'Zee was unable to find a new master due to to the sudden outbreak of the Great Hyperspace Disaster and the invasion of the Nihil. Although attachments were usually forbidden, Sunzee sought solace by utilizing her fallen master's kyber crystal to power her own blade. Eventually she was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and took on the Urodel Padawan Nooa as her apprentice. The two went on a training exercise to Valron, where Sylwin had taken Ady during her own apprenticeship.\nIn 34 ABY, Seezelslak told her story to a droid repair technician in his cantina, stating that she had hidden the key to the temple somewhere on Batuu, and wondered if it still existed.",
