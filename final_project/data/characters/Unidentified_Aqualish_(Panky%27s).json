 "content": "An Aqualish male was present at the diner of Panky's in 27 BBY. At that time, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Padawans Anakin Skywalker and Lorana Jinzler were also present, who were in fact, following Passel Argente's bodyguard, Jerv Riske. In an attempt to eavesdrop on a conversation between the diner's bartender and Riske, Kenobi and Skywalker got near the Aqualish, and the bodyguard, however, Skywalker accidentally punched the Aqualish's drink. After he lost some drops of his drink, the Aqualish entered a rage and almost attacked the Jedi Padawan. However, Kenobi told him that they were sorry, and that it had been an accident, and bought a bigger drink to avoid a fight. Then, the Aqualish told Kenobi that his apprentice required self-discipline.\nThe Aqualish appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2006 novel Outbound Flight.",
