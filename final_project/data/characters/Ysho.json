 "content": "Ysho was a male Ithorian lawyer who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he was the advocate of Lady Valarian, the leader of the Valarian criminal syndicate on Tatooine. In 1 ABY, Lady Valarian's lieutenant Kavas Urdano tasked a spacer with delivering an official proclamation to Ysho in Mos Eisley. The spacer and the Ithorian were then attacked by three henchmen working for Jabba the Hutt, Valarian's main rival, but the spacer killed them all and successfully defended Ysho.\nYsho was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ysho was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Ysho was consequently removed from the game.",
