 "content": "This Shadow Guard was a Human male who was part of the Emperor's Shadow Guard, and was stationed on Nar Shaddaa. He was killed when Darth Vader's apprentice, Galen Marek, arrived on the planet in search of Jedi Rahm Kota.\nAt some point, he became an Emperor's Shadow Guard, elite guardsmen of the Emperor's Royal Guard. In 2 BBY, when Galen Marek, secret apprentice of Darth Vader, visited the planet of Nar Shaddaa to find Jedi Master Rahm Kota, the guardsman was sent with a task force to kill him. The apprentice got past all of his Imperial Navy commandos, and then engaged the guard in duel at the front of The Undertow, a bar that Kota was at, with the latter ambushing him with a Force Push, and first sent a wave of EVO Troopers to take on Marek. After a while, the guardsman summoned his Shadow Troopers to aid him. Even so, he was still overpowered by the apprentice; who used the Force to repel him out of the bar as the latter attempted to use a Force Grip on his foe, killing him.\nAs a Shadow Guard, he was proficient with a lightsaber pike, using it in the duel. The guardsmen also was able to use the Force to some extent, producing Force lightning and able to Force choke. In the end, his skills were no match for that of Marek's.\nThis Shadow Guard appears only in the Wii and PS2 versions for The Force Unleashed, largely because of Cloud City being replaced with Nar Shaddaa in those versions.",
