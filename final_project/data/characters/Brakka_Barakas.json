 "content": "Brakka Barakas was an elder of New Brigia. Brakka taken as a hostage by the Yevetha during the attack on the Brigian colony of New Brigia. Along with the other hostages taken during the Yevethan Purge, Brakka was forced to record a message begging the New Republic not to fire on Yevethan ships carrying prisoners. The Yevetha played the messages during the Battle of Doornik-319, causing hesitation from the New Republic ships and forcing them to withdraw. Later, Han Solo learned that he and all the other prisoners of the Yevetha had been freed by the Star Morning thanks to the Fallanassi Enara.",
