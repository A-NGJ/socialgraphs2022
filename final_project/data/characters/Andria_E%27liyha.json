 "content": "Andria E'liyha was a Human female criminal outcast who lived on Lok during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, she was planing to eliminate other criminals of the planet in order to become the leader of her own band of outcasts. In 1 ABY, she encountered a spacer in Nym's Stronghold and convinced that adventurer to attack the Blood Razor's camp and the Droid Engineer's Cave in order to, respectively, steal the treasures that were supposedly stocked by the pirates and remove insanity from Lok by killing the droid engineer. She hoped that the elimination of the \"opposition\" would help her in her project.\nAndria E'liyha was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Andria E'liyha was added to the game with the \"Publish 5\" update, released on December 16, 2003.",
