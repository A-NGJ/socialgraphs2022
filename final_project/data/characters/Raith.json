 "content": "Raith was a human male who served as a Raider stormtrooper in the First Order during their war against the Resistance, and held the rank of agent. During a mission to Ashas Ree, he and his squad were struck by an activated Sith relic during a scuffle with Mika Grey and a group from the Colossus. Raith and his squad tried to deactivate the sith artifact but the artifact released waves of energy powerful enough to subdue Raith and his Squad.\nRaith was voiced by Tom Taylorson in Star Wars Resistance.",
