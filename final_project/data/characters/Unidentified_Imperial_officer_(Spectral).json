 "content": "An human individual served as an Imperial officer aboard the Interdictor-class heavy cruiser Spectral, serving under Admiral Ektol Traz. After the Spectral retreated from the Battle of Fondor Shipyards to Jakku and dragged alongside it a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber from the New Republic's Shepherd Squadron, the officer was ordered to fire upon the snub-fighter by the admiral. The officer was hesitant as they were moving at lightspeed, and subsequently reported an issue with a gravity well projector and that they would need to shut down the entire vessel. When Admiral Traz asked when they would arrive to Jakku, the officer reported that they had just arrived.",
