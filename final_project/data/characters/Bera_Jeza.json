 "content": "Bera Jeza was a female Aqualish biologist who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Bera Jeza resided in Mos Eisley, on the planet Tatooine, where she had a job as lab assistant at the Mos Eisley Biolab. In the meantime, she was also secretly working for the Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and was involved in spice manufacturing.\nAt some point, her employer, the scientist Derg Prantis, obtained a sample of the dreadful Blackwing virus from an Imperial scientist. Prantis therefore built a secret laboratory on the remote planet Lok to conduct his own research on the virus in order to create a super soldier drug. The scientist recruited Bera Jeza to help him the project. However, Jeza soon betrayed her employer and contacted Jabba the Hutt to sell him the super soldier drug. In 1 ABY, Bera Jeza was about to meet Bib Fortuna, Jabba's majordomo, when she was assassinated in a street of Mos Eisley. Mos Eisley Police officer Happer was tasked to investigate the murder. In the meanwhile, Bib Fortuna hired a spacer to investigate whether Jeza's bargain with Jabba was related to the crime. The spacer would then discover the assassination of Derg Prantis, as well as the secret research project on Lok. The investigation eventually led to the discovery of a Blackwing virus outbreak on Dathomir.\nBera Jeza appeared as a dead non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Bera Jeza was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13,\" released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong,\" an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.",
