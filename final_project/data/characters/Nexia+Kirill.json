 "content": "Nexia Kirill was a female Human daughter of Harridax Kirill, a former pirate known as \"the Voidwolf\" who became the Grand Admiral of the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the Battle of Corellia in 3640 BBY the Voidwolf was killed by a smuggler working for the Galactic Republic, and Nexia swore to do whatever it took to hunt down and kill her father's murderer.\nNexia Kirill appears during \"The Nathema Conspiracy\" flashpoint only if the Commander is a smuggler who made the Light Side choice to pledge Voidwolf's pirate fleet to the Republic towards the end of their class story. In this case, Nexia Kirill will seek revenge on them and join the Order of Zildrog led by Vinn Atrius, only to be sacrificed as fuel to awaken Zildrog by GEMINI 16 on Nathema. If the smuggler makes a Dark Side choice to keep the fleet for themselves, Jedi Master Sumalee will appear instead of Nexia Kirill, while the other classes face antagonists from their own class stories.",
