 "content": "Vviir Wiamdi was a Gand ruetsavii. He, along with two other members, were sent to study the Gand pilot Ooryl Qrygg and see if he was worthy of being named janwuine. Not only did he watch Ooryl, but he joined the infamous starfighter squadron, Rogue Squadron, of which Qrygg was a member. He was very adept at piloting and even served as an undercover operative.",
