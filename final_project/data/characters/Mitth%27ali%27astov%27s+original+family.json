 "content": "A poor family was part of the Chiss Ascendancy, the nation of the Chiss species. Before becoming a member of the Mitth family, Caregiver Mitth'ali'astov, core name \"Thalias,\" was a member of the impoverished family, born on the planet Colonial Station Camco. However, she was taken from them as a child to become a sky-walker navigator.\nAround 19 BBY, the family suffered from a change in the price of certain minerals, which Mitth family Syndic Mitth'urf'ianico \"Thurfian\" informed Thalias of, adding that he could alleviate the family's troubles if Thalias gave him information on Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn.\" The caregiver stated that the Mitth were her people and did not give the syndic the information he desired.\nThe family was mentioned in the 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, the first installment of Timothy Zahn's The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
