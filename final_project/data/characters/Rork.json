 "content": "Rork was a Human male who served as a crewman on Captain Quasar's pleasure cruiser during the era of the Galactic Republic. Rork was aboard Quasar's cruiser during a journey through the Merson asteroid belt when they noticed Merson pirate vessels tailing their ship. Unschooled in the ways of war and not certain what to do, Quasar dispatched Rork to summon Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was traveling aboard the ship, as the captain wanted his counsel. Before long, the pirate ships attacked the pleasure cruiser, and Quasar turned over command of his ship to Kenobi. The Jedi then directed Rork on when to fire the cruiser's energy cannons in the ensuing battle, and his guidance proved instrumental to victory.\nRork made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Star Wars  24, written by Mary Jo Duffy and released in 1979. Rork was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
