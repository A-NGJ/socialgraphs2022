 "content": "A moisture farmer hoped to purchase some droids from a Jawa clan only to learn that they were not able to sell him any, as one of their number had destroyed the entire stock of droids.\nThis individual only appears in the story Oh!! Jawajawa, published in Star Wars Manga: Silver issue of Tokyopop's Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under the Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical.",
