 "content": "Wooro was an Aqualish male who worked in the Kendoh Gang alongside Kendoh Voss and the Clawdite Remex Io.\nDuring the mission to the moon of Avedot, he was shot in the shoulder by Resistance operative Finn, who used a harpoon gun.\nWooro and the rest of the Kendoh Gang then traveled to Batuu, hoping to steal the hilt of the Sword of Khashyun from Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities. When Voss met with Hondo Ohnaka at Oga's Cantina, Wooro waited at the bar with Io, unaware that his companion was actually Varg, a fellow Clawdite working as Dok-Ondar's enforcer. When Voss finally decided to move in to steal the hilt, Wooro accompanied her and took out one of Dok-Ondar's security droids before the First Order intervened and captured them and Dok-Ondar, believing them to be in league with the Resistance. Wooro was hit with a Z6 riot control baton by a stormtrooper as a they attempted to make Voss reveal her intentions on Batuu. Eventually, Voss improvised and grabbed the hilt, passing it off to Wooro. He fled the store and handed it off to Io, unaware he was returning the hilt to Dok-Ondar by passing it to Varg. As Wooro circled back to the ship, he found Io and realized what had happened. The group later learned that Dok-Ondar had hired them, tricking them into bringing him the sword and helped them escape the First Order.",
