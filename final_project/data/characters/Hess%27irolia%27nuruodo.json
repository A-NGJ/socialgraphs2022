 "content": "Commander Hess'irolia'nuruodo, also known by her core name Irolia, was a Chiss military officer.\nIn 28 ABY, Irolia was in command of the Chiss frigate that intercepted the Jade Shadow during its mission to the Unknown Regions, and escorted it to Csilla. To the eyes of Luke Skywalker, she seemed no older than his niece Jaina, then twenty years oldâ€”she may even have been younger.\nIrolia claimed to be an officer of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, but instead of the predominantly black jumpsuits of most CEDF officers, she wore a burgundy uniform with black flashes, a color-scheme previously only seen among troops from Grand Admiral Thrawn's rogue Household Phalanx. Also, her ship was escorted by Nssis-class Clawcraft, hybrid TIE-series starfighters that had previously only been seen in combat with House Phalanx forces.",
