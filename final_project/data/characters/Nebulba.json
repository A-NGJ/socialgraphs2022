 "content": "Nebulba was a male Dug and a member of the famous Sebulba family, and The Sebolto Clan of Malastare. He had a bounty posted on his head around 32 BBY, which had been specifically ordered by a hateful rival of his podracing relative, the Gran Mawhonic. The bounty was eventually collected by the bounty hunter Jango Fett.\nThe bounty was worth 3000 credits for a live capture, but was reduced to 1500 credits for being taken dead.",
