 "content": "Rax Joris was a corrupt Imperial Army officer who was the head of a prison compound on Dosuun after the Battle of Endor. Occasionally, when boredom struck, he would let his prisoners loose and see if they could escape his clutches. They never did, as his skill with a concussion rifle was too great.\nIn 14 ABY, he had camouflaged Imperial Saboteurs capture Jaden Korr, who was on a mission on Dosuun, and after allowing Korr to escape from his cell, decided to play his \"game\" with Korr. He taunted and shot at the Jedi from safe locations within the compound grounds, before holing up in the hangar, after becoming worried about the Jedi's progress through the facility. Realizing that Korr would eventually find him, he took up his rifle and waited on the top level of the hangar, confident that he would be safe and that he could blast the Jedi.\nWhen Korr entered the hangar bay, Joris shot at him with his concussion rifle, but Korr dodged the weapon's shots effortlessly and worked his way up to the top where Rax stood. He defeated the Imperial and reclaimed his stolen lightsaber.\nJoris's voice was provided by Gregg Berger for the Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy game.\nRax Joris can also be killed by ranged weapons, such as a disruptor rifle, from the very lowest floors of the hangar bay, without even climbing to the top.",
