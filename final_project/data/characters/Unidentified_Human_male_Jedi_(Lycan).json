 "content": "A male Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic during the wanning years of the Republic Classic era, this man was escorting the dangerous former Jedi Lycan back to Coruscant when his ship crashed.\nThis individual was a Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. Serving the Jedi High Council, this Jedi was dispatched to a distant prison world six months following the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. His mission was to escort the former Jedi Master turned Dark Jedi, Lycan, back to Coruscant to be tried by the High Council. When Lycan was safely stowed aboard his shuttle, the Jedi began his trek back to the Temple when the Dark Jedi attempted to seize control of the cockpit. During the confrontation, the Jedi Knight lost control and the ship plunged down the gravity well of a rural planet, crashing on the property of farmer Darca Nyl. When Nyl rushed to investigate, the wounded Jedi crawled from the wreckage and handed the former mercenary his weapon, warning him of the danger Lycan posed. His warning given, the Jedi died amongst the burning wreckage of his ship. Wielding the Jedi's lightsaber, Nyl rushed back to his home to find his son, Neas, murdered by the Dark Jedi. Enraged, Nyl began a journey of revenge, seeking justice for his slain son, and eventually killed Lycan on the planet Molavar.",
