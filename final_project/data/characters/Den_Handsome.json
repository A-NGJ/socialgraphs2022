 "content": "The individual known as Den Handsome was a human male who was one of the galaxy's most prolific liars and accomplished thieves. It is not known whether he used his real name, or if Den Handsome was actually an alias. Either way, Handsome was known to claim that he stole Commander Bragh's Purge Trooper armor, and the set that Bragh wore in combat was actually his backup set.\nHandsome was created by Kabam for Star Wars: Uprising, a canon mobile video game for iOS and Android operating systems and released in 2015. The player could send Handsome on crew run missions in order to collect useful items.",
