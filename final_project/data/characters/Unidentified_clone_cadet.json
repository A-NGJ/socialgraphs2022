 "content": "This clone was a cadet and participated in the Battle of Kamino. During the assault on Tipoca City, this cadet and four other members of his squad got separated from the main group of clones. The cadets stumbled across clone troopers Echo and Fives, who were sniping at the advancing Separatist aqua droids, and 99, who was resupplying the two troopers. When the cadet and his companions explained their situation, Echo, Fives, and 99 left their position and brought them to safety inside the barracks.\nThey were later joined by Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex. As the battle droids continued to advance, they prepared to fight, with the cadets growing nervous at the prospect of facing live combat despite not having finished their training. Fives and Echo succeed in raising the morale of the young cadets, and 99 showed them the way to a nearby armory, where the group grabbed several DC-15A blaster carbines for the cadets as well as grenades. The cadets were stationed inside the beds that retracted into the wall, and when a platoon of B1-series battle droids attacked them, they launched a surprise attack from above. The cadet survived the battle but witnessed the tragic death of 99.",
