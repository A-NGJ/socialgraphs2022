 "content": "Rej Taunt was a male Askajian crime boss who lived on Nar Shaddaa. As the eldest son of a family of Tomuon cloth traders, he was inherently wealthy. Rej was a previous owner of the rebuilt YT-1300 light freighter that came to be known as the Millennium Falcon; under his command, the YT-1300 was known as the Second Chance.\nWhile Taunt was on a job from a Black Sun Vigo to pick up an order of buzz droids, the unsecured droids managed to activate and start dismantling the Second Chance from the inside out. The buzz droids were successfully jettisoned from the ship. However, an Acclamator-class assault ship accompanied by a Destroyer approached the YT-1300 to do a search. The Imperial Acclamator flew through the swarm of buzz droids, which then dismantled the ship.\nA little more than 60 years later, Rej was visited by Tobb Jadak and Flitcher Poste while incarcerated on Carcel.",
