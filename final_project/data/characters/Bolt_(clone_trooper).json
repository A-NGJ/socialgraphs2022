 "content": "\"Bolt\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served the Galactic Republic as a sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nBolt served as part of an escort for the Republic medical frigate Medica. However, the frigate was attacked by the Separatists, leaving only Bolt uninjured. The Medica later picked up the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi from an asteroid where he was stranded. Whilst the Jedi was on board, the ship was attacked by wounded Zygerrian deserters, who attempt to steal the ship's supply of bacta. Bolt and Kenobi defended the ship against the deserters with the help from a wounded clone trooper, before arresting the Zygerrians and treating their wounds on the way to confinement.",
