 "content": "Rikarda was a human female who worked as a freighter captain during the reign of the Galactic Empire, piloting the light freighter Stellar Sun. In 4 BBY, she agreed to transport the gambler Lando Calrissian to the planet Klonoid, where he would retrieve droid parts. En route to Klonoid, however, Calrissian learned that his precious puffer pig had been stolen by the Varluk Organization and taken to the planet Zyzar. Although it meant a significant detour, Rikarda agreed to take her passenger there after he promised to make it worth her while. When it turned out that her client's recovery mission had turned awry, Rikarda picked him and his pig up, helping them escape a firefight.\nRikarda was a fair-skinned woman with amber eyes. Lando Calrissian described her as a beauty, and she accepted his compliments.",
