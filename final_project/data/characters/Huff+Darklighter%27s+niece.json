 "content": "A Human female was the niece of Huff Darklighter. She lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Huff Darklighter's niece resided at the Darklighter estate, on the planet Tatooine. During that time, Jabba the Hutt began to capture people on Tatooine in order to sell them as slaves. In 1 ABY, Huff Darklighter's niece was among a group of people kidnapped by Jabba's thugs. However, she quickly managed to escape with others and called her uncle for help with her comlink. Huff Darklighter soon dispatched a spacer to rescue the woman before Jabba's henchmen tracking her showed up. The spacer found the woman lost in the desert and escorted her back safely to the Darklighter estate. The woman was really shocked by this experience but she was able to explain the whole story to her uncle. Huff Darklighter later paid the spacer to eliminate the criminal leading Jabba's slaving ring.\nHuff Darklighter's niece was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Huff Darklighter's niece was present in the original release of the game, being part of the first version of the Darklighter's Estate questline. With the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005, the Darklighter's Estate questline was deeply revamped and Huff Darklighter's niece was removed from the game.\nIn the game, the woman was only identified as \"Huff's Niece\" and did not have a proper name. The only identified nieces of Huff Darklighter were the two younger sisters of Gavin Darklighter. However, as they were still children at the time of the Battle of Yavin, Huff's niece from Star Wars Galaxies should be another Darklighter.",
