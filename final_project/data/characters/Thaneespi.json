 "content": "Thaneespi was a Mon Calamari who served in the fleet of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 4 ABY, Thaneespi was first officer of the MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser Home One while present at a briefing shortly before the Battle of Endor. Prior to the meeting, where the Alliance's strategy at the Forest Moon of Endor was discussed, Thaneespi briefly spoke with Admiral Gial Ackbar.\nHome One then traveled to Endor, where Thaneespi served as one of the commanders of the Alliance's Star Cruiser at the battle there. The battle resulted in the destruction of the Galactic Empire's second Death Star and the death of Emperor Palpatine. Thaneespi had brown-mottled skin, yellow eyes, and wore a helmet along with a beige uniform.\nThaneespi first appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, and was first identified in the new Star Wars canon in the twenty-fourth issue of De Agostini's Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon magazine series, around June 17, 2015. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Thaneespi's name was first revealed in the Death Star II Limited expansion set for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in 2000.\nThe scenes on Home One were filmed throughout the week of Tuesday, February 16, 1982. The helmet worn by Thaneespi was originally intended to be worn by Admiral Ackbar, but it was given to Thaneespi as Ackbar's articulated head would have made wearing the helmet complicated. The team of Pete Ronzani was responsible for the helmet's design.",
