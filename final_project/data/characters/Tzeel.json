 "content": "Tzeel was a female Human who was a member of the band Distraction, serving as the band's percussionist. She traveled to the Hutt yacht after the band was hired to perform aboard the ship.\nTzeel wore white-colored make-up on her face, which glowed when lights were shined onto her during the band's concerts. She liked the effect a lot, so she wore the make-up all of the time, never removing it. She spoke using jerky words and frequently made hand gestures.",
