 "content": "Mtara Vinram was a Human female who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. She was a member of the Corellian Security Force before choosing to become a criminal.\nMtara Vinram was once an officer of the Corellian Security Force. However, by the time following the Battle of Yavin, she was part of the group of CorSec troopers and agents who left CorSec in pursuit of a more criminal lifestyle. Along with Hiram Bish, Mtara Vinram became one of the commanders of the Rogue CorSec. In 1 ABY, Bish and Vinram elaborated a plot to discredit the Diktat, Daclif Gallamby, and his government. As part of the plot, they created evidences that the Diktat himself was smuggling illegal spice in the Coronet Capitol. The plot was finally foiled by a spacer recruited by CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper. The spacer infiltrated the Rogue CorSec Base to find proof of the Diktat's innocence. Mtara Vinram and Hiram Bish were killed during the assault.\nMtara Vinram appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nMtara Vinram was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. She was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27,\" on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest,\" the main questline in the game.",
