 "content": "Winloss was a hunter and the husband of Nokk.\nWinloss and his wife, Nokk were employed by Doctor Aphra, who contacted the hunters by hologram. She led Winloss and Nokk through deadly traps under the illusion they needed to capture a beast for her boss. Aphra's true goal was to escape from the stomach of the Shadowfang Beast before it digested her.\nBeing employed by Cornelius Evazan in disguise as Princess Leia Organa, Winloss and Nokk went to Milvayne to kill Aphra and incapacitate Triple-Zero.\nWhen Aphra, Triple-Zero, and Vulaada Klam, who had been attacked by a revived Tam Posla while riding on the qaberworm Gurtyl, Winloss and Nokk arrived, striking a harpoon through Posla, and incapacitating the rebuilt BT-1. Aphra and Triple-Zero managed to escape from the hunters, who took BT-1 with them and continued their hunt.\nSome time later, after Aphra repaired Triple-Zero, the hunters attempted to capture their targets, sending Nokk on a chase through the Milvayne traffic. As part of the plan, Nokk was seemingly shot down by BT-1, leading both Triple-Zero and Aphra into a trap when they attempted to reach the astromech droid. After being shot down by the Coalition for Progress, the hunters' starship began to fall to the surface, and Winloss and Nokk ejected, escaping the crash.\nAfter the ship had crashed, Aphra interrogated by Captain Okma of the Coalition for Progress, who was later killed by Triple-Zero. Some time afterward, Winloss and Nokk returned to Aphra, preparing to kill her, but chose to leave her alive, stating that they hunted better prey.\nLater, Winloss and Nokk tracked down Evazan and his associate Ponda Baba with the help of Professor Prexo. They deactivated the proximity bombs in Aphra and Triple-Zero, as well as the technology Evazan had used to broadcast the events to the whole planet.",
