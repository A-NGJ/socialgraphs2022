 "content": "A Human male worked as a Sith diplomat on the planet Manaan during the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY. The diplomat represented a group of Sith soldiers in the Ahto High Court during a hearing that was the result of a brawl between his clients and a group of Republic soldiers. Both sides were found to be at fault and were fined by the Ahto City Civil Authority. Revan, a Jedi Padawan, witnessed the hearing while he was visiting the planet.\nA Human male Sith diplomat was stationed on the water-covered planet Manaan during the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY. He was the representative of a group of Sith soldiers during a hearing in the Ahto High Court that was the result of a brawl between his clients and a group of Republic soldiers. The neutrality laws of Manaan meant that open aggression between the warring sides was illegal on the planet, and so they were brought to trial for the incident. As the diplomat argued that his soldiers should not be punished for winning a fair fight, Revan, a Padawan of the Jedi Order, entered the court and witnessed the hearing. The Republic representative rebuked this claim, stating six against three was hardly a fair fight. The Republic agent informed the court that his men had been goaded into the fight, but the judges decreed that words were not sufficient provocation, and the Ahto City Civil Authority fined both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic 10,000 credits for the incident.\nRevan spoke with the diplomat at the conclusion of the trial, after which the diplomat complained about the treatment of the Sith on Manaan.\nThe diplomat believed that Sith victory in the war was inevitable and that Manaan's native sentient species, the Selkath, should abandon their neutrality and align with the Sith, or they might be forced to do so in the future. He also believed that the Selkath, while claiming neutrality on the surface, were actually biased against the Sith. He was completely and utterly loyal to Darth Malak's Sith Empire.\nThe Sith diplomat appears in the Xbox and PC RPG video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2003, when the player visits Manaan and enters the Selkath courtroom in Ahto City for the first time. It is possible to speak to him after the scene has concluded, during which he spouts several pro-Sith phrases to the player, like the quotes presented in this article. It is also possible for the player to never encounter this character, as there is no required reason to enter the courtroom before the raid on the Sith Embassy.\nThis diplomat and Grann have the same character model in the video game, as well as both being voiced by the same voice actor, Cam Clarke. They are both given the generic name of \"Sith Diplomat\" as well; however, they are separate characters.",
