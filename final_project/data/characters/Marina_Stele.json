 "content": "Marina Stele was the wife of Kerek Stele and mother of Maarek Stele.\nMarina Stele's husband was a famous scientist who was abducted by the Bordali during their war with Kuan, in the hopes of making him serve them. When he proved uncooperative, they decided to abduct his family, too, in order to persuade him. Marina and Maarek fought their attackers but were both captured and taken to a shuttle for transport to Bordal.\nDuring the flight, the ship was captured by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vengeance, which was taking part in the Empire's invasion of the Taroon system. After some time spent as prisoners on the Vengeance, Maarek agreed to serve aboard the ship, while Marina returned to Kuan to help with the transition to Imperial control and continue the search for her husband.",
