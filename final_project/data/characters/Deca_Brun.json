 "content": "Deca Brun ran for governor in the Galacian Gubernatorial election in 44 BBY. He received widespread support, as he promised reform and prosperity. However, Brun had made a deal with Offworld Mining Corporation, promising them exclusive mining rights which would have caused extensive environmental damage in exchange for campaign funding. Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered this deal, and this was revealed before the election. Thus Wila Prammi, another candidate, won the election by a vast majority.",
