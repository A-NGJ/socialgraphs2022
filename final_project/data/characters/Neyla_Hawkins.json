 "content": "Neyla Hawkins was a Human female living during the Cold War. A sister of Mia Hawkins, both were members of the Eagle's network, which in truth was the proxy of the Sith Lord Darth Jadus.\nIn 3643 BBY Mia deserted from the Ghost cell section of the organization and contacted the Imperial Intelligence to save her life. She helped Imperial Agent Cipher Nine in bringing the Ghost Cell down, with Nine later murdering the Eagle himself. His organization destroyed, the Empire began systematically hunting down the remaining terrorists. Neyla found her refuge from the Empire in joining the Galactic Republic's Republic Strategic Information Service. During the Battle of Corellia in 3640 BBY, she tracked down Cipher Nine with a tip from Hunter and cornered them in the Coronet City's Military History Museum. She had the Cipher disarmed and on their knees at gunpoint, but the Agent managed to fight back and kill her.",
