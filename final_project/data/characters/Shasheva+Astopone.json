 "content": "Shasheva Astopone was a wealthy, dark-haired Human female, well respected among high society. The Astopone family became prosperous in the export business, and Shasheva was the heir to the family fortune. She was a patron of the arts, an exotic beauty, and a secret agent of the Rebel Alliance.\nShe was recruited by Bail Organa and used her considerable wealth to fund Rebel spying and smuggling operations on Coruscant. More daringly, she used her position to attend and arrange dinners and glamorous balls with Imperial Moffs and admirals, discreetly probing for sensitive information. Her method for sharing this information was to store it on a datadot hidden in her firegem ring, then hand it to a Rebel contact. She often met her contacts at the Coruscant Opera House, for which she had a private box.",
