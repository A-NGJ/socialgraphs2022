 "content": "Teilo Monnro was a Zabrak businesswoman who lived on Corellia at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin, Teilo Monnro ran a shop in the city of Tyrena. In 1 ABY, she had trouble with a local member of the technology-hating Meatlump gang. The Meatlump Hrath Koo repeatedly came into her shop and smashed whatever she was working on. After several of these incidents, Monnro was fed up. She tracked Koo to a cave near Tyrena that the Meatlumps used as their base of operations. She couldn't attack the Meatlumps on her own, but she was lucky and met an adventurer who was working as an independent agent for CorSec. The adventurer was investigating a Meatlump attack on the starship captain Osto Grissom and agreed to help her with her problem. When the adventurer emerged from the cave again, Monnro was reliefed to learn, that Koo would no longer bother her.\nTeilo Monnro was a Non-Player Character  in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Teilo Monnro was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006. She could be found outside of the Meatlump Cave near Tyrena on Corellia and offered a small optional quest. During the quest \"CorSec Case Files: Assault and Battery\", which was a part of the Legacy quest, the longest quest line of the game, the player had to enter the cave and fight the Meatlumps. Monnro's quest asked the player to kill the Meatlump Hrath Koo inside the cave.",
