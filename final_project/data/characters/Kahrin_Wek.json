 "content": "Kahrin Wek was a female Rutian Twi'lek who served in the Republic Military during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. The quartermaster of Waypoint Station Draay on the ruined planet of Taris, she proved her superior Commander Gardit's corruption with the help of a Republic-allied individual.\nA female Rutian Twi'lek, Kahrin Wek joined the Republic Military sometime before 3643 BBY. She served on the ruined planet of Taris during the later stages of the Cold War with the Sith Empire, where she was stationed at Waypoint Station Draay.\nWek served as quartermaster under Commander Gardit, the base's commanding officer. In that role, she ensured that the Republic's forward bases, like Waypoint Station Morne and Lytle Research Outpost, received the necessary supplies. However, Wek suspected her superior to be corrupt—the human used his position to ensure good rations and benefits for himself, while the rest of the base was forced to survive on meager supplies. When one of the base's supply ships was set to leave for the nearest supply depot, Wek noticed that one of the ship's engines was damaged. Gardit, however, dismissed her concerns and allowed the ship to leave. The ship had barely lifted off when it crashed in a nearby swamp infested with bogstalkers.\nWhen Gardit asked a Republic-allied individual to help recover the supplies from the downed craft, he sent them to Wek for the location of the crash. Informing the individual of her suspicions of Gardit, the Twi'lek convinced the individual to help expose her superior. She gave the individual a holocamera along with the ship's location, telling them to record the damaged engine as evidence.\nThe individual succeeded, recovering all of the supplies that remained, and returned to Wek with the evidence she needed. She and the individual then confronted Gardit, who shamefacedly told the pair that he had not realized the ship was that badly damaged—he thought it could make it to the nearest refueling station. Regardless, Wek planned to court-martial the commander, and thanked the individual for the help.\nShe also asked them to investigate the fates of the supply convoy that the base had sent to Waypoint Station Morne a week ago. The convoy's crew had not reported anything, and Morne had not received the supplies. She told the individual how to repair the sonic emitters along the trail, which would drive off much of the aggressive wildlife, and gave them the last known location of the convoy. The individual would eventually find the convoy, who had decided to desert, and aided them in getting off-planet.\nKahrin Wek was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears first as part of the Republic Taris mission \"Supplies and Demands,\" but can also give the bonus mission \"Prove Gardit's Corruption.\" Both missions, as they appear on the Republic version of the planet, are restricted to Republic players, but players do have alignment options. Players can gather the evidence for Wek and complete \"Prove Gardit's Corruption,\" and they can choose whether or not to give the recording to Wek. Giving her the recording and supporting her against Gardit results in light-side points, while siding with Gardit results in dark side points.\nWek also starts the mission \"AWOL\" after the completion of \"Supplies and Demands,\" where she asks Republic players to search for the missing convoy. This quest ends with Commander Yajak in Waypoint Station Morne.",
