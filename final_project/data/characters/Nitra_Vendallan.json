 "content": "Nitra Vendallan was a Human female captain of the Rebel Alliance who operated out of the town of Anchorhead on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Captain Nitra Vendallan of the Rebel Alliance was stationed in the Anchorhead tavern on Tatooine. While there, she learned of an Imperial Army non-com named Drenn Biktor who wished to defect to the Alliance. He knew a great deal about Imperial Outer Rim supply routes, which could be useful for the Rebels in interdicting their shipments. Eager to bring Biktor safely to Anchorhead before he could be found by the Empire, Vendallan asked a Rebel spacer to escort him.\nThe spacer succeeded in finding Biktor and bringing him back safely to Anchorhead. After returning Biktor, Vendallan made arrangements to get him offworld. However, Vendallan's work did not end there. A friend of hers, named Vil Sembian, son of a famous, deceased weaponsmith named Daw Sembian, possessed a schematic for a new type of blaster. Vil was bringing the schematic to Vendallan, but the Empire was on his tail. Vendallan's commander claimed that the weapon could tip the scales in their favor, so she tasked the same spacer who had helped her earlier with finding and escorting Vil Sembian safely. The Rebel spacer agreed, and succeeded in the mission. Vendallan was pleased, and stated that she would send the schematics to Alliance High Command.\nNitra Vendallan was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for Vendallan in Anchorhead had to hunt down and escort Drenn Biktor and Vil Sembian back to town. Although the player could choose not to do Nitra Vendallan's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.",
