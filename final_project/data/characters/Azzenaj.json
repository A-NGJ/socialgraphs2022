 "content": "Azzenaj was an Arch Witch of the Singing Mountain Clan on the planet Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War. Her pet rancor was named Lurrexu.\nShe once sent out an individual to find her initiate who had gone to collect herbs and never came back. She pointed the individual towards the Nightspider Cult cave. At some point Azzenaj's old rival, the Nightsister Nandina, had escaped from the Chamber of Banishment and, hungering for revenge, decided to settle her score with the Arch Witch. She hired an assassin to take care of Azzenaj and provided him with the proper instructions. The assassin made his move, and the Arch Witch met him with the full arsenal of her Force powers. However, the assassin possessed several lethal weapons, and Azzenaj used the Force to mask her life signs. The assassin, believing her dead, took her elaborate jewelry as the proof of his job done and left to report to Nandina.\nAzzenaj was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Azzenaj was added to the game with the \"Publish 1\" update, released on August 3, 2003. Upon the release of the \"Game Update 19\" on December 14, 2010, she was included in the so-called \"Witches of Dathomir Theme Park\".",
