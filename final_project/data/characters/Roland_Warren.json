 "content": "Roland Warren was an agent of the Rebel Alliance. Warren was the son of Morellian scoutmaster Barosa Warren and an unidentified mother. He was on bad terms with his father, especially since Roland joined the Rebel Alliance, opposing Barosa's wishes.\nRoland Warren's siblings were Tole Warren, Alton Lochner, and Danlea Lochner . All of them were half-Morellian and probably came from different mothers, and all of them joined the Rebel Alliance. As of 2 ABY, Roland Warren was an undercover contact for the Rebel Alliance in the Simik system.",
