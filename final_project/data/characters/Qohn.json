 "content": "Qohn was a male Nazzar who at 3963 BBY was a slave to the Sungrazer cooperative, an organization that used slaves for deadly risky comet mining. Qohn managed to survive five dives, which was a record as none have survived more. When Zayne Carrick and Jarael tried to free the slaves from the Sungrazer, Qohn was among them, but was caught by a Skyreaper drone from the Gladiator.",
