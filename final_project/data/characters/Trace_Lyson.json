 "content": "Trace Lyson was a Human male journalist who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Lyson resided in the city of Mos Espa. During that time, Tusken Raiders in the region of Mos Eisley had become very hostile and directly threatened the city. In 1 ABY, one of Trace Lyson's associates by the name Trehla Keelo discovered information regarding the recent activities of Tusken near Mos Eisley. After a skirmish with the Tuskens in Junktown, she dispatched a spacer to travel from Mos Eisley to Mos Espa in order to inform Trace Lyson about the situation.\nTrace Lyson was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nTrace Lyson was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. He was part of an introductory questline for new players who spawned on Tatooine right after the completion of the \"New Player Tutorial\". Trace Lyson's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
