 "content": "Tiom Rordan was a Human male who served as a starfighter pilot in the Galactic Alliance during the Second Galactic Civil War. Stationed aboard the frigate Mawrunner, he began dating Syal Antilles, to the tacit disapproval of her father, Wedge Antilles. After less than a year of dating, they decided to be married after the end of the war. However, when the Galactic Alliance Second Fleet, including Mawrunner, was ordered to accompany the Galactic Alliance Chief of State to negotiations with the Confederation, the Confederation activated the Centerpoint Station superweapon, obliterating the Second Fleet and killing Rordan. His fianc√© was devastated following his death, which also cost her the rest of her squadron.\nTiom Rordan has appeared in two Star Wars works thus far in the form of two Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novels, Legacy of the Force: Exile and Legacy of the Force: Fury, both written by Aaron Allston. His name was not revealed until Fury, and he never made a direct appearance, being only mentioned in both cases.",
