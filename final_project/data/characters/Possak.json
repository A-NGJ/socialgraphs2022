 "content": "Possak was a Trandoshan who joined the Warstalkers, a former mercenary group of Trandoshans that was led by Qyzen Fess during the era in which the Eternal Empire controlled the galaxy. In his efforts to teach his students about the Trandoshan goddess Scorekeeper and the glory of the hunt, Qyzen brought Possak and other Warstalkers to the planet Hoth to hunt beasts worthy of rewarding jagannath points. Possak scouted the Starship Graveyard and reported the presence of several worthy beasts, but went missing shortly afterward.",
