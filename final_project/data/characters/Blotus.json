 "content": "Blotus was a Hutt male who served as the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic for a 275-year term during the Rianitus Period, an era that lasted from 9000 to 8000 BBY. Formerly an administrator of several mining planets that had separated from the Hutt Empire, Blotus joined the Republic and quickly became a popular figure within its Senate. As Chancellor, he overcame the stereotypes assigned to members of his species and ushered in a new age of prosperity for the Republic. After his death, Blotus was remembered as one of the most prominent beings to serve as Supreme Chancellor in galactic history.\nBlotus the Hutt lived during the Rianitus Period, an era of time that spanned from 9000 to 8000 BBY. He served as administrator of a string of mining worlds that had broken away from what remained of the Hutt Empire and applied for membership in the Galactic Republic, the dominant government in the galaxy. Though tensions existed between the Republic and the Hutt species, Blotus and his planets were accepted into the government's fold, and the Hutt became a popular being within the Galactic Senate.\nSome time later, Blotus became Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, having been elected to the position by a substantial majority. Blotus's ascension to the office marked the apex of millennia of Hutt immigration to the Republic; in becoming the first Hutt Supreme Chancellor, Blotus had dispelled the fixed stereotypes assigned to the Hutt species. Under his reign as Chancellor, the Republic benefited from a period of prosperity. When Blotus granted tax breaks to independent merchants, trade prospered within the Core Worlds, and the Republic capital of Coruscant specifically enjoyed substantial economic growth.\nThe Hutt's term as the leader of the galactic government lasted for 275 years, after which Blotus died at the age of 912, peacefully passing away in his sleep. By the time of the Cold War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, Blotus's Chancellorship was remembered with affection, so much that the Hutt's favorite seat in the lounge of the Senate Building was purposely left vacant. Later generations regarded Blotus the Hutt as one of the most illustrious figures to serve as Chancellor in the history of the Republic, a claim supported by historian and author Voren Na'al in 36 ABY.\nA male Hutt, Blotus was a former administrator of multiple worlds, and was regarded as a competent individual. Blotus overcame the long-established stereotypes associated with Hutts to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor, and, centuries after his death, he was remembered as one of the most renowned beings in galactic history to hold the office of Chancellor.\nBlotus the Hutt was first mentioned in The New Essential Chronology, a second-generation Essential Guide written by Daniel Wallace and Kevin J. Anderson and published on October 25, 2005. Though Blotus did not appear in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, he was given an entry in the game's Codex databank, which provided new information.",
