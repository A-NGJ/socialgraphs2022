 "content": "Silas Draver was a competitor in the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament on the planet Bespin in about 17 BBY. Draver did not make it to the competition's final round and during the award ceremony at the tournament's conclusion, Draver attempted to steal access codes of the bank account holding the total winnings, taking fellow competitor Mirana Fioro as a hostage. Draver's stunt was thwarted by covert members of the Alderaanian Resistance, along with venue security.",
