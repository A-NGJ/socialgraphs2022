 "content": "Morgan Q. Raventhorn was a Human female who served as major in the Rebel SpecForces during the Galactic Civil War. A tall dark-haired and blue-eyed woman, she was killed in the Battle of Endor.\nMorgan was the younger sister of Rebel commando Jai Raventhorn.\nRaventhorn was born into a family of scouts. At a young age, she learned about surveying planets and wilderness survival. She also proved to a savant with technology as by age ten she was able to disassemble hyperdrive components from her father's ship and put them back together in ninety minutes. After leaving the scout service, she ended up on Rodaj as a miner where she met T'Charek Haathi and Ivhin Jayme. They persuaded her to join the Rebel Alliance with them. She had a hard time adapting to military life, often disregarding orders to follow her instincts.\nOn Zelos II with the rest of her team, she assisted with the plan of stealing a light freighter named The Maker. She climbed a lighting tower and spliced her datapad into the security camera feed. This allowed her to show a computer image of the docking bay and freighter instead of a live feed. Haathi complemented her on the forgery, but Raventhorn continued to brag about the details she had included in the video. Haathi ordered her to continue with the mission, so the tech connected a Scomp-Spiker to the security system and waited for the signal to activate it. Jayme contacted her and told her he was ready and asked if she was a safe distance from the power box. He reminded her of a past incident where she blew the thumb off her hand and had to have medical personnel re-attach it. Once Jayme got into position, she blew the device, which caused a power surge through the main computer system. This caused the force field and power fence to deactivate so Jayme could pole-vault into the docking bay safely.\nShe joined the rest of the team in the docking bay and was commanded by Haathi to deactivate the freighter's defenses so they could board and steal it. Raventhorn was able to deactivate all the defenses but the stun steps and Haathi was shocked trying to enter the freighter. The tech drug her commander under the freighter and checked on her condition while the starport security opened fire on the team. While Haathi recovered from the shock, Raventhorn went back to work on disabling the stun steps. As she was doing this, she was confronted by a security guard. Thinking quickly, she tossed the power cables at him, shocking him. She then proceeded to connect the cables to the ladder leading into the docking back, which knocked out the remaining guards. The team boarded the freighter and discovered the owner, Sythluss Leethe, had installed a bulkhead door preventing access to the cockpit. While she pondered on a way to open the door, Jayme blew it open with explosives. She entered the cockpit and waved at the security guards as Haathi flew the ship away.\nRaventhorn was extremely intelligent, but had a tendency to become confused by matters that didn't deal with technology or wilderness survival. She had designed several jury-rigged inventions that went on to become standard issue for Special Ops personnel.",
