 "content": "Captain Piard was a Human male who served in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War. In 137 ABY, Piard's shipping vessel was boarded in the Arkanis sector by Black Sun pirates who demanded his shipment of blasters. Piard and the Imperial officer Guerno were rescued by the former Jedi Cade Skywalker, who used a mind trick to convince them that Black Sun pirates stole the cargo. Skywalker and his companions then took the shipment of blasters for themselves.\nPiard was a Human male who served as a captain in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in 137 ABY, during the Second Imperial Civil War, a galactic conflict between Krayt's Empire and deposed Emperor Roan Fel's Empire-in-exile. At some point during his career, Piard encountered a Jedi, whom he believed to be the galaxy's champions. The Captain and the Imperial officer Guerno were assigned to a shipping vessel that was delivering cargo, which included Thunderbolt Mark 7 blasters, via the Triellus Trade Route.\nPiard's ship stopped at the 5709-DC Shipping Lane, a hyperspace route in the Arkanis sector, and was boarded by pirates affiliated with the Black Sun crime syndicate. The pirates' captain, Dovrin, threatened Piard and Guerno, demanding to know where the blasters were. Piard objected when the Cathar pirate destroyed a protocol droid. Dovrin was interrupted when he heard a noise nearby and sent his cronies to check on it. Shortly after, the former Jedi Cade Skywalker and his companions, Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue, revealed themselves after boarding the vessel and rescued Piard and Guerno by killing Dovrin and incapacitating the remaining pirates.\nPiard immediately thanked Skywalker for his assistance, believing he was a Jedi. When Skywalker demanded the shipment of Thunderbolt blasters, Piard began to object but was influenced by a mind trick from Skywalker, who used the Force to persuade the Captain and Guerno to forget the encounter and believe that Black Sun took his cargo. Skywalker and his companions then took Piard's cargo.\nPiard was light-skinned and had white hair and blue eyes. As a captain in the Imperial Navy, he wore an Imperial officer's uniform. Piard revered the Jedi as \"champions of the galaxy,\" and knew that the Jedi would eventually return to galactic affairs. Piard objected when Dovrin destroyed the protocol droid and was extremely thankful when Cade Skywalker rescued him and Guerno from the Black Sun pirates. He initially objected when Skywalker informed him he was taking the shipment of Thunderbolt blasters but was influenced by Skywalker's abilities with the mind trick.\nPiard appeared in the thirty-seventh issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy, written by John Ostrander. He was penciled by Jan Duursema.",
