Thirty-three years prior to the near destruction of the moon Cynda, she gave Myder a blaster, although her daughter had no reason to use the blaster until over three decades after it was given to her.\nZaluna Myder's mother was first mentioned, but not named, in A New Dawn, a novel written by John Jackson Miller and released in September 2014.",
