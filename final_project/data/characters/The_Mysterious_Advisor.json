 "content": "The Mysterious Advisor was the title used by a female human who resided in the Anoat sector of the galaxy. She had a diplomatic background, preferring defense over offense, and at the time of the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade, the advisor joined the crew of a young smuggler. She refused to wield a blaster, although she carried a sword.\nThe Mysterious Advisor was created for the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was created by Kabam for iOS and Android operating systems. In Star Wars: Uprising, the Mysterious Advisor is a Tier II Crew Member available through the Premium Crane, Daily Opportunities, or other Missions.",
