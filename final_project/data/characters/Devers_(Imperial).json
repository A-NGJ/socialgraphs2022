 "content": "Devers was a human male Imperial Army trooper stationed at Eiattu 6 during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Endor, he was under the command of Moff Leonia Tavira and often feared that if he failed, he would be punished harshly. Shortly before the liberation on Eiattu, he and another trooper were patrolling the deep swamps near the capital city, searching for the body of the Quarren Rebel pilot, Nrin Vakil. Nrin was hiding in the murky water, waiting to ambush the Imperials. When Devers leaned over the edge of his patrol boat, he was pulled down by Nrin and drowned.",
