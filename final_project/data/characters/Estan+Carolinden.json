 "content": "Estan Carolinden was a Human male who was a member of the Intarsa League criminal faction during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Around 31 BBY, Carolinden and the League were aboard a shuttle traveling close to the planet Cularin when they were attacked by a rival group of criminals and crashed in the grounds of the Blue Star Centre, a philosophical research facility. Carolinden and the Intarsa League entered the facility and took its inhabitants hostage in an attempt to gain passage off of Cularin. However, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelancers who operated in the Cularin system, attacked the Intarsa League and defeated Carolinden and his compatriots to free the hostages.",
