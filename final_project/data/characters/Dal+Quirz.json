 "content": "Dal Quirz was a female Kadrillian scientist whom Darth Vader forced to cultivate kunda crystals on the planet Kadril.\nDal Quirz was infected by Darth Vader with the Pacifog by which Quirz Father's orders followed. Thus he conducted her tests on Kunda, which proved that she had made a filter for Fathers chemical weapon.\nWhen Quirz came into contact with Lon Prador and the Heroes of Yavin, she remembered nothing more about Darth Vader and the Empire. Quirz was assisted by Rodno, her young assistant. His experimental invention of the Vibro-crystal provided protection against the Pacifog. When Quirz remembered Vadre, she allied her support to Leia and Chewbacca, while Han and Luke drew Rodno to the Nociv area, where the Kunda was. She joined Leia when the communications of Darth Vader were disturbed by an Orbital Relayer.",
