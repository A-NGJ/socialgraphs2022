 "content": "Bish was a Quarren male pilot and slave. He bragged of his piloting skills. In around 20 BBY, Bish was captured by slaver Phylus Mon and kept in a cell in Mon's slave zoo aboard the Animiasma. Phylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves. The explosive would be activated in the case of Phylus Mon's death, but it could also be deactivated with the impact of an ion weapon. All the slaves in Phylus Mon's zoo were also regularly battered.",
