 "content": "M'iiyoom Onith, also known as Nightlily, was a female H'nemthe. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, she stayed in Mos Eisley, Tatooine, where she was courted by Feltipern Trevaggâ€”a Gotal tax collector who did not realize the dangers of romancing a sharp-tongued H'nemthe.\nM'iiyoom Onith first appeared as a background alien in the cantina scene of George Lucas's 1977 film Star Wars, played by an uncredited actor and seen snuggling up to the Gotal character Feltipern Trevagg. Onith was one of the scene's booth-dwelling aliens whose masks were designed by makeup artist Rick Baker, created for supplemental shooting done during post-production when Lucas decided to liven the scene with more action and additional characters. Given the on-set nickname of Yam Nose, Onith was intended to receive the proper name of Yamnoss, but the idea never saw the light of day. However, a H'nemthe character in 1978's The Star Wars Holiday Special that re-used Onith's mask was eventually dubbed Yamnoss. Onith's mask was also re-used for a H'nemthe character that appeared in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.\nOnith's name was established in 1995 with the release of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's Premiere Limited set. Her character was fleshed out by author Barbara Hambly in the short story Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale, which was included in the 1995 anthology Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. Ashley Albert voiced the character in the audio drama of Nightlily.\nThe name was then confirmed to be canon by the reference book Star Wars: Complete Location, which was released on September 27, 2016.",
