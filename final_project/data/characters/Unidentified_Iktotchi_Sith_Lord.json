 "content": "An Iktotchi Sith Lord was a male who reigned as a Lord of the Sith. At some point during the Iktotchi's lifetime, he searched for a Jedi, and used the Force to aid him in tracking the individual. The Sith Lord had red and black tattoos, and his right eye was yellow. His face's left side was covered with a cybernetic enhancement. The Iktotchi was sensitive to the Force, and dressed in black Sith robes.\nThe Iktotchi Sith Lord appeared in an image created for the Jedi Academy Training Manual, a resource guide for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The image was used to demonstrate a Force technique called \"Force Track.\"",
