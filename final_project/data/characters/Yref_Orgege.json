 "content": "Yref Orgege was an Imperial Moff in control of Hutt Sector after Moff Sarn Shild committed suicide. Orgege tried to fix the mistakes of his predecessor, namely the failed military invasion of Nar Shaddaa, by keeping his forces in tighter control. The Imperial fleet under his command could never act on its own without first checking in and receiving his okay. This gave Bria Tharen hope that certain Rebel groups, specifically the organized resistance on Teth under the command of Winfrid Dagore, could begin invading Imperial supply lines with impunity while the the command structure was tied up in the bureaucracy surrounding Orgege.",
