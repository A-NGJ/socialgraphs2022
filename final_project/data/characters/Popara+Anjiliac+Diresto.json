 "content": "Popara Anjiliac Diresto was a Hutt who owned a large financial empire. His main home was a spire on Nar Shaddaa.\nMost of his capital came from legitimate business practices. He was not very trusting of others, yet he could be counted on as one of the most trustworthy of the Hutts. He believed that legitimate businesses could bring in more wealth than any criminal activities. He had two offspring, Mika Anjiliac Chiera and Zonnos Anjiliac Priare. He later adopted Vago Gejalli Thokka, a Hutt of the Gejalli clan, when the Huttlet's blood clan was killed.\nPopara owned three female Twi'lek slaves who were Force-sensitive. They told him the intentions of anyone who did business with him.\nPopara's Ubrikkian yacht was the Imru Ootmian. He was also the owner of Skydove Freight.\nHe was killed by his younger offspring, Mika, who blamed the murder on Zonnos.\nBecause the adventure Tempest Feud is not given a specific era, and the scenario supports campaigns taking place in the Rise of the Empire era, Rebellion era, New Republic era, or New Jedi Order era, Popara could have been living at any point between 100 BBY and 40 ABY, though the adventure as written cannot take place between 26 ABY to 29 ABY, since it involves Nar Shaddaa. At the time of the scenario, he is \"centuries\" old, and owns a yacht built in the Rise of the Empire period. At one point, Popara hosts two Twi'lek envoys from Nirama, the Cularin system crime lord. Nirama, thus far, is only known to have operated before the rise of the New Order.",
