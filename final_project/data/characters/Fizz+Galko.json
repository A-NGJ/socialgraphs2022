 "content": "Fizz Galko was a male Rodian Doctor who worked as a bioengineer for the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nDuring the Galactic War, Fizz was stationed on Belsavis where he developed Xenovirus Prime and planned on using it as part of an initiative against the Republic to target specific Republic-allied sentient species. He was responsible for administering the virus to the planet's most dangerous prisoners who were the intended carriers and vectors for spreading it to the Republic. He later tasked an Imperial hero to detect infected aliens and mark their cells for further reference.",
