 "content": "Qo'el was a Human female and daughter of Odar who lived on the planet Ord Mantell during the Cold War.\nWhen Oradam village was searched by Mantellian soldiers of the Galactic Republic, Qo'el was arrested due to her suspected ties with the separatists. Taken to Fort Garnik for interrogation, Qo'el insisted she had no information to share, but her interrogator, Kellik, refused to believe her and began to physically assault to force her to confess what he wanted to hear. Thankfully, a Republic patriot sent by her father Odar arrived to rescue her.",
