 "content": "Bolin Volfrham was a male human and a wealthy capitalist. In order to polish his image, he and his wife Willa adopted Jinko, a young sentient primate. Not only did Volfrham rear Jinko without love, but as soon as the child grew older and was not deemed \"cute\" enough anymore, he replaced him with a baby Xot. Volfrham had Jinko put aboard an escape pod that was launched on the surface of an otherwise uninhabited planet. Later on, Volfrham condemned his accountant Crez Lorell, and even his wife Willa to the same exile.",
