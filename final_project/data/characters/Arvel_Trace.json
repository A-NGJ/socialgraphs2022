 "content": "Arvel Trace was the Imperial Governor of Sesid, the Draedan homeworld.\nThough he left the natives mostly alone for the early part of his term in office, he eventually decided to supply the dictatorial leaders of two major Draedan nations, Feynir and Maeril, with Imperial weapons. In return for using these weapons to subdue other Draedan nations, the Imperial-allied Draedans would give the Imperials a share of the spoils. This plan backfired when other Draedan nations retaliated by allying against his clients. These nations announced allegiance to the Rebel Alliance and traded the valuable medical supplies of Sesid's oceans to weapons smugglers. Trace's forces were spread too thinly to effectively stop this trade, and Sesid was not valuable enough to warrant reinforcements.",
