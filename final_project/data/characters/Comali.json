 "content": "Comali was a human female who held the title of Lady on Shu-Torun. Her son was a guard for the planet's monarch, Queen Trios, but was killed, with Trios claiming he had died protecting her from terrorists. Still grieving over her son's death, Comali attended a party Trios held in the Abyssal Rooms, leaving before the event had finished. However, due to a Rebel Alliance mission, Comali was unable to leave, as the planet's entire security system had been shut down by Leia Organa and her team.",
