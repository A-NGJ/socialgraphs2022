 "content": "Riic Mardec was a Human cab driver.\nA native of Gotida, Mardec lived in Jalor City with his wife Lina and two daughters, Sale and Fora. He was a law-abiding citizen who worked as a cab driver for fourteen years. He wanted to save enough money to move to a better place to raise his daughters.\nUnfortunately, in 2 ABY, the Mardecs  died in a crossfire when the Galactic Empire attacked a Rebel cell. The \"collateral damage\" could have happened due to Rebel or Imperial fire, but Mardec began blaming the \"revolutionary\" Alliance. Afterward, he began frequenting canteens and saying he would get revenge.\nRebel cell leader Detta Rotan considered a formal apology to Mardec in the name of the Alliance, no matter who was really guilty. Should Mardec refuse the apology, Rotan suggested helping him as much as possible.",
