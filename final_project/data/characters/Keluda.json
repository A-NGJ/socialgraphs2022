 "content": "Keluda was a male Dug spacer who served as a known associate to Vilmarh Grahrk.\nDuring his lifetime, his brother was one of the workers at the Golden Nyss Shipyards killed when the station was blown up by the Yinchorri. Keluda also owned a speeder bike. He was acquainted with Gar Gastinin, Vletho, a Kubaz, and a Trandoshan, with whom he drank with at the Cluster Cantina on Nar Shaddaa.\nHe was a member of the Assassin's Guild, and later tried to get the hit on Simon Greyshade after Tsian was apprehended and the contract was officially open again. When his speeder was destroyed by Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi suspended him in mid-air to question him about the attempted assassination. He told Kenobi Venco Autem was behind it, tried to kill the Jedi and was subsequently killed when his blaster bolt was reflected back at him by Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber and his dead body fell into the Coruscant cityscape.",
