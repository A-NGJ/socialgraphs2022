 "content": "The Damask clan was a prominent Muun family of Muunilinst. In the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, the Damask clan was involved with both the InterGalactic Banking Clan and Damask Holdings.\nThe first known member of the clan was a Hego, clan father of Caar Damask. Caar was a member of long standing in the Banking Clan, who, both as a favor to High Officer Mals Tonith and in hopes of advancing a career that had stalled and kept him in middle management, became the administrator of Mygeeto and its crystal mines at some point during the 9th century of the Great Peace of the Republic period. Ten years after his arrival on Mygeeto, Damask was manipulated into meeting his future codicil wife by the Sith Lord Darth Tenebrous, also known as the Bith Rugess Nome, who knew that their child would be very strong in the the Force. Tenebrous was correct—their son, the future Dark Lord Hego Damask—named after his grandfather—was born on Mygeeto in due course. When Hego turned five, he was handed over to Nome, who took him as his apprentice and named him Darth Plagueis.\nHego would later found a plasma mining company called Damask Holdings, which the Sith Lord used to further the Sith imperative.\nPlagueis claimed, in 65 BBY, that he killed all his relatives, leaving him the sole heir to the Damask fortune.\nThe Damask family apparently died off in 32 BBY, when Plagueis's apprentice, Darth Sidious, murdered his master in his apartment.",
