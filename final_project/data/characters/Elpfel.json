 "content": "Elpfel was a Mon Calamari with orange eyes and mottled brown skin who served as an officer in the Rebel Fleet, holding the rank of commander during the Galactic Civil War fought between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. Elpful was the commanding officer of the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Wavesong and wore a beige Mon Calamari Crewman uniform.\nAt some point, Elpfel talked about capital ships, including Imperial ones, which the Mon Calamari described as \"the most awesome weapons of war ever constructed\" with their heavy armor plating, high-powered shielding, and enormous amounts of firepower making them capable of destroying planets. However, Elpfel considered it lucky for the galaxy that the Imperial capital ships were not unstoppable, mentioning their high power consumption, low maneuverability, complex redundant system design, large crew requirements, and tactical disadvantages against small starfighters as flaws.\nElpfel was introduced in 1997's Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition, a supplement for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.",
