 "content": ".\nWarrick Raden was a male Devaronian criminal who lived in the city Zarra on the planet Cato Neimoidia during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Raden worked for the Hutt crime lord Darga Jiramma Mionne and he carried messages and extorted money on Darga's behalf. In about 17 BBY, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents traveled to Cato Neimoidia in search of Darga and they located Raden and a group of Darga's thugs inside a ruined warehouse. Raden refused to show the agents to Darga's residence and he and his thugs attacked them. However, the agents defeated Raden and forced him to lead them to Darga's palace. Raden introduced the agents to Darga and the Hutt recruited them into his organization. However, Darga believed that Raden had betrayed him and the Devaronian was subequently dragged to the palace's dungeons by two Gamorrean guards.",
