 "content": "A Vagaari guard member of the Vagaari nomadic species and their Empire served aboard the Vagaari species ruler's warship in 27 BBY. After Human smuggler Jorj Car'das arrived at the warship and was brought to the Miskara, the ruler of the Vagaari, the guard reprimanded and hit the Human, as he had spoken to the Miskara before he was spoken to. Then, Car'das remained silent, and was complimented by the Vagaari ruler, who engaged in a conversation with the Human. The guard, along with all the Vagaari on the warship were later killed by Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth and all the Force-wielding Jedi aboard the massive starship the Miskara and his fleet attempted to seize, Outbound Flight, as the force users performed a Force meld which destroyed all of the Vagaari's minds, killing them.\nThe guard appeared in the 2007 novel Outbound Flight written by Timothy Zahn.",
