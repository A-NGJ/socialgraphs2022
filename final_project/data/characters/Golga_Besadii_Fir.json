 "content": "Golga Besadii Fir was a Hutt diplomat that served as the final ambassador on behalf of his goverment to the New Republic.\nHe was assigned to the Hutt consulate on Coruscant by the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War. When the Hutts allied with the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong, Golga began to make preparations to leave Coruscant for Nal Hutta. It was at this point he received a visit from New Republic Senator Viqi Shesh who the Hutt imagined what she would look like as a dancer.\nThe Senator hoped to pass informal intelligence to the Hutts of New Republic assets in the hope that this disinformation would be passed to the Hutt's Yuuzhan Vong allies.\nAlthough a member of the Besadii clan, he had Desilijic blood in him, which was possibly the reason he found Human women attractive.",
