 "content": "A male Sakiyan was present onboard the The Wheel space station in 22 BBY during the Clone Wars. Whilst he was on the station, the Sakiyan was passed by the Twi'lek Jedi Aayla Secura, whom was disguised as a mechanic named Jaayza and searching for her Jedi Master Quinlan Vos who was working undercover on the station.\nThe Sakiyan appeared for the first time in the Star Wars: Republic comic series in issue 49 published in 2003. Titled Sacrifice, the issue was written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Jan Duursema.",
