 "content": "Rolu Strom was a male Human bounty hunter and brother of Edo.\nRolu Strom's father was the legendary bounty hunter, Philo Strom. Both Strom and his brother, Edo, also became bounty hunters, exploiting their father's name to gain a reputation neither of them was skilled enough to uphold, resulting in every mission they took being an attempt to prove themselves as good as their father. In the year 2 ABY, Strom and his brother traveled to search for the sculpture aboard the luxury cruiser Reverie which lay wrecked in a Starship Graveyard at the edge of the galaxy. The starship was full of spider-like Arachedron creatures who lived on the ship. They separated themselves when suddenly Boba Fett arrived to the ship. They saved his life and captured him. Later they realized if they collaborated with Fett they could survive the attacks of Arachedron creatures. A few hours later they found a room full with Arachedrons and seemed to be attracted to the sculpture. They saw a Dressellian treasure hunter named Somaz, who wore one of the creatures corpses to disguise himself and made his way to the statue and scaled it, but as he reached the top the Mandalorian bounty hunter and the Strom brothers approached the statue.\nThe three hunters explained that they were there to claim the valuable artifact for themselves, and demanded Somaz hand it over. The Dresssellian cursed his luck and removed the sculpture, causing a huge number of Arachedron to become frenzied and attack all four hunters. As the group fought of the insects Somaz explained that it was the artifact that the creatures wanted, not them. Coming to the decision that the value of the artifact wasn't worth his life, Fett took the sculpture from Somaz and hurled it into the depths of the ship, causing the Arachedron to follow. Horrified at Fett's decision Rolu leapt at the Mandalorian and cursed him before leaping after it into the abyss. Edo reached to try and save his brother but failed, prompting Somaz to try and pull back Edo and persuade him it was time to leave. Edo refused to leave though and followed his brother into the depths of the collapsing ship, returning Fett's jetpack first.",
