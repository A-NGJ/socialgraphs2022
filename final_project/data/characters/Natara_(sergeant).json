 "content": "Natara was a female Rutian Twi'lek who served as a sergeant in the Republic Army during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire, when she was stationed the space station Carrick Station.\nSergeant Natara appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendors for the Trooper class; her actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history. She was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, she remains in the game, as her character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
