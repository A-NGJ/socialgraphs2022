 "content": "Lar Ndigo was a Human male in the New Republic Defense Fleet.\nIn 13 ABY, Lieutenant Lar Ndigo met Chief of State Leia Organa Solo on Coruscant after he distinguished himself in a battle on Rirsack. She sent him to Battle of assist General Han Solo on Nam Chorios.\nHowever, Ndigo, now a captain, only met General Solo in the aftermath of the Battle of Pallaxides. Solo assigned him a MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser to investigate the disappearance of the cruiser Endor soon before.\nWhen arriving near the planet RZ7-6113-23, Captain Ndigo's ship was engaged by a surface-to-space cannon. Fearing a trap, he ordered the activation of the deflector shield just before the impact. While the surface cannon was reloading, his damaged ship was immediately attacked by old Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters but they were easily repelled by the more modern A-wings. Understanding that his ship was too damaged to resist another hit, even with the shields at maximum power, Ndigo decided to disable the shields and concentrate all power to the turbolasers so as to attack the planet. The cruiser was able to destroy the surface cannon before it could shoot the ship once again.",
