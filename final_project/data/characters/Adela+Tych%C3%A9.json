 "content": "Adela Tyché was a female Human and a skilled pilot. She worked for Borvo the Hutt around the time of the Invasion of Naboo and temporarily joined the Naboo resistance before Borvo betrayed the Naboo people.\nDuring her early years, she traveled extensively, strengthening her piloting and fighting abilities. She also learned to speak many different languages, including Basic and Huttese. Those skills as a translator and advisor impressed Borvo, who soon employed her as his personal pilot and bodyguard.\nDuring the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Borvo allied with the Naboo Security Forces after they rescued him from Trade Federation forces. Tyché was on hand to translate Borvo's gratitude to the officers. She went on to fly several missions alongside Captain Kael and Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes, using an N-1 against the droid army and helped free captured slaves. Borvo then betrayed the Security Forces by selling the rescued Naboo slaves in secret and shot down Kael to cover his tracks. Tyché joined the Hutt in his base on Porso Hill, and took control of his personal transport. Sykes attacked Borvo's freighter in revenge and she taunted the Naboo pilot. Tyché subsequently escaped with Borvo back to Nal Hutta in the cockpit module when Sykes destroyed the ship.\nAdela Tyché was capable of flying a number of craft, and also spoke Basic and Huttese. She was prone to taunting those she fought against.\nAdela Tyché was voiced by Susan Zelinsky in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.",
