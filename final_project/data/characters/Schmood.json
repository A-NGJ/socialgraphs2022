 "content": "Schmood was a male Yuzzum who worked for Grappa the Hutt. In 11 ABY, Schmood heard Grappa calling for help, and found him locked up. While freeing him, Schmood informed Grappa that Sol Mon, a follower of Grappa's, had left his palace because of the Black Sun. When asked by Grappa why he stayed in the palace, Schmood stated that he was just doing his duty. Grappa then slapped Schmood into the cell with his tail and closed the door, claiming that Schmood should have rescued him while the rebels were still in his palace. Grappa left Schmood trapped.",
