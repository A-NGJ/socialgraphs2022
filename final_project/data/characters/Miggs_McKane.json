 "content": "Miggs McKane was a human male who worked as a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku. While there, he at some point spent several hours negotiating with the scavenger Rey over a trade which resulted in Rey receiving hydrospanners in all eight standard configurations with spare power cells. The occupants of Niima Outpost claimed that McKane managed to slice into the datacore of a crashed Imperial Star Destroyer and found a complete order of battle.\nHe then sold his find to an offworlder and used the profits to retire to Ogem, a planet located close to Jakku. By 34 ABY, Rey recorded McKane's tale in a survival guide she compiled, including a sketch of him alongside it. In the illustration, McKane was depicted with facial hair, wearing a pair of goggles and a hat.\nMiggs McKane was first created for Rey's Survival Guide, a replica journal released on December 18, 2015 which was written by Jason Fry with illustrations by Andrew Barthelmes.",
