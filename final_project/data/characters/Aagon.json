 "content": "Lieutenant Aagon was a Human male stormtrooper who was assigned to Jerec's Vengeance Battle Group during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 5 ABY, his platoon, Patrol 341, contained Leeno and Sergeant Forley. A resourceful officer, he kept his soldiers occupied on patrol by taking them to hunt Bouncers outside of their patrol zone. Together with many, many others, he was killed on Ruusan by Kyle Katarn, courtesy of an unfortunate encounter with a lightsaber.\nIn the audio adaptation of Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, he was voiced by Christopher Bloch.",
