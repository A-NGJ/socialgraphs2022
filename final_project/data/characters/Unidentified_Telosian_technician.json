 "content": "This unidentified technician was a male Human who lived on the planet Telos IV. Sometime in 44 BBY, the technician was in charge of transmitting images of Telox IV as stage background whenever former Jedi Xanatos was giving prizes to the Katharsis winners. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn used the Force in convincing the technician to show images that Xanatos' company, Offworld Mining Corporation, was stripping their planet of its resources.\nThe technician was fond of eating meat pies even while working, which covered all his fingers in grease.",
