 "content": "Frye Troeman was a Human male businessman who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, he operated out of Coronet City. In 1 ABY, Troeman owned some money to a gadget specialist for services performed on a malfunctioning terminal but refused to pay. As the gadget specialist used to work with the Corellian Security Force, the gadget specialist once requested a spacer working with CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper to collect the payment from Troeman. The businessman was reluctant but apparently accepted to pay. In fact, he sent his henchmen to assassinate the spacer. Nevertheless, the spacer managed to kill all the assassins. When the spacer returned to him, Frye Troeman was forced to pay off his debt.\nFrye Troeman was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nFrye Troeman was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. He was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
