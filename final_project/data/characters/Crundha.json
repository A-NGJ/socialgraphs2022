Major Crundha aided Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin in attaining experimental hyperdrive technology from the Habeen during the Conflict at Mylok IV. Crundha accompanied Admiral Zaarin very closely during the campaign, however Crundha was described as helpless by Admiral Zaarin himself, insisting that the Habeen mission could not be accomplished had he had not been present.",
