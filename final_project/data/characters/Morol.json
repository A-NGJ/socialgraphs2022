 "content": "Morol was a Human who worked in Just Armor, a store carrying a variety of starship armor and personal armor, located on the space station StarForge Station in 0 ABY. While Morol took care of armor repair and fitting, Gjaddia, another Human, was the businessman.\nMorol first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from the 1998 book The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit. Morol was not given a gender in The Far Orbit Project.",
