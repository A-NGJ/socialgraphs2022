 "content": "\"The Elder\" was a human male Force-sensitive individual. This individual was speculated by Jedi Master Tajin Crosser to be a former member of the Sith who broke away prior to the Order's destruction. Centuries following the fall of the Sith, he encountered Tajin and his Padawan Dan G'vash on a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. After defeating Dan easily, the dark side adept was killed by Tajin. His last act before he died was to detonate his starship, preventing the Jedi from learning more about him.\nEarlier in his life, The Elder learnt lightsaber combat and some Force powers, such as Force lightning. The Elder fought on various occasions—what he referred to as \"when he was much stronger\"—and ultimately abandoned his \"faction\" or teachings.\nThe dark side adept was a confident and intimidating old man. He saw himself above his late fellow Sith Order members whom he believed too consumed by their own lust for power that they forgot their true destiny and destroying themselves in the process.\nThe Elder appeared in \"The Elder,\" a short film in the Star Wars: Visions series. The Elder is voiced by Kenichi Yagata in Japanese and James Hong in English.",
