 "content": "Deverén was a S'kytri female spokesbeing for the Supreme Council of the Highland Clans on the planet Skye during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 ABY, her homeworld—sworn to serve the Galactic Empire and purposely cut off from outsiders—was visited by Rebel agents Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker, who had come to the world to aid their friend Han Solo in his dispute with the Majestrix of Skye, Kharys. Deverén presided over the meeting of the Supreme Council that was to decide Skywalker and Organa's fates, and they were fully prepared to hand them over the Empire before Deverén realized that Skywalker carried the same lightsaber as one of the Jedi who had helped save Skye during the Clone Wars. With that knowledge in mind, Deverén and the rest of the Council resolved to help Skywalker and Organa with their fight against Kharys.\nDeverén first appeared in Star Wars Annual  1, written by Chris Claremont and released in 1979. In the issue, Deverén was illustrated by Mike Vosburg.",
