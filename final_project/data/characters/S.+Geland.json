Geland was a male Human that was the chief warden of the Galactic Republic prison on Belsavis, The Tomb; but he secretly was also one of the Children of the Emperor and he tried many times to stop the Barsen'thor when he arrived on his prison. Finally, he directly confronted the Barsen'thor and the Jedi's allies together with two battle droids but the Barsen'thor killed him at last. During the final confrontation with Tenebrae, Geland was among the spirits that were summoned and witnessed his final death. After the Emperor's death, Geland found peace and became one with the Force.\nGeland is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.",
