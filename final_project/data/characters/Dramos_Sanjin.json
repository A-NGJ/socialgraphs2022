 "content": "Line Lieutenant Dramos Sanjin was a male Human who served as a stormtrooper within the military of the Empire of the Hand.\nIn 8 ABY, Sanjin traveled to the planet Quethold aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Admonitor and he participated in an Imperial attack on the world, against the combined forces of the alien warlord Nuso Esva and the Quesoth species. During the battle, Sanjin led three stormtrooper squads into the Red City aboard A-rack carriers, and the stormtroopers engaged a large number of Quesoth Soldiers in the street Setting Sun Avenue. The stormtroopers were eventually overcame by the numerically superior Quesoth and Sanjin prepared to make a final stand. However, the Quesoth Soldiers were tricked into leaving the battle after the Imperial forces played a Quesoth Soldier Speak recording that ordered the soldiers to retreat and defend their Queen.",
