 "content": "Jalan was a male Human and associate of Captain Arwen Cohl. He went with Cohl to Dorvalla, on a mission for the Nebula Front, to steal a shipment of aurodium ingots from the Trade Federation freighter Revenue. Though the mission was successful, and the crew escaped through an arm pod, Jalan was hopelessly caught underneath a computer console when the pod they were in was shot down. Most other members of the crew had died. Jalan chose to accept his fate, and died taking down some members of the Dorvalla Space Corps by self-destructing what remained of the ship.",
