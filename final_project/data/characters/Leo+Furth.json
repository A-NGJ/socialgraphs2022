 "content": "Leo Furth was a male Human captain in the Imperial Military of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. Part of Imperial Search and Recovery, in 3642 BBY he was stationed on Hoth in the Dorn Base and provided Cipher Nine information on the whereabouts of Admiral Layek Davos. He avoided mentioning that Davos has gone rogue and planned to severe ties with the Empire, because he was with the Admiral for the past ten years and thus was among the conspirators who were part of his plan. Furth arranged for Davos to meet with Pashok the Unyielding of the White Maw pirates and after the two agreed to work together, they departed for the Star of Coruscant in the Starship Graveyard, where they attempted to seize the shuttle Starbreeze. However, Cipher Nine and Raina Temple interrupted their attempts and in the ensuing firefight both Davos and Furth were killed.",
