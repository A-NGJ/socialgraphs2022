 "content": "Pashon Cortess was a male Human on son of Baron Peyar Cortess and Chay Cortess and member of House Cortess. Around 3641 BBY he received information from Hunter on the whereabouts of Cipher Nine and vowed to kill them for \"ruining\" his family's prestige. He approached the agent on Belsavis Orbital Station, but was outmatched. Before passing out, he told the agent that Nine's other victims would come to seek their vengeance.\nImperial security then arrived, astounded at having been duped by Pashon, as he arrived claiming authorization from House Thul and ask Cipher as to Pashon's fate, with the agent ordering him executed.\nPashon Cortess is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game, appearing in the Imperial Agent Chapter 3 quest \"Heist.\"\nIf Vector Hyllus is the player's companion, there will be special dialogue, in which Vector attempts to talk down Pashon but this has no effect on avoiding a fight.\nDepending on the player's choices, Pashon's fate is decided three ways:",
