 "content": "Nep Chung was a male Phuii member of the criminal syndicate Black Sun. Having attained the rank of Vigo, Chung and the rest of the Black Sun leadership were brutally slaughtered during an attack by the Sith Darth Maul.\nA male Phuii, Nep Chung became involved in the criminal organization Black Sun, eventually rising through the ranks and attaining the title Vigo, making him one of the nine lieutenant of the syndicate. To protect him, Chung employed bodyguards to ensure his safety, including a personal guard of his own species.\nIn 33 BBY, the Vigos of Black Sun unknowingly became the targets of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious and his master, Darth Plagueis. Due to time restraints, the Sith would not be able to hunt down the Vigos separately and kill them; instead the Sith would need to lure them together so they could die at once. Ordering his apprentice Darth Maul to hunt down two Vigos at first, Sidious anticipated Black Sun leader Alexi Garyn to order the survivors to a single location.\nIndeed, after the Zabrak assassin had killed Vigos Morn and Darnada Garyn summoned the remaining vigos, including Chung, to his fortress on Ralltiir. When the vigos had all gathered, Darth Maul infiltrated the fortress and slaughtered all the guards before making his way into the central chamber the Vigos had congregated in. One by one Maul cut down the guards before executing the Vigos. During the fighting, Maul murdered Chung with his lightsaber.",
