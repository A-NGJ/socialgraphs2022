 "content": "Darth Silthar was a male Human Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA male Human, Silthar served the Sith Empire during the first quarter of the Inter-Sith Wars period. By the time of the Cold War, a period of unrest between Empire and the Galactic Republic, he had proven to be one of the strongest Sith Lords and ascended to the title of Darth. He had also successfully trained his apprentice Hargrev and brought him to lordship.\nSilthar often worked with the Imperial Reclamation Service captain Barden Golah. During their time together, he found a lost temple on Ziost and the crystal caves of Molavar. Around 3643 BBY on Tatooine, he led the investigation into the secrets of the long abandoned Czerka Arms base. At some point, he was captured by the Sand People after he slaughtered a number during his search for the secrets he sought. He was found injured inside of one of the caves by an Imperial individual, where he died soon afterwards.\nDarth Silthar first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG produced by BioWare and LucasArts. Silthar's means of death is dependent on the player's choice. Sparing Silthar before destroying the Sand People mural  is the light side option; the player may also choose the dark side option and kill Silthar themselves, then destroy the mural.",
