 "content": "In 32 BBY a Tusken war chief resided on the outskirts of Mos Espa among his clan of Tusken Raiders near a Tusken burial site. The remains of a derelict sandcrawler served as their home, where he held the Queen of Naboo hostage as a trophy.\nUpon landing on the desert world of Tatooine in 32 BBY, the Queen's handmaiden Padmé Amidala set out for Mos Espa, a nearby city, with the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, and R2-D2. While they were absent, Sabé  received a message from Governor Sio Bibble, pleading her to contact him on Naboo. Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Padawan of Jinn, cautioned against this, a warning she heeded. At any rate, she could not act without the Queen's authority, but still found the situation she was in to be highly taxing.\nWhile biding their time, Sabé was captured by Tusken Raiders and taken to the war chief. Kenobi tracked them through their extensive canyon dwellings among old scavenged wrecks, and was forced to journey through a communal Tusken burial site in search of her. He located the decoy Queen being held in a derelict craft that they used for shelter and was led into a confrontation with the war chief, whom he subsequently defeated. In an odd move for the Sand People, the remainder among them solemnly and ceremoniously conceded defeat after Kenobi demanded to be allowed to return to safety with Sabé. Having slain the Tusken war chief and successfully rescued Sabé, the duo returned to the ship and awaited their companions return.\nYears later, while in hiding on Tatooine, Kenobi would recount of this incident in a meditative conversation with the Force spirit of his former Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.\nThe Tusken war chief was a boss in the game Star Wars: Obi-Wan.",
