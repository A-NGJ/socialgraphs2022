 "content": "Maliiki was a male Jawa spy. While he was attempting to rebuild an escaped droid in Mos Eisley, another assassin droid cut the ropes holding a catwalk where he stood. As he fell, a crate tumbled over him, trapping the Jawa. Later, he was rescued by a medical droid, who he rewarded by guiding him to the nearly-finished droid and the data crystal with important information that it possessed.",
