 "content": "This Imperial captain was a captain in the Imperial Navy. He had a role in tracking down the identity of the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. The captain was distinguished by a horizontal mark across the bridge of his nose.\nFollowing the end of the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader returned to Coruscant and landed his TIE Advanced x1 outside the Imperial Palace. He was greeted by this captain and several stormtroopers. Vader told the man to use any means necessary to track down the identity of the pilot who had played a role in the Empire's defeat at Yavin by destroying the Death Star. The captain promised that it would be done at once, and he departed to fulfill Vader's request.\nSometime later, when Vader was overseeing the launching of several shuttles from the bridge of a Star Destroyer, the captain gave Vader a handheld holoprojector holding the identity of the pilot. Vader was shocked to learn that the pilot was Luke Skywalker, his own son. The captain was later seen aboard the Executor during a launching of viper probe droids. He witnessed a defective R2 unit transmit a hologram of Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader. The Emperor had discovered one of Vader's secret students, Tao, and Palpatine ordered his apprentice to execute the boy in front of the crew of the ship. Vader complied, and Tao's fatally wounded body fell to the floor of the bridge.\nThe Imperial captain left the bridge briefly to obtain a method of removing the boy's body from the ship, but when he returned, both Tao and Vader had disappeared. The captain saw Tao's blood on the floor of the ship, but the two had otherwise disappeared. The man questioned a stormtrooper about the whereabouts of Vader, but the trooper had no response. The captain broke into a sweat over the unexplained absence of Vader, but his worries were unfounded. Vader eventually returned to the ship, having left briefly to bury Tao on his home planet of Shumari.\nThis individual only appears in the story Perfect Evil, which spanned issues Black and Silver of Star Wars Manga. Originally published in Japan, those stories were considered to be of \"fuzzy\" continuity by Lucasfilm. Since then, they have been republished in English in the United Kingdom under the Infinities label, which established the material in them as non-canonical. The planet Shumari has been later referenced in The Essential Atlas, which included the Shumari system in its appendix. However, according to Jason Fry, \"its inclusion shouldn't be taken as a statement of canonicity for anything except the geography.\"",
