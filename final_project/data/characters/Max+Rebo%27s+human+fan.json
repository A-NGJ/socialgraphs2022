 "content": "Ortolan musician Max Rebo had a human fan who resided on the planet Jakku. The fan, who had light-colored skin, thought Rebo's best album was \"Anything Interesting\" and Rebo's worst album was \"Junk and Garbage\". The fan had searched Jakku for \"Anything Interesting\" without success, only able to find \"Junk and Garbage\". Frustrated with their inability to locate the desired album, they expressed this to a traveler in Niima Outpost.\nThe fan appeared in the 2022 non-canon video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, published by TT Games.",
