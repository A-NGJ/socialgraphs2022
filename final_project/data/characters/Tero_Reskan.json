 "content": "Tero Reskan was a Human male who lived on the planet Coruscant during the early years of the Galactic Empire. At one time, he ran a shipping business that operated on routes through the Deep Core, but the business was eventually nationalized by the Empire and Reskan was forced out of the organization. He became an agent of Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and in about 17 BBY, Reskan acted as a contact for a team of Alderaanian Resistance operatives that were dispatched to Coruscant to locate the headquarters of a clandestine Imperial project. The agents subsequently infiltrated Imeici Spire, a skyscraper in the CoCo Town district in which the project was based, and afterward Reskan picked them up in an airspeeder and took them to a safehouse. He then passed on to Organa information regarding the outcome of the mission.",
