 "content": "Kamel was a male Bith undersecretary of the Balmorran government during the Cold War. During the Battle of Balmorra Kamel and other Balmorran officials-in-exile were invited by Tai Cordan to join with a Balmorran resistance cell led by a revolutionary named Zenith as they were about to rescue the President of Balmorra Retheus Galthe. Unfortunately, prolonged torture by Darth Lachris broke Galthe's mind and a Balmorra citizens committee was assembled by Kamel and other Balmorrans to oversee the transfer of political power to Tai Cordan.\nUndersecretary Kamel appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Consular class mission on Balmorra.",
