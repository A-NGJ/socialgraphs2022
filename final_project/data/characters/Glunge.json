 "content": "Glunge was a Gloovan bounty hunter active during the Galactic Civil War. He worked with fellow bounty hunter Takvax and the swoop racers Kuru and Makta in order to try and claim a bounty on the smuggler Han Solo during a swoop race on the planet Rion. After Kuru and Makta failed to knock Solo off his vehicle, Glunge prepared to shoot the smuggler with a laser-sniper, but was stopped by the Jedi Luke Skywalker, who then also stole Glunge's swoop.\nGlunge was a Gloovan male who worked as a bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin that marked the beginning of 0 ABY, the bounty hunter Takvax and the swoop racer Kuru discovered that the rebel smuggler Han Solo was participating in a swoop race on the planet Rion in the Outer Rim Territories. Takvax enlisted the aid of Glunge and the swoop racer Makta to try and claim the large Imperial bounty on Solo's head, devising a plan that would cause Solo to be sent to a medical center during the race, intending to transport him to the planet Coruscant from there in order to claim the bounty.\nKuru and Makta initially attempted to force Solo into crashing, but they were unsuccessful. After Makta herself crashed, and Kuru used a turbo-booster to move ahead of Solo in the race, Glunge prepared to shoot the smuggler using a laser-sniper from a nearby roof top. Before he could fire, the Jedi Luke Skywalker—an ally of Solo who had forced Takvax to reveal Glunge's location—interrupted him and destroyed the sniper rifle using his lightsaber. Glunge then attempted to flee, running to a swoop that he had parked nearby, but was knocked out by Skywalker after the Jedi realized he would need the vehicle to save Solo. The swoop was destroyed by thermite micro-missiles that Kuru had launched at Solo, but Skywalker helped Solo win the race and leave the planet safely.\nGlunge had purple skin and cyan eyes. He fled after having his weapon destroyed by a lightsaber, as he did not believe any bounty was worth such a risk.\nGlunge wore a yellow outfit with a brown jacket and belt, including a holster and black boots. He used a laser-sniper and a blue swoop.\nGlunge appeared in the comic \"Swoop Racers,\" which was published in Star Wars Adventures  21 on May 8, 2019. The comic was written by Cavan Scott and illustrated by Derek Charm.",
