 "content": "Stepheden Thaldree was a human male who served as an officer of the Canto Bight Police Department in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. He wore a light blue uniform tunic with black stripes on the arms and a betaplast armored collar as well as a pair of blue pants, a white belt and black highly polished synth-hide officer's boots. As an officer of the law, he was equipped with a short-ranged wrist comlink, a scrambled long-range comlink, an electro-shock prod, a police glow rod and two K-25 blasters, one of which he used in heavy configuration. Thaldree had fair skin and brown eyes and hair.\nStepheden Thaldree first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. The character was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
