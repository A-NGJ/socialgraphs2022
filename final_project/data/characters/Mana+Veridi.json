 "content": "Mana Veridi was a female Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order in the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nA Force-sensitive, Mana Veridi was discovered by the Jedi Order near birth and trained in the ways of the Force at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. After constructing her own lightsaber and passing the Trials of Knighthood, Veridi was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Accepting missions from the august body, Veridi was assigned to investigate a disturbance on the Mid Rim world of Kwannot.\nWhile on Kwannot, Veridi felt that the situation had become significantly more dangerous than expected and sent a distress call to Coruscant. Upon receiving the emergency code, the High Council tasked Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to locate Veridi and complete her mission. Homing in on her distress beacon, the Jedi located Veridi hiding amidst the shadows of one of the planet's cities. Recognizing the Jedi, Veridi sighed with relief and began to brief them on her situation. However, before she could begin, the Jedi hunter Aurra Sing ignited her lightsaber and impaled Veridi in the chest, killing her. Sing confiscated Veridi's lightsaber and engaged the Jedi, who were able to drive her off but not capture her.\nCollected from one of Sing's many Jedi kills, Veridi's lightsaber was recovered by the Order several years later during the Clone Wars when Jedi Aayla Secura arrested the bounty hunter.\nOver three decades after her death, exiled Master Obi-Wan Kenobi told Han Solo her story as they journeyed to Alderaan aboard the Millennium Falcon in 0 BBY.",
