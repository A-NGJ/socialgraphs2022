 "content": "Shayl Tasao was a Human female who served as the representative of the Exchange consortium on Tatooine during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, she enlisted the help of an Imperial individual to kill Ghar Bodya. Bodya was defeated at the Dune Sea, and as proof of his death the individual in question took his head off and showed it to Tasao, who gave him a reward with credits.\nShe complained about the terrible smell of the Houk's head and commented she should have taken a refrigerator unit to store it, but instead disposed of it down a garbage chute.",
