 "content": "Grumman Mogotah was a Kentra lord of the city Ironwall on Orellon II during the Galactic Civil War. He was very ambitious and was suspected to be planning to overthrow King Jerius. However, he was not evil as such, but just very ambitious and opportunistic. He was a Master of the Plow.\nDuring a meeting with a group of Rebels, he accused them of lying to the Kentra. After the Rebels had defeated the Voontragi and returned from visiting the Temple of the Je'ulajists, Mogotah confronted them with a group of his supporters. Before any hostilities could break out, they were all attacked by a group of gliders. Fighting off the gliders, the Rebels and Kentra returned to the capital city.",
