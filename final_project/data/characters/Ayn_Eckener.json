 "content": "Ayn Eckener was a Human female citizen of the planet Naboo who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War, sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. She shared the same surname as Karl and Hugo Eckener, prominent members of Naboo society.\nAyn Eckener appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. However, she never actually appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. According to these files, Ayn Eckener would have been on the planet Naboo. Additionally, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
