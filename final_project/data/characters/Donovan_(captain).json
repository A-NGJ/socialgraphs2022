 "content": "Donovan was a Human male CorSec officer and pilot who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Donovan was a captain of the Corellian Security Force on Corellia.\nIn 1 ABY, Captain Donovan was delivering weapons to the local CorSec force in Tyrena when his ship was hijacked by the criminals known as the Deflarians. Donovan himself was captured and imprisoned in the Deflarian bunker. The Deflarians then crashed a ship of the same model than Donovan's to cover the theft of the cargo. CorSec Inspector Cora was tasked by Captain Jark to lead the investigation. Cora hired a spacer who managed to find the location of the bunker. The spacer infiltrated the bunker and found the imprisoned Captain Donovan. The spacer therefore killed Vinros, several Deflarian henchmen and a Deflarian underboss to free Donovan. Captain Jark later discovered that Donovan was betrayed by a CorSec agent, Jori, who sold Donovan's flight schedule to the Deflarians.\nDonovan was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Donovan was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
