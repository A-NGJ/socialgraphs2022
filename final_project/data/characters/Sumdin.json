 "content": "Sumdin was a Gossam female who worked as a Separatist informant during the Clone Wars. She leaked information about Count Dooku's visit to Raxus Secundus to the Nightsister Asajj Ventress. Having outlived her usefulness, Ventress then executed her.\nSumdin was a female Gossam who worked as an informant during the Clone Wars and was acquinated with Asajj Ventress, a Nightsister and Count Dooku's former Sith apprentice. She used her position within the Separatist hierarchy to leak information about Count Dooku's attendance at the Raxian Humanitarian Award ceremony to Ventress and her partner, the undercover Jedi Quinlan Vos. Using this information, Ventress and Vos traveled to rendezvous with Sumdin in Raxus Secundus' capital of Raxulon.\nSumdin met with the two at Raxulon's spaceport where she supplied them with passes that allowed them to infiltrate the ceremony. Ventress then killed Sumdin by slashing her across the torso with her lightsaber in order to maintain the secrecy of their mission. Vos however was uncomfortable with murdering Sumdin, whom he regarded as another sentient being. He carried her lifeless body and hid it before embarking with Ventress on their mission to assassinate Dooku. Regarding her death as unnecessary, Vos used the anger stemming from her death to fuel his desire to fight Dooku.\nAs a Gossam, Sumdin was the size of a humanoid child and spoke Gossam. Owing a favor to Asajj Ventress, Ventress blackmailed Sumdin into divulging Dooku's location. Sumdin complied with Ventress wishes and supplied her and Quinlan Vos with passes that allowed them to infiltrate a Separatist ceremony on Raxus. Not trusting her to keep a secret, Ventress murdered the Gossam.\nSumdin first debuted as a minor character in Christie Golden's 2015 novel Dark Disciple, which was based on eight unproduced screenplays from the canceled Cartoon Network TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Dark Disciple is part of the Canon The Clone Wars Legacy, an ongoing multimedia project using material from the canceled TV series.",
