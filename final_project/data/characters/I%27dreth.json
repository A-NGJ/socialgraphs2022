 "content": "I'dreth was a male Bith who fought in the Cargamalis Street Wars as a sniper. Afterwards, he traveled the Anoat sector during the Iron Blockade, seeking a vengeance only he understood. Though he had a cold outward demeanour, those who knew him were witness to his compassionate heart. He was recruited by the Smuggler during the Uprising, filling the role of a soldier in their ranks.",
