 "content": "As a technician of the Galactic Empire, a Human male individual became disillusioned with the Emperor's New Order and developed sympathies for the Rebel Alliance. In 3 ABY, he worked as a technician on the planet Bespin's Cloud City, modifying a scomp link computer terminal shortly prior to the Empire's occupation of Bespin. Princess Leia Organa, of the planet Alderaan, displayed some interest in his work as she and her compatriots were led through the corridors of Cloud City by Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian. This technician's knowledge of Imperial computer systems led him to become a valuable ally of the Rebels during the Galactic Civil War.\nThis individual was first seen in 1980's Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, where he was played by an uncredited extra. He can be seen in Cloud City as Lando Calrissian, accompanied by Lobot, leads Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa and C-3PO down a flight of stairs from the direction of Platform 327.",
