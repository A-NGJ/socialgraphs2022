 "content": "Gadsle Distombe was a male Twi'lek male Sith Shadow who operated on the planet Dathomir during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nGadsle Distombe is listed as a non-player character in the directory tree files for the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Distombe ever appeared in the game, suggesting that he was merely one of many other NPCs cut from actual inclusion on the live servers. Nonetheless, an emulated depiction of Distombe reveals what he would have looked like, had he been included. The tree files also point to him being a member of the Sith Shadows, a group of thugs which would attack the village of Aurilia on Dathomir.",
