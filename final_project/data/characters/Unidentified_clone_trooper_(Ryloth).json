 "content": "A clone trooper participated in the Battle of Ryloth under command of Clone Captain Keeli. After helping another trooper blow a mountain pass to slow down pursuing Separatist battle droids, he was killed along with the rest of his unit.\nDuring the early stages of the Battle of Ryloth, Jedi General Ima-Gun Di led the Outer Rim garrison to assist the local Twi'lek Resistance combat the Separatist Droid Army. As their forces began to become overwhelmed and forced to retreat, the clone trooper and another clone set up explosive charges on a hill near a LAAT/i gunship filled with explosives, intending to blow the mountain pass to cut off their pursuers. Once the droids approached the gunship, the clones, who were hiding in bushes nearby, detonated the explosives and the mountains surrounding the pass collapsed and blocked the pass. As Syndulla and his fighters continued to flee, Later, this trooper was killed along with General Di, Clone Captain Keeli, and the remaining clones.\nThe trooper first appeared in \"Supply Lines,\" the third episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season.",
