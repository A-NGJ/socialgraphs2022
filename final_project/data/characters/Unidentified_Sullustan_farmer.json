 "content": "A Sullustan female was a farmer at Kat Saka's farm on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. She was born around 21 ABY and became a harvester of purple Surabat grain under the direction of her farmhand group's leader, Jac Lodain, along with her groupmates Shari and a Gungan.\nWhen their former colleague Julen Rakab brought the smuggler Izal Garsea to Saka's farm around 34 ABY, the farmhand group was surprised by her appearance, and impressed that she owned her own starship, the light freighter Meridian. The Sullustan's facial jowls split as she proudly boasted to the visitor that she held the harvesting speed record. Garsea entertained the farmers by relating a tale of how her ship had run out of fuel and was saved by the Frinn Mak Traveling Circus.\nThe farmer appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida CÃ³rdova.",
