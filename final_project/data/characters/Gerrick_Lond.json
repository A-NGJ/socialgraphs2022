 "content": "Gerrick Lond was a male Ishi Tib who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Lond served the Hutt known as Jabba Desilijic Tiure by attending to guests in Jabba's town house on Tatooine. Lond had a nervous tick which caused him to keep saying, \"hm.\"\nGerrick Lond appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Lond would have been on Tatooine. However, Lond is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game, albeit without any clothing.",
