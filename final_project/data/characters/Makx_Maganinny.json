 "content": "Makx Maganinny was a male Human sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic.\nDuring the Battle of Praesitlyn, Makx Maganinny and his squad fought against the invading army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As he watched the army, they were ambushed by battle droids and the sergeant ordered his troops to retreat. During the retreat he came back to a soldier of his squad, Odie Subu, who was threatened by an enemy soldier who shot Maganinny. Sergeant Maganinny was badly wounded and asked Odie, to leave him in order to give his squad enough time to escape. Odie refused to leave him behind, and tried to carry him back to base.",
