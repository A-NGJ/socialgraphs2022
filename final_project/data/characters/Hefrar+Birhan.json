 "content": "Hefrar Birhan was a Human male and barq farmer on Qiilura.\nHe gave Etain Tur-Mukan shelter on his farm after the abduction of Master Kast Fulier. However, he was highly suspicious, anticipating that the Jedi would bring him nothing but trouble, but was persuaded by the Gurlanin Jinart not to turn her over to the local militia led by Ghez Hokan.\nAround one year later the Republic attempted to remove the colonists from Qiilura to keep the Gurlanins on their side. Some colonists refused to leave without a fight, one of which was Birhan who led Etain and several clone troopers into a mine field.",
