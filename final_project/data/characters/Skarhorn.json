 "content": "Skarhorn was a human male who served as a general in the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Skarhorn was present at an Imperial Complex on the planet Garel to open a munitions factory. Skarhorn made a speech declaring the opening of the factory a great day for the Empire, and added that each blaster and thermal detonator produced at the factory would be used against enemies of the Empire. During Skarhorn's speech, an assassin made their way into an All Terrain Scout Transport and aimed its cannons at the general, and informed Skarhorn he would pay for his crimes against innocents. The assassin was thwarted by the Imperial Beilert Valance, but the distraction allowed a second assassin to successfully kill the general.",
