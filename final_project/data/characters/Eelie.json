 "content": "Eelie was a Twi'lek dancer who became, in middle age, a dance teacher for young girls in Kala'uun. Eelie was born into slavery, but earned enough to buy her freedom at a young age. She spent her youth traveling the galaxy, having a long series of wild adventures. One Quarren smuggler, after meeting her, christened his ship the Eelie's Luck.\nAfter settling down somewhat in Kala'uun, Eelie still kept an eye out for exciting, adventurous individuals to hook up with. In addition to being an expert dancer and artist, she was also an impressive slicer, tumbler, con artist, and master of sleight-of-hand.",
