 "content": "Prokreisha was a male Force-sensitive Humanoid who was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. During his service to the Order he ended the Rust plague and fought on the planet Malastare. In recognition of his actions, the people of the planet Vaklin erected a statue of Prokreisha's in a public square in the city of Vaklin Zenith. The statue showed him holding up a lightsaber while wearing robes and a moustache. In the year 19 BBY during an insurgency on Vaklin, led by three Jedi against the newly formed Galactic Empire after the dissolution of the Jedi Order, Prokreisha's statue was destroyed. Prior to its destruction, Imperial Security Bureau Major Oniye Namada asked a citizen of Vaklin to identify the statue, and they responded that it showed a war hero. Its destruction was part of an attempt to wipe out all memory of the Order's existence on Vaklin, and reduce public support for the Insurgency. Namada later mentioned Prokreisha in a report she wrote on the Vaklin insurgency, titled I-1807-VAK.\nProkreisha was first mentioned in Purge â€“ The Tyrant's Fist 2, a comic book written by Alexander Freed and released in 2013 and part of the Star Wars: Purge series. The book does not make clear what era he lived in or what their species.",
