 "content": "Fin Danglot was a starfighter pilot who served in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. By 0 BBY, prior to fellow Rebel pilot Puck Naeco's death during the Battle of Yavin, Naeco was a mentor for Danglot as well as pilots Keyan Farlander and Milar Travis. A Human male, Danglot stood at a height of 1.65 meters. He was equipped with a blaster pistol and a comlink, and he wore the standard Rebel flight suit along with a flight helmet and goggles during his service as a Rebel pilot.\nThe character of Fin Danglot was first mentioned in 1989's first edition of West End Games' Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope. Notably in the same year, the image accompanying the character entry was also used in West End Games' Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back to accompany the entry of another character, Tenk Lenso. Jason Fry considered Fin Danglot as one of several candidates to retcon as the previously unnamed role of Red Twelve during the Battle of Yavin for the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare. He ultimately went with the Puck Naeco character. Nonetheless, both Danglot and Milar Travis were separately included in the book as a shoutout.",
