 "content": "Lieutenant Nizzon was an Imperial officer who served as the First Officer for Captain Plikk on a Star Destroyer during the Galactic Civil War. Nizzon's ship patrolled a remote sector for years with little action, but on one loop in 3 ABY, Nikkon discovered a small rent in the dimensional fabric that aroused great curiosity. Plikk and Nizzon gathered their fleet and blasted the rent open, passing through to discover the City of Dreams, a utopian dreamscape created through psychic energy from former Rebel hero Cody Sunn-Childe. Nizzon's fleet attacked and destroyed the city, but afterwards found that they did not have the hyperdrive power to escape Sunn-Childe's pocket dimension, trapping them there for good.\nNizzon first appeared in Star Wars  46, written by John Marc DeMatteis and released in 1981. In the issue, Nizzon was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
