 "content": "Woyiq was a loud Human male with a large build and connections to the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. He traveled with a Gotal accomplice named Toalar Yalom Yalom and claimed to have be called on by the Imperial presence in Il Avali on Druckenwell to help search the rubble of I'att Armament for survivors.\nThough this may be have been true, his goal at the time was to covertly inform Tinian I'att Azur-Jamin, heiress and fugitive from the weapons complex that no-one had survived the building's explosion. It was a lie planted by Woyiq as a favor to Tinian's lover, Daye Azur-Jamin, a survivor from the blast who felt his \"death\" would unburden her.",
