 "content": "Earnst Kamiel was a Human male Alderaanian who disagreed with his homeworld's pacifist stance during the Galactic Civil War. This led him to establish the Justice Action Network , with the parents of Jan Ors.\nThe JAN organization was an anti-Empire terrorist group, and took an extremist approach to resisting the Empire. It rose to prominence on the planet Findris, around 13 BBY, and rapidly spread through the Colonies Region.\nKamiel was wanted by the Empire for thousands of bombings, and the deaths of up to 10,000 individuals. He was given the death sentence in 54 systems. Kamiel was eventually captured by the Empire in the Elrood sector following the Battle of Yavin, and transferred to Haldeen where he was executed shortly afterwards by a firing squad.",
