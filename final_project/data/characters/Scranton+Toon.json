 "content": "Scranton Toon was a male Rodian pilot working for the pirate, Plook Hartar. He was known to be arrogant and extremely skilled. He lost his left eye in a swoop racing crash and had it replaced with a cybernetic photoreceptor enhancement. He flew a Shock Hauler 33 named the Goonga Munt Goonga.\nHarter and his rival, Servid Norn, devised a race to pit their best pilots against each other in order to determine whose pirate gang had the best pilots in their employ. Norn posted a bounty on Toon to prevent him from participating in the race, thus ensuring his pilot won. The bounty required a live capture so as to not damage any working relationship his organization had with Harter's gang.",
