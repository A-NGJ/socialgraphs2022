 "content": "A Sarkan female pilgrim visited the moon Jedha around 382 BBY. During the journey to the Holy City on a starship, the Sarkan sat next to Jedi Vildar Mac. When Mac had a nightmare about his past, the Sarkan informed him that she had nightmares whilst in hyperspace too, and asked Mac if he was visiting Jedha on a pilgrimage like her. Mac responded that he was arriving for a new posting on Jedha. The pilgrim then expressed her envy at the fact Mac was staying on Jedha, explaining that she was only visiting for a few days, though she planned to visit the Fountains of Plenty, before wishing she could stay longer.",
