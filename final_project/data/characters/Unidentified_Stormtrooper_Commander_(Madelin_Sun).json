 "content": "A human Stormtrooper Commander served in the Galactic Empire during its reign of the galaxy. Between 8 BBY and 2 BBY, the Stormtrooper Commander, accompanied by two other stormtroopers, searched the possessions of the former University of Bar'leth Sava Madelin Sun that she had begun to sell after the fall of the Jedi Order after they were informed by the smuggler Han Solo. Whilst the troopers carried out their search, one discovered an artifact that Sun had possession of, and the commander informed Sun that they would have to report it to the local Imperial governor, as possession of the particular artifact was illegal under Order 66 Codicil Nine. As Sun pleaded with the commander to not report the discovery, the three troopers were killed by Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn.",
