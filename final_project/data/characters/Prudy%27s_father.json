 "content": "The father of Prudy was a male Twi'lek who lived on the planet Coruscant during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. In 3644 BBY, his daughter Prudy was on the planet Ord Mantell when she became engaged to a fellow doctor, a Human named Archiban Kimble. Prudy arranged for her mother and father to travel from Coruscant in order to attend her wedding with Kimble, but the pair's trip was ultimately for naught when Kimble broke off his engagement to Prudy on the day of their wedding. Prudy held a grudge against Kimble for this, and she was still furious with him for making her parents pay for the trip when they spoke two years later.\nPrudy's father was first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, where he is mentioned by his daughter in the conversation \"Best Intentions\" with the Jedi Knight class companion Kimble.",
