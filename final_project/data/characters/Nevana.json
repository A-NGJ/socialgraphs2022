 "content": "Nevana was a female Dubravan and local dweller at the cantina on Dubrava.\nNevana met a drunk Jal Te Gniev, who mentioned that Luke Skywalker was on Jazbina. A secret Rebel supporter, Nevana nevertheless gave the name to the bounty hunter Sarma in exchange for canceling a debt owed by her father, as she did not recognize it and figured him to be a criminal. Sarma betrayed Nevana to the Empire, and she fled to the cantina to ask Gniev what she had done. She was horrified to realize that she had turned in one of the Rebellion's greatest heroes, but did not have time to dwell long on it, as Imperial stormtroopers, tipped off by Sarma, stormed in and shot her in the back.",
