 "content": "Maggis was a teacher in the days before the Galactic Empire. He was a professor of navigation and sublight technology at the Celestial School of Spaceflight Engineering on Argus. When the Empire was established he became an Imperial officer and took a position as a guardian advisor at the Imperial Naval Academy on Coruscant. He soon found out that he didn't like being an Imperial officer and decided to help Trever Flume escape when he was trying to rescue Lune Oddo Divinian. Trevor took him down below the crust on Coruscant and Dexter Jettster helped him become one of the Erased.",
