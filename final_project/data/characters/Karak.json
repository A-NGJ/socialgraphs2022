 "content": "Karak was the male Sedrian bishop of war. He wore a blue armband with an engraved broken shell pattern. He was power hungry, wanting the Golden Sun to himself, and was the leader of a group of renegades. He had a daughter, Fala, and a pet razort, Tooch.\nHe helped the Galactic Empire set the Golden Sun free and stole its power, turning it to the dark side of the Force through his actions, until a group of Alliance agents scattered the pieces of the Golden Sun and cut off his power. He was later arrested and imprisoned for his betrayal.",
