 "content": "Wayniss was the chief pilot of the Poison Moon. He was an aging ex-pirate and smuggler who knew nothing of the Force. He also did not know that those who had been employing him were Sith and would have reacted incuriously if he had. He was known to give good value for his pay and would remain loyal as long as he was paid, making him reliable and dependable in the eyes of Dician.",
