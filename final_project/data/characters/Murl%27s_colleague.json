 "content": "The Human male was a colleague of Murl at the Odionate cloister on Vanahame in 1032 BBY. He and Murl were responsible for maintaining the level of artificial light within the Cloister chambers, which housed thousands of children imprisoned in bubble capsules. During the Battle of Vanahame, he and Murl were ordered to switch off all the lights in the Cloister, plunging into pitch darkness and driving the children into a state of fear and panic.\nThese negative emotions allowed Sith Lord Odion to activate the Helm of Ieldis, an ancient Sith artifact capable of driving sentient beings into a homicidal frenzy. Odion intended to bring a galactic apocalypse but was thwarted by a redeemed Beld Yulan who killed Murl's colleague and forced Murl to switch back on the lights and free the children, ending the Helm's killing frenzy and causing to overload and kill Odion.",
