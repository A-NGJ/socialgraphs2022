 "content": "Chung was a male Ubuugan criminal.\nOne year after the Battle of Yavin, Chung was captured by Boba Fett, who imprisoned him in a cell on the Slave I. On their way to Coruscant, the bounty hunter discovered a lost ship in space, the Mingula. For the exploration of the freighter, he chose to take Chung's cell neighbor, Tsumo, a criminal whose life could be spent, unlike the Ubuugan, who was wanted alive. After the attack of an Ubuugan fleshborer swarm which resulted in Tsumo's death, Fett headed back to the Slave I. He was afraid that the creatures would go for Chung, leaving Fett without any bounty to collect. But when he reached Chung's cell, he was luckily surprised. He found the Ubuugan feasting on the remaining fleshborers. Like all the natives of Ubuuga, Chung developed a natural defense against the deadly parasites, which saved his life and Fett's bounty.",
