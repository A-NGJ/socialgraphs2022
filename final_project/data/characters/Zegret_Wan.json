 "content": "Zegret Wan was a Elomin male who served as the captain of the Ranphyxes smashball team during the Separatist Crisis. In 22 BBY, in only his fourth season, he was close to gaining the smashball accolade of having 50 goals in 50 games. He had already gotten 50 goals in 54 games; his victory against the Belsavis Kretch just before the start of the Clone Wars was his 43rd goal in 35 games.",
