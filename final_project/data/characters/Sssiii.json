 "content": "Sssiii was a male Slith of red coloration, weighing 60 kilograms. He was somehow obtained by the Galactic Circus and toured with them on a number of worlds, including Tatooine. Sssiii had only limited intelligence, corresponding to that of a 10-year-old Human, and was unable to speak to its companions; Sssiii communicated instead by striking the ground with his tail. During circus performances, Sssiii provided entertainment by playing chess against the spectators.\nSssiii appears as a non-player character in the roleplaying adventure Le facteur X, published in Casus Belli. This is a French gaming magazine and it is unknown whether the article went through licensing; therefore Sssiii's canonicity is ambiguous.",
