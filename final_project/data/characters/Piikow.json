 "content": "Piikow was a Chadra-Fan male who operated as a technician for the Dreamers, a successor group to Saw Gerrera's partisans. Piikow was forced to work at an Imperial factory while he believed his family was being held hostage. He toiled in the factory and was exposed to toxic chemicals not knowing that the Empire had already executed his family. By 0 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Piikow had made his way to the Dreamers and worked at their encampment on the planet Jeosyn. When the Dreamers had multiple recruits join them, Piikow became friends with one of them, Del Farren. However, Farren was actually Del Meeko, one of four undercover operatives of the Imperial Special Forces group known as Inferno Squad. In the following months, the double-agents of Inferno Squad killed the Dreamers, including Piikow. Despite serving Inferno Squad, Meeko regretted the Chadra-Fan's death.",
