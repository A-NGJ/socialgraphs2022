 "content": "Dole Happ was a Twi'lek Force Adept, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 31 BBY, Happ attended the SoroSuub Anniversary celebration that was held in the city of Tolea Biqua, on the planet Genarius. During the event, Happ served as an agent of the Force Adept Taleah Novran, who was trying to pair young Force Adepts with suitable mentors.\nRaadun was very lighthearted and found it difficult to take things seriously. He was curious and adventurous and enjoyed going to parties, going on adventures and getting into trouble.",
