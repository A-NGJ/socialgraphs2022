 "content": "Kursk Te'tell was a male Bothan who worked for the Bothan Spynet. Following the devastation of the planet Caamas by the Galactic Empire, in conjunction with a group of Bothan operatives, Te'tell was dispatched to the world to establish Bothan Debris, Incorporated, a front company for the Spynet. Te'tell's role was to monitor the planet so that the Spynet would be alerted if anyone traveled to Caamas to search for clues relating to the world's devastation, and he reported any suspicious activities to his superiors.",
