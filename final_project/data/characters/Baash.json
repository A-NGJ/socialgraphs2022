 "content": "Baash was a male Iktotchi bounty hunter who worked for Graballa the Hutt with his fellow partner, Raam. Under the leadership of the bounty hunter Dengar, he and Raam hunted Rowan Freemaker in order to obtain the Kyber Saber crystals. They later joined up with the Sith agent Naare until she turned on them at the Freemaker Garage.\nBaash and his fellow Iktotchi bounty hunter Raam worked for the Hutt crime lord Graballa following the Battle of Hoth. The two served as Graballa's \"think tank.\" While visiting Graballa's ore mine in the Belgaroth asteroid field, the two encountered Rowan Freemaker and his B1-series battle droid Roger. When Baash and Raam asked what they were doing there, the two quipped that they enjoyed watching the mining droids blow things up. The two then argued about butting heads and locking horns before reconciling.\nReturning to their topic, Baash and Raam then asked Rowan about his presence at the mine. Rowan then pretended that he was the deadliest Ugnaught bounty hunter in the galaxy and claimed that Roger was \"IG-89\". Impressed, Baash and Raam took the two bounty hunters aboard Graballa's flagship Rancor's Fist as prospective bounty hunters. However, Graballa was not interested in hiring more bounty hunters since he already had Dengar in his service. Still, Graballa allowed Rowan and \"IG-89\" to take his place if they could beat Dengar in combat.\nHowever, Dengar defeated the two contenders and unmasked them as Rowan and Roger. Graballa then expressed interest in Rowan's Kyber Saber crystal and demanded that the boy help him find more; believing that they could bankroll his beachside resort and buffet. When Rowan refused, he threatened to feed him to his pet Nexu Smiley. When Roger remarked that he was a droid, Baash responded that Smiley ate anything and exhibited a cracked stormtrooper helmet and Smiley's litter box as evidence.\nBefore Graballa could eliminate Rowan and Roger, Rowan's older sister and brother Kordi and Zander entered the throne room and tried to get Graballa to buy a Z-wing. While Kordi and Zander distracted Graballa, the false Jedi and Sith agent Naare played a mind trick on Baash and Raam to convince them to nap. Following a struggle, the Freemakers and Naare escaped into the Belgaroth asteroid field. Believing that the Kyber Saber crystal would make him richer than his cousin Jabba, Graballa ordered Baash and Raam to hunt down Rowan.\nTogether with Dengar, Baash and Raam traveled to the Wheel, a space station in the Abrion system. Baash and Raam along with several other bounty hunters including IG-88 attended a meeting in the Wheel's Lower Ring where the rebel Lando Calrissian attempted to hire bounty hunters to recover a \"lost treasure\" from Imperial-occupied Cloud City. The bounty hunters declined the offer but Rowan volunteered his crew.\nLater, Baash and Raam were talking about lunch when they reunited with Dengar in the streets of the Lower Ring. Dengar was frustrated at their inability to find Rowan and took offense when one of the Iktotchi told him that nobody was calling him \"diaper head.\" Before Dengar could file his status report with Graballa, Baash and Raam mentioned a \"special job\" on Cloud City. The three bounty hunters traveled to Bespin where they managed to bribe the stormtroopers into letting them enter Cloud City.\nAfter some exploration, Baash, Raam, and Dengar made their way to the carbon-freezing chamber where they encountered the Freemakers and Naare. Dengar snatched the briefcase containing Lando's \"lost treasure\" from Kordi only to have it snatched by Naare, who believed it contained another Kyber Saber crystal. Baash and Raam quickly recognized Rowan, who had been frozen in carbonite. The three bounty hunters then fled Cloud City with the Freemakers and Naare in pursuit.\nBefore they could flee aboard their craft, Zander severed the cable connecting Cloud City's repulsorlift generator. This cause Baash, Raam, and Dengar to slide into the city, which drifted into the depths of Bespin. Following a brief pursuit throughout the halls of Cloud City, the Freemakers and Naare managed to recover the briefcase and Rowan's frozen body. The plummeting gravity caused Baash and his companions to fall into a prison cell. Meanwhile, the Freemakers and Naare escaped back to the Wheel with Lando's \"lost treasure.\" Later, Baash and Raam were chomping on Cloud City prison fare when Dengar discovered the identity of Rowan's family through a stray business card.\nLater, Baash, Raam, and Dengar escaped from Cloud City by hijacking a stolen Cloud car and throwing out the pilot and passenger. The three bounty hunters returned to Graballa's flagship Rancor's Fist where the Hutt crime lord was making a second unsuccessful attempt to solicit a loan from his cousin Jabba. When Graballa asked them where they had been, Dengar responded that they had been in jail and chastised Graballa for not responding to their calls. Dengar then presented the Freemakers' business card and identified their target as Rowan Freemaker.\nUsing this information, Graballa set a trap for the Freemakers by getting the podracing pilot Ben Quadinaros to invite them to Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine under the pretext of servicing his podracer. Baash, Raam, and Dengar accompanied Graballa when he cornered the Freemakers at Ben's garage. Before Graballa could question Rowan, Jabba entered the garage flanked by several Gamorrean guards and the bounty hunter Boba Fett. While Baash and his fellow bounty hunters were engrossed in conversation with Fett, the Freemakers took the opportunity to escape on a podracer.\nUnder Graballa's orders, Baash, Raam, and Dengar pursued the fugitives on speeder bikes. During the 29th Annual Bricklayers' Classic race, Baash and Raam attempted to ram the Freemaker podracer with their bikes but Zander sped up, causing the two bikes to collide into each other. Dengar tried to pursue the Freemakers but was outwitted by them. Following the race, the Freemakers fled into the Dune Sea. Graballa dispatched his henchmen including Baash and Raam after the fugitives and they cornered the Freemakers at a derelict sandcrawler.\nWhile laying siege to the Freemakers, Graballa apologised to Baash and his fellow bounty hunters for trying to hire Boba Fett because of their incompetence. The Freemakers managed to scatter Graballa's henchmen by throwing thermal detonators. After the Freemakers ran out of thermal detonators, Graballa ordered his henchmen to storm the sandcrawler. However, Naare arrived and used her lightsaber and Force powers to attack Baash and the other henchmen. During the struggle, Baash and Raam managed to capture Zander but were driven away by Naare. Naare and the Freemakers then escaped on her ship Eclipse Fighter. Naare also blew up their skiff, leaving Graballa and all his henchmen stranded.\nBaash and his associates followed Graballa to the Freemaker Garage in the Wheel only to discover that the Freemakers had already fled. Instead, they found the Sith Naare, who claimed that she had a way to track down the Freemakers. Graballa and Naare sealed their partnership by agreeing to share half of the Kyber Saber crystals. Using the Battle droid Roger's transmission pack as a homing beacon, Naare managed to steal the fourth, fifth, and sixth Kyber Saber crystals from Rowan. Following a confrontation on Zoh, Graballa and Naare raced the Freemakers to the planet Hoth, where the seventh crystal lay.\nBaash and Raam flew with Dengar in the latter's starfighter during a pursuit through Hoth's stormy atmosphere. Blinded by the snow storm, Dengar crashed his starfighter into a mountain. Naare and Graballa's ships also collided with the mountain but the Freemakers managed to escape. Baash survived the crash and joined Raam, Yeppau, and several other henchmen in digging Graballa's ship Rancor's Fist out of the snow. After some difficulty, Naare learned that the Freemakers were hiding at the former rebel base Echo Base.\nDuring the assault, Baash, Raam, and Dengar flew in their starfighter. The fighter was quickly knocked out of action when Rowan and Zander's snowspeeder ripped off the canopy of their ship; causing them to crash. Naare managed to force the Freemakers to retreat after she summoned an avalanche with toppled Kordi and Roger's AT-AT walker. After the Freemakers fled into a cave, Naare issued an ultimatum offering Rowan and his family safe passage if they surrendered the seventh Kyber Saber crystal. Rowan instead sent them an ice crystal before fleeing into hyperspace with his family. Baash and his colleagues were present when Naare attempted to reforge the Kyber Saber only for it to shatter.\nFollowing the debacle on Hoth, Baash along with Graballa and his fellow henchmen were present aboard the Rancor's Fist when Naare threw a tantrum and used the Force to hurl them against a wall. Later, Baash and his fellow henchmen accompanaimed Graballa and Naare to the Freemaker Garage where they cornered Kordi and Zander. In an attempt to force Rowan out of hiding, Naare tortured them by destroying their prized possessions. This ruse succeeded in drawing Rowan and Roger out of hiding but the young Jedi put up a fierce fight and managed to free his siblings.\nDuring the skirmish, Baash and Raam exchanged fire with Kordi. Zander managed to trap them using a magnetizer, which grabbed their blasters. Graballa attempted to get the two bounty hunters to drop their blasters but they refused. At that point, Zander fired a gas canister into Graballa, which caused the Hutt to crash into Baash and Raam. Despite Rowan's fierce resistance, Naare gained the upper hand when she learned that Roger knew the location of the seventh Kyber Saber crystal. Baash and his fellow henchmen were triumphant when Naare bested the Freemakers.\nHowever, their triumph was short-lived when Naare refused to honor her initial agreement to share half of the Kyber Saber crystals with Graballa. She then used the Force to summon debris and drive Graballa and all his henchmen out of the Freemaker Garage.\nBaash, Raam, Dengar, and Graballa later traveled to the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. By that stage, Naare had reformed the Kyber Saber and made a failed bid to overthrow the Emperor. However, Rowan stole the Kyber Saber from her and escaped into hyperspace with his family. Naare attempted to flee the Emperor only to be captured by Baash and his companions who fastened chains on her hands. As punishment, Naare was frozen in carbonite. Under Graballa's orders, Baash, Raam and Yeppau struggled to erect Naare's frozen body on a wall aboard Graballa's throne room.\nBaash, Raam and Yeppau accompanied Graballa on his visit to the Mygeeto Auction House. Graballa wanted to find investors for his beachside resort and buffet among the wealthy nobles. While Graballa and Yeppau headed to the luxury terrace, Baash and Raam went to the buffet. Baash and Raam obtained Mygeeto burritos and entered the auctioning hall. Raam accidentally bid for the Theta-class H-2 executive star shuttle. Raam's actions infuriated Graballa, who was forced to fork out 75,000 Credits on an unwanted ship. Back at the Rancor's Fist, Graballa lambasted his two henchmen and chastised Boba Fett for not babysitting them.\nShortly later, Kordi Freemaker, who was disguised as Princess Alo Kortessi, entered the Rancor's Fist and attempted to exchange an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor for Graballa's unwanted shuttle. Graballa instead kidnapped her as part of a plot to extort money from the Clawdite royal family. While Graballa tried to contact the Clawdite royal family, Baash hoisted \"Princess Kortessi\". While Dengar led a squadron of starfighters to deal with Kordi's brothers Zander and Rowan, Baash and Raam stayed aboard the Rancor's Fist. Offering her services as a business adviser, \"Kortessi\" managed to convince Graballa to designate Baash and Raam as liabilities or dependents. Kordi subsequently led Graballa to the Rancor's Fist's hangar where they were joined by Zander and Rowan, who had arrived in the Jedi interceptor and the StarScavenger respectively.\nAfter Kordi chained Graballa, Graballa asked for help only for Baash to remind that he had fired many of his staff through the airlock at Kordi's advice. When Baash and Raam tried to seize the Freemakers, Zander hurled a container at both of them. Following a brief skirmish with Dengar, the Freemakers managed to escape aboard the shuttle and the StarScavenger. When Graballa demanded that Baash and Raam stop the intruders, the two bounty hunters went on strike and demanded that Graballa discuss compensation packages with them. They were joined by Dengar, who complained about the work environment.\nBaash and Raam later aided Graballa's mining operation. They used explosives to blow up a rock-face, allowing several DLC-13 mining droids to enter the mine. When Graballa requested a report, Baash informed him that they had preliminary numbers with Raam finishing off that they found no kyber crystals. Seeking to use Rowan to lead them to more kyber crystals, Graballa attempted to capture Rowan at the Wheel but the Freemakers managed to escape.\nAs an Iktotchi, Baash had a humanoid form and two large horns. He and his fellow Iktotchi Raam were bounty hunters who liked to crack jokes. He was susceptible to mind tricks. Baash and Raam liked to talk about mundane topics like mining droids and lunch. Baash liked to eat hamburgers. Baash and Raam were also friendly and naive. This naivety was exploited by Rowan, who concocted up a story to explain his and Roger's presence at Graballa's ore mine in the Belgaroth asteroid field.\nBaash also had a fear of heights. He could ride a speeder bike but was outmanoeuvred by Zander. He and Raam were able to take down Zander in physical combat but were no match for the Force powers of Naare. He and Raam also had some experience as co-pilots flying with the bounty hunter Dengar, who was their natural leader. Baash could also fire a blaster and was unwilling to let his go when he and Raam were trapped by a magnetizer.\nBaash regarded Graballa as a poor reader while Graballa disliked Baash and Raam for their incompetence. Baash and Raam had poor working relations with their employer Graballa and once went on strike.\nBaash was a minor antagonist created for the 2016–2017 Disney XD animated television series LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures. He was voiced by John DiMaggio.",
