 "content": "Kurline was a Quarren shipping manager and the administrator of the Sailor's Union Landing Union chapter circa 29 BBY.\nCirca 29 BBY, the Sailor's Union was a strong institution in the planet Lamaredd. Its headquarters in Farsands, capital city of Little Mon Cal, was managed by the crafty shipping manager Kurline, a Quarren.\nKurline was well-liked and supported, as he fought for the rights of the sailors. He also met with Union members whenever anyone asked, and sometimes interviewed potential new members. Sometimes, Kurline accepted bribes.\nKurline was familiar with information about the Union and about Lamaredd. He was fluent in Chagri, Galactic Basic Standard, Mon Calamarian, and Quarrenese.\nKurline liked expensive clothes. He commonly carried with him a comlink, a credstick, and a datapad. His weapons of choice were a knife and a hold-out slugthrower.",
