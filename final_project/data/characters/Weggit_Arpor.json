 "content": "Weggit Arpor was a male Human who represented the Tenloss Syndicate's operations within the Vergesso Asteroids, though he had once been a smuggling boss who worked for Ororo Transportation. To most people, he was known as Nim Zanti's chief lieutenant, however, this was actually a cover for his role as a Tenloss Syndicate officer. His primary duty was to make sure that Zanti kept in line with the Syndicate's plans.\nSome time later, Weggit left the Syndicate to work for Galindas Exports as a logistics expert.",
