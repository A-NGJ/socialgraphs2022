 "content": "Toral was an ancient Coynite leader, at a time when the Coynite species was veering dangerously toward extinction. He was considered the strongest and most influential member of his clan. Through a series of reforms, Toral managed to unite the Coynite species under a single leader, banish the use of biological weapons, and create the En'Tra'Sol law system. These acts led to a more stabilized civilization on the planet Coyn, and paved the way for future generations to come. His son, Arl'Toral, followed closely in his footsteps, and brought peace to the planet.",
