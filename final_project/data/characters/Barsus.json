 "content": "Barsus was a diminutive male Near-Human who lived in the Cularin system during the waning years of the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring the SoroSuub Anniversary celebration in the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius in 31 BBY, Barsus participated in a number of drinking contests in the Tolea Biqua franchise of Vanster Enan's Sop House. Barsus was able to win most of the contests by cheating, as he had an IV drip of purifying agents concealed in a pouch and connected to his femoral artery.\nAt some point afterwards, Barsus was present in Vanster Enan's Sop House in the city of Gadrin on the planet Cularin, during the celebrations surrounding the Cularin Swamp Run, a local podracing event. He participated in drinking contests and used the same method of cheating as he had done on Genarius.",
