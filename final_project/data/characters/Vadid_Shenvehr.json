 "content": "Lieutenant Vadid Shenvehr was a hangar controller who worked at Byblos Starport Tower 214 hangar 217-11. He was impartial in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Galactic Empire.\nShenvehr was knowledgeable in all aspects of Imperial flight regulations and Byblos traffic regulations. He was also a fully qualified pilot. He didn't care who won the Galactic Civil War as long as they didn't disrupt his hangar operations.\nShenvehr was a dedicated worker, often spending time in the hangar even when he wasn't scheduled.",
