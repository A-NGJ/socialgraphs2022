 "content": "Bandor Ootka was a male Aqualish spy who served the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. At some point during the conflict, Ootka stayed at a Separatist safe-house on the planet of Clak'dor VII while on leave from a Techno Union starship. While he was in the house, Ootka was visited by the Duros weapon smuggler Doon Gorot, who was acting as a go-between for a crime lord who was working for the Separatists. The pair discussed a weapons shipment that was ready for the Separatists to collect from Mezhra Station, a space station that orbited Clack'dor VII, and Ootka paid Gorot 500,000 for the consignment.",
