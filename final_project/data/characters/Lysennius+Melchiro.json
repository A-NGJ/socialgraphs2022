 "content": "Lysennius Melchiro was a male Human politician who was appointed governor of Balmorra by the reconstituted Sith Empire following the Great Galactic War. However, his inept leadership allowed the Balmorran resistance to gain too much of a foothold, prompting the Dark Council to send Darth Lachris to take charge. Disgusted by his weakness, Lachris Force choked the governor to death, and assumed control of Balmorra herself.\nGovernor Melchiro is only seen briefly while being Force-choked by Darth Lachris. The dark side option is to do nothing while Lachris kills him, while the light side option involves speaking up, thus saving his life. The article implies the dark side option to be canon.",
