 "content": "Sam Waurie was the son of a famous Corporate Sector Authority Security Division executive.\nSam never aspired to reach the height his father achieved, and instead worked in a series of dead-end jobs contentedly for many years, during the era of the New Order. He showed great promise as a programmer, but chose to remain a drudge. He was a dreamer, and often found himself dreaming of heroic, romantic, melodramatic deeds.",
