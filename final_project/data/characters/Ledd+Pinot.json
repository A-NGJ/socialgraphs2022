 "content": "Ledd Pinot was a male Human who served as a guard in Desolation Alley around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.\nIn 32 BBY, Pinot was on duty during the uprising caused by Zam Wesell when she was on the hunt for Bendix Fust. He was wanted by the Hutts for skimming profits in a smuggling operation. A bounty worth 4,000 credits dead or alive was placed on his head. This bounty was claimed by Jango Fett who also was looking for Bendix Fust.\nLedd Pinot is the first, out of five bounties to encounter in the first Oovo IV level. It is unclear which way Jango Fett claimed the bounty as it is the same reward either way.",
