During the war he worked as a merchant on the planet Nal Hutta, the adopted homeworld of Hutt species. Whilst at the stall the man wore armor himself and a blaster pistol on his hip. Hurdoc had blonde hair which he wore with a braid and included a moustache, brown eyes and pale skin. His right eye had been replaced with a cybernetic implant sometime prior to 3643 BBY.\nHurdoc first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
