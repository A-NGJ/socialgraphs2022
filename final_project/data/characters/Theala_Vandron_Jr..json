 "content": "Theala Vandron was the Lady of House Vandron in 12 ABY. Theala was described as heavyset and stately.\nShe had been called to appear before the New Republic Court of Justice that same year over charges of planet-stripping and violations of the Rights of Sentience. This stemmed from the fact that she was allowing slavers to run breeding farms on her homeworld, while at the same time she had met with Roganda and Irek Ismaren about bringing the Eye of Palpatine to Belsavis. When the plan failed Roganda and Irek escaped using her own personal starship.",
