 "content": "Kharl was a Naboo human male who was a member of the Torada Collective, an organization of artists who felt they did not fit in on the planet Naboo. Suffering from a medical condition which caused him chronic pain and required him to use leg braces and crutches, Kharl chose to live away from Naboo as the planet's laws banned medicinal spice which alleviated his pain. In 22 BBY, at the onset of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Kharl was one of five members of the Torada Collective living on Nooroyo, a spice-producing planet which joined the Separatists. As Naboo remained a member of the Republic, the families of the artists, including Queen Jamillia, wanted their relatives home, and Jamillia sent Senator Padm√© Amidala to retrieve them. Citing his medical condition, Kharl chose to remain on Nooroyo, but advised Amidala to make her visit brief due to the presence of her enemy, Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who was visiting the planet.",
