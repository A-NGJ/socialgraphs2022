 "content": "Ralthar Sitan, known as Snout, was a male Caamasi who was kept as a slave by the organization called the Crucible around the time of the Mandalorian Wars. Forced to brutal fights despite his peaceful nature, he was able to experience centuries of the Crucible's cruelty through memnii from other Caamasi. In 3963 BBY, on Volgax, he let Zayne Carrick to see the Crucible's history through memnii, after he was defeated in the fight. However, soon the two were forced into another fight, in which Snout deliberately left a hole in his defense, allowing Carrick to kill him and stop his suffering.",
