 "content": "Carrack was a large Human male who lived on Dathomir in the aftermath of the Second Galactic Civil War. When Han and Leia Solo traveled into Dathomir's wilderness to find Luke and Ben Skywalker, Carrack was hired as one of their guides. They found the Skywalkers and joined them in attending the conclave of the Raining Leaves and Broken Columns Clans. However, the conclave was sabotaged by multiple Nightsister attacks, and Carrack was severely injured during one such attack. He was forced to return to the spaceport for medical treatment.",
