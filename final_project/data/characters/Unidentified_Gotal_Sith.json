 "content": "A Gotal male Sith with brown hair, yellow eyes, and red–and–black tattood skin was a member of the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Sith Order in 130 ABY. In that year, Krayt ordered his Hand Darth Nihl to lead a group of Sith in an attack on the Jedi Temple on Ossus, and the Gotal joined Nihl's strike team, which had specifically been tasked with leaving no Jedi alive. During the attack, the Gotal, Nihl, and more of their comrades confronted the Jedi Masters Kol Skywalker and Wolf Sazen. The two Masters killed many Sith, but the Gotal and several others fought on as Cade Skywalker, Kol's son, rushed into the fray to aid his father. After Cade fled with an injured Sazen, Nihl slew Kol with Force lightning, and the Jedi Order became scattered and broken.\nThe Gotal Sith was one of many Sith warriors who appeared as background characters in the first issue of the Star Wars: Legacy comic-book series. The issue was written by John Ostrander, illustrated by Jan Duursema, and published by Dark Horse Comics on June 21, 2006.",
