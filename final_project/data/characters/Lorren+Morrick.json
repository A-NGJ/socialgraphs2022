She had lost many friends and colleagues in battle, but she kept fighting for the Alliance to Restore the Republic because she believed in the Alliance's cause.\nDr. Morrick helped tend to the wounded Soldiers throughout the Ardan Resistance's adventures throughout the Outer and Mid Rim territories.",
