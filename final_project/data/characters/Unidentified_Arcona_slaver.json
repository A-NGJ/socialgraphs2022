 "content": "In 3627 BBY, a male Arcona slaver handled a trade agreement with The Brothers slaver organization aboard the space station Mek-Sha. He was then neutralized along with the other slavers by an individual affiliated with the Galactic Republic.\nThe Arcona slaver appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught. He is featured in the secondary and heroic quest \"Breaking the Yoke\" for Republic-aligned players. After his defeat in combat, the player has a choice to deliver him to the Republic authorities, execute him to acquire dark side points, or to let him go for light side points.\n]",
