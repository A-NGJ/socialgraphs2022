 "content": "Kras'dohk was a rogue male Trandoshan Jedi Master who wandered the galaxy in the time before the Ruusan Reformation of the Galactic Republic.\nA rare Force-sensitive Trandoshan, Kras'dohk was raised at the Coruscant Jedi Temple from infancy, trained at the academy there until he achieved the rank of Jedi Knight, and later, Jedi Master. Living in a time when the Jedi Order was suffering from schisms and wars with the Sith, Kras'dohk departed from Coruscant and began a journey mission along the Outer Rim Territories that would cause him to lose contact with the Jedi High Council.\nSeparate from the goings-on within the Galactic Republic, Master Kras'dohk came across a Force-sensitive Kaminoan named Kina Ha and offered to train the centuries old woman in the ways of the Jedi. Reporting back to the High Council about his new apprentice, the Order decided to recognize the woman's training and acknowledged her as a Knight once her training was completed, though they did not approve of him taking a Padawan. While Kina Ha went on to continue her master's mission of aiding the less fortunate on the Outer Rim, Master Kras'dohk succumbed to old age and became one with the Force.",
