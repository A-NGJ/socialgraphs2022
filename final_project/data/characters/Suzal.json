 "content": "Suzal was a Human male member of the Five, a reclusive evil-worshipping cult that lived within the region of space known as the Hellhoop. The vocal leader of the Five, Suzal and his fellows spent centuries aboard their warship torturing and killing unfortunate travelersâ€”notably, they captured and imprisoned Wutzek, the last known living Force demon. The Five also captured Rebel leaders Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia Organa sometime during the Galactic Civil War. Suzal took a particular interest in breaking Solo's spirit through psychological torment, only for Chewbacca to free Wutzek, which swept through the ship and brutally killed every member of the Five.\nSuzal appeared in The Pandora Effect, a 1981 comic story written by Alan Moore and published in The Empire Strikes Back Monthly 151. In the story, Suzal was drawn by Adolfo Buylla.",
