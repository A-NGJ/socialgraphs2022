 "content": "The mother of Affie Hollow was a human female who was in indentured servitude to the Byne Guild and its leader, Scover Byne. She was in a relationship with Hollow's father, and the two of them piloted the starship Kestrel's Dive for the Guild. Hollow's parents were given incentives to take on dangerous jobs to shorten their indentures, in violation of Galactic Republic laws, which included utilizing the Amaxine space station. This led to their deaths when Hollow was a child, as their ship was destroyed when they attempted to fuel up with the unstable helix rings in the station's lower levels. Afterwards, Hollow was adopted by Byne, who groomed her to take over the Guild but kept her in the dark about the organization's indentured workers. Hollow found out about the circumstances of her parents' deaths and their indentured status when she was seventeen years old in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster.",
