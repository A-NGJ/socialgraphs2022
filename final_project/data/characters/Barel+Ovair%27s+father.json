 "content": "The father of Barel Ovair was said to be a Sith spy of the Sith Empire ostensibly operating as a Jedi historian of the Jedi Order. He visited the tomb of a deceased Sith Lord in order to eliminate it as a threat prior to the invasion of the Galactic Republic. His role and duties were inherited from his father and were passed on to his son, Barel Ovair. Jedi historian Gnost-Dural was the first to discover the true loyalties of the Ovair line, over a century after Barel Ovair's mission to Yavin 4 in 3756 BBY.\nBarel Ovair's father was first introduced in a timeline entry for the Star Wars: The Old Republic video game.",
