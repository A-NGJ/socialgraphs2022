 "content": "A short, wrinkled Duros male served as a loadmaster in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army and was stationed aboard the Acclamator-class assault ship Implacable in 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Hours after the First Battle of Geonosis, the loadmaster was directing clone troopers on the Outer Rim planet Geonosis onto gunships, which were transporting the weary and wounded troopers onto the Implacable.\nWhile the ill-natured Duros barked commands at the troopers, he had a short exchange with clone commando RC-1136 \"Darman,\" who was waiting for his squadmates. The loadmaster irritably ordered Darman aboard the gunships without his squad, to which the commando responded by placing his vibroblade under the loadmaster's chin. After the exchange, the Duros quickly became submissive to the clone, referring to him as \"sir\" and treating him with a newfound deference.\nThe loadmaster appeared in the 2004 novel Hard Contact, the first novel in the Republic Commando series written by Karen Traviss.",
