 "content": "Mambo Farls was a male Human who worked as a designer on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nFarls was married to Gelly Farls and worked for Uniformal Attire, a company that designed and produced corporate Uniforms. In about 32 BBY, he was tasked with developing a new uniform for security staff at the company Culpharm. He spent two and a half months working on the project, eventually developing a distinct green-and-gold-colored uniform. However, he discussed the project with his wife and she took some of the uniforms and gave them to Biotherapy, a rival of Culpharm.\nFarls was a very bouncy and enthusiastic person.",
