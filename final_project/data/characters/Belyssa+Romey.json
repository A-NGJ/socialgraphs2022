 "content": "A Human female, Belyssa Romey served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. Having achieved the rank of Major, she served as an officer in the 132nd Forward Division, which was stationed in the Atrivis sector.\nRomey had blonde hair and fair skin. She was a passionate supporter of the Rebel Alliance and firmly asserted that the Rebels were not traitors, but rather \"freedom fighters.\"\nDuring her time with the 132nd Forward Division, Romey wielded a DH-17 blaster pistol and wore a uniform typical of a fleet trooper, consisting of a blue shirt, black combat vest, gray trousers, black, calf-length boots and a helmet.\nBelyssa Romey was mentioned in Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition, published by West End Games in 1997.",
