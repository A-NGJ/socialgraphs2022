 "content": "Captain Koh was a male Twi'lek and senior officer in Corellian Engineering Corporation. He was primarily in charge of CEC's asteroid mining activities in the Kashyyyk system, but also oversaw CEC's activities on a few other systems. He had a militaristic attitude and demanded discipline and obedience from his employees. However, if they did their jobs well, he would give them substantial rewards including credits and various asteroid mining upgrades for their ships.",
