 "content": "Groj was a male Zabrak Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Tan-skinned with brown eyes, dark brown hair, and brown tattoos across his face, Groj wore dark robes with white armor and carried a single lightsaber. He was assigned to Carrick Station, the Republic Navy's center of operations, where he equipped Jedi Knights with gear.\nGroj first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, as a vendor who sold PVP gear for the Jedi Knight class. Groj originally sold Battlemaster gear, but with the release of Game Update 2.0 on April 9, the PvP commendation system was simplified, condensing most of the different gear levels into a new system. As a result, he was reclassified, and his gear and that of similar vendors often changes with new tiers of gear. He was later removed entirely in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
