 "content": "Korrkoressk was a male Trandoshan who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKorrkoressk was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Korrkoressk spawned under the generic \"thug\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of thirty-five possible depictions. Species Korrkoressk could appear as included Aqualish, Bothans, Bith, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak of either gender. Because the quest dialogue identified Korrkoressk as a male Trandoshan, this article assumes that one of the two randomly generated male Trandoshan depictions is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
