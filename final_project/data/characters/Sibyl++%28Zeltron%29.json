 "content": "Sibyl was the Zeltron wife of Demagol. She lived at some point between the Great Sith War and the Mandalorian Wars. She became involved in Demagol's research, the goal of which was to create Force-sensitive children at his school on Osadia. The two eventually had a daughter, named Chantique. Wyrick, however, was more interested in the Force-attuned Arkanian offsprings than in his own daughter. Seeing her as a failure, Wyrick willingly gave Chantique to The Crucible, a slaving organization. The grief of losing her daughter caused Sibyl to commit suicide.",
