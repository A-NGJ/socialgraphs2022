 "content": "Kal'Falnl C'ndros  was a female Quor'sav trader.\nKal'Falnl C'ndros was a 3.5 meter tall freelance pilot, whose size required her to own a custom-built ship, the Shelltooth, with corridors tall enough to accommodate her. She was widely regarded as being an overprotective mother, and her maternal instincts included not only her own eggs but also her clients and friends, especially the Bimm trader Rycar Ryjerd.\nFor a time after picking him up at a stopover on Yuvern, C'ndros trained the young Yuvernian Cane Adiss how to pilot starships. They visited dozens of worlds before going their separate ways on Tatooine.\nShe was present in Mos Eisley while Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were selling Luke's old X-34 landspeeder to Vuvrian alien Wioslea .\nC'ndros was one of the smugglers contacted by Mal Biron to transport one of several mysterious packages from Sriluur to an undisclosed location. As the sole crewmember aboard the Shelltooth, she felt somewhat disadvantaged, seeking out help from several other smugglers also contacted by Biron. Whether they assisted her is unknown, though it is known that C'ndros was one of the earliest arrivals at the first checkpoint, near the Novolek Beacon.",
