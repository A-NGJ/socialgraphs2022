 "content": "ZG-35 was the callsign of an Imperial TIE/LN starfighter pilot who almost killed Leia Organa in 1 ABY. It was ZG-35 who killed the Rebel agent Hume. At this time he was directly under Darth Vader's command.\nWhen a Star Destroyer under the command of Darth Vader encountered an unidentified space shuttle in Quadrant T2/5/Zero, Vader suspected it might be a Rebel craft and ordered the launch of TIE fighter ZG-35 to investigate the matter. ZG-35 confirmed that it was indeed a Rebel shuttle and was ordered to disable it by Vader.\nAboard the shuttle were Leia Organa and Hume. When ZG-35 started firing upon the shuttle, Hume suggested that Organa escape in a gossamer glider. When Organa refused, Hume knocked her unconscious and sent her off to relative safety on Phelarion. Moments later, ZG-35 fired a salvo that caused the shuttle to explode, thereby killing Hume who was still aboard.\nZG-35 did not notice the gossamer glider heading for Phelarion. Moreover, he had been ordered to only disable the shuttle and not to destroy it.",
