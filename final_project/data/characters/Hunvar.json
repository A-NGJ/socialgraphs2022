 "content": "Hunvar was a Hutt slaver based in Kala'uun on Ryloth. The floor of his residence's dining hall had a hole through which spectators could watch slaves engaged in combat for their entertainment. Hunvar was rumored to be in possession of a lost Jedi holocron, but this was in fact a hoax promulgated by slavery opponents in an attempt to publicize the plight of enslaved Twi'lek females.",
