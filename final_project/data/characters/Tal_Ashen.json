 "content": "Tal Ashen was male Human who served as an officer of the Imperial Military during the Galactic Civil War.\nEmperor Palpatine hand-picked General Ashen to command the Coruscant Defense Forces and the Elite Force defending the Imperial Palace.\nIn 7 ABY, when the New Republic launched its assault to capture Coruscant, General Ashen's ability to defend the Palace was challenged. Despite several All Terrain Armored Transports, a legion of the Emperor's finest troops, a squad of Royal Guards, advanced starfighter support and a series of defensive positions, Ashen was defeated by the New Republic forces led by Generals Rand Talor and Han Solo. During the battle, Ashen's All Terrain Armored Transport was brought to the ground. Somehow, he climbed out ready to fight on the ground, but was soon killed on the street.\nAshen's portrait in the game interface is actually a photograph of Firmus Piett.",
