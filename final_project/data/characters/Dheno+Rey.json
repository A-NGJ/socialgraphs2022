 "content": "Dheno Rey was a Zabrak male who lived during the Cold War.\nDheno Rey was a male Zabrak. According to Rey, he encountered the pirate known as the Red Blade on the planet Hoth. Rey also claimed the Blade owed him credits.\nDuring the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, an agent of Imperial Intelligence, disguised as the Red Blade, visited the planet Hutta to convince Nem'ro the Hutt to ally with the Empire. Rey heard about the \"Red Blade\" visiting Hutta, and later encountered the imposter inside Nem'ro's Palace. He told the agent they didn't resemble the Red Blade, whom Rey claimed owed him credits, and demanded a payment to keep from revealing they were an impostor. The Imperial Agent refused and killed Rey.\nThis article assumes dark side options are chosen, meaning the agent kills Dheno Rey.\nHe can be flirted with by a female Imperial agent, as a result he neither blows the agent's cover nor ends up killed.",
