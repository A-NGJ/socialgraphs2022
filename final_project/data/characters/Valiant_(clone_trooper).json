 "content": "\"Valiant\" was the nickname of an Advanced Recon Commando who held the rank of commander within the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY, during the war's final days, the Clone Commander was stationed on the Republic capital world of Coruscant, where he was assigned to a task force of clone troopers under the command of High Jedi General Mace Windu.\nIn the hunt for Darth Sidious, he led the troopers of Aurek Team. He and his squad accompanied Mace Windu and Shaak Ti during their search for Sidious in the LiMerge Building in The Works. Their search led to the lower levels of 500 Republica, where Valiant remained as the invasion of Coruscant began.\nThere, they discovered Sidious. He and his squad were killed beneath 500 Republica by Geonosians armed with sonic blasters and droids armed with blasters, guarding the Sith Lord. The Sith Lord also used the Force against Aurek Team.",
