 "content": "CS-1004, nicknamed \"Kano,\" was a clone trooper sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He served in the closing stages of the Battle of Ryloth under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. During his time on Ryloth, Sergeant Kano was assigned a squad of inexperienced \"shinie\" troops to accompany him into combat. The sergeant was not particularly fond of watching over the rookies, a task he referred to as \"babysitting.\"\nLike all of his clone trooper brethren in the Grand Army of the Republic, CS-1004—nicknamed \"Kano\"—was a clone of the male Human bounty hunter Jango Fett. Kano served as a sergeant in the Clone Wars, fighting for the Republic against the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. By the Battle of Ryloth, Kano had become a veteran of numerous engagements.\nApproximately 21 BBY, Kano participated in cleanup actions after the Battle of Ryloth, confronting the remaining battle droids left on the planet after the Separatists' defeat. The sergeant was assigned a squad of rookie troops to aid him in combat; however, Kano was not fond of looking after them, a task he called \"babysitting.\"\nSergeant Kano first appeared in 2009's Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes, his only appearance to date, as a playable character during a mission to Ryloth.",
