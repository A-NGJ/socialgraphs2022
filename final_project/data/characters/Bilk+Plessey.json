 "content": "Bilk Plessey was a Rodian male dejarik player who was ranked top in the galaxy. During the Galactic Dejarik Association Championship Tournament, hosted at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana, Plessey challenged Kanata herself. Plessey was put up against Kanata in the final match, in which he played with his arms bound behind his back to prove his ability. He won the tournament, though Kanata won one hundred thousand credits from betting on Plessey playing without his arms.",
