 "content": "Jovan was a male human who served in the military forces of the Galactic Empire in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin. He used his station within the Imperial military to enrich his own life, which resulted in his arrest by his former friend, Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau.\nYears prior to the Battle of Yavin, Jovan joined the Galactic Empire, the tyrannical regime created by Emperor Palpatine at the end of the Clone Wars. He traveled to the planet of Coruscant, seat of the Imperial government, to attend the main Imperial Academy. Once there, Jovan met Kallus, who also wanted to join that institution. The two men took some of the same classes and formed a bond of friendship, with Jovan acting as an informal mentor to his comrade. Kallus would later recall that, without Jovan's help, he may have never graduated at all.\nAfter completing his academy schooling, Jovan became a full-fledged member of the Galactic Empire. At some point, he was stationed on the world of Garel, where he started playing the Imperial system to his advantage, securing riches for himself. In the meantime, Kallus had joined the Imperial Security Bureau , whose members were tasked with rooting out dissidents.\nAfter Jovan, now a lieutenant, was transferred to the Academy of Lothal, his former comrade Kallus was ordered to bring him into custody. Jovan somehow learned of Kallus' orders, and he managed to escape the Academy despite the intervention of Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko's military personnel. Having stolen a TIE fighter from the Academy's hangar, the lieutenant fled to the Lothal settlement of Dinar. Kallus, however, successfully tracked down his former friend, and the two engaged in a duel down an alleyway. Jovan ran away once again, but Kallus went after him, intent on bringing him to face justice. What started as a chase through the streets of Dinar ended up as a flying pursuit as Jovan and Kallus each piloted a TIE Fighter over the green plains of Lothal. Eventually, Jovan was taken down, tricked by a maneuver he had taught to Kallus when they were still friends. The rebellious lieutenant asked for Kallus' mercy, but the ISB agent refused to let him go. Jovan was taken away to be imprisoned.\nA male human with fair skin and golden eyes, Jovan had brown hair, which he wore medium long in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin. By that time, he had also lost the use of his left eye, which was covered by an eyepatch.\nAlthough he had initially joined the Empire with the same set of ideals as Kallus, Jovan ended up thinking differently. By the time he was stationed on Garel, he had started playing the system, convinced that the Imperial doctrine was all about ensuring one's own wealth rather than bringing order to the masses.\nAs an Imperial officer, Jovan knew how to use a blaster, and was also trained in unarmed combat. Since his Academy days, Jovan preferred to operate under the shroud of secrecy. Although flying was never his specialty, he compensated it by his outstanding shooting abilities. When he and Kallus were studying together, Jovan always got the upper hand in the many war games they played.\nAs a lieutenant, Jovan wore a gray-green Imperial uniform, a pair of black boots, and gauntlet gloves. His belt was fitted with an identity disk. The metallic rank insignia on the left breast of his tunic comprised four tiles, two red over two blue. The lieutenant also carried an SE-14r light repeating blaster.",
