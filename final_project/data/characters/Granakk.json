 "content": "Granakk was a female Wookiee who was exiled by her species from her homeworld of Kashyyyk. After her banishment from her home planet, Granakk became one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy. During her time as a bounty hunter, Granakk traveled the galaxy in a YT-1300 light freighter named Reckoning, which was heavily modified with increased durability, added shields, and improved weaponry. Shunned by other members of her species, she gained fame for the number of bounties that she had killed. Her reputation for killing and disfiguring her prisoners to the point that they could barely be recognized caused some individuals to commit suicide rather than face capture or death at the hands of Granakk, who was also known for relentlessly pursuing her targets.\nA female member of the Wookiee species, Granakk hailed from her species' home planet of Kashyyyk. At some point, she committed an act that caused her people to exile her, at which time she left the planet and entered the greater galaxy. The circumstances of her banishment were the subject of many rumors, including ones in which she was said to have killed her children to get revenge on her mate or to have become a madclaw by using her claws to attack and kill her mate in jealousy. Another rumor said that she was a traitor to her honor family, which would have included her closest friends, and allowed them to die in order to obtain wealth.\nAt some point following her exile, Granakk became a bounty hunter and eventually gained a reputation as one of the most feared in the galaxy. While working as a bounty hunter, she flew a heavily modified YT-1300 light freighter named Reckoning. In at least one instance, Granakk was captured while pursuing a bounty, but she was still able to claim it after escaping. Due to her exile from Kashyyyk, Granakk was hated and avoided by other Wookiees, who viewed her as a blemish upon the reputation of their species.\nStanding 2.25 meters tall, well above the two-meter average height of a female Wookiee, Granakk had yellow eyes; dark skin, which was visible around her eyes and on her nose; and brown fur that was matted and dirty a great deal of the time. Despite her loud, piercing battle cry, Granakk spoke as little as possible. In general, she only spoke in detail to her employers, the only entities to whom she was loyal. Granakk usually treated her dealings and conversations with her employers as confidential. When hunting an individual, Granakk preferred to fight intelligently and wait patiently in an ambush to attack her target. If an individual tricked her or was able to survive her initial assault, Granakk would enter a rage and attempt to overwhelm her opponent with brute strength in hand-to-hand combat and tear the individual's limbs from their sockets.\nAn extremely durable individual, Granakk stopped at nothing to capture or kill her bounty, whether by ambush or by brute force. During at least one occasion, she escaped capture merely to continue hunting her target. Some individuals even went so far as to say that Granakk had a death wish, but she did not confirm or deny that belief. She frequently brought back dead targets who were disfigured to the point of being barely recognizable—even those she originally captured alive. Due to her reputation for persistence and her tendency to kill and mutilate her quarry, Granakk instilled fear in many of her targets and caused some bounties to commit suicide upon seeing Granakk approach or hearing that she was pursuing them in order to avoid death or capture at her hands.\nGranakk was an extremely skilled pilot and was trained in plotting coordinates for jumps to hyperspace, especially for small transports and freighters, with which she was an excellent pilot in combat. Granakk was trained in the use of simple melee weapons; primitive weapons, such as bows and spears; blaster pistols; and blaster rifles. In regards to her profession, she was quite skilled at finding out information, was quite perceptive, and had some skill in tracking and ambushing individuals. Granakk had some knowledge about other species and had slight skill at repairing and disabling mechanical devices. She was also somewhat knowledgeable about surviving in the wilderness. She was literate in Galactic Basic Standard, Rodese, and her native language of Shyriiwook, which she also spoke fluently. However, like most Wookiees, she was unable to speak most languages other than Shyriiwook—she merely understood Rodese and Basic.\nDuring her time as a bounty hunter, Granakk carried a blaster rifle specially crafted to cause a greater amount of damage to its target and a light mace that was customized for her use. She wore a utility belt and a shoulder harness for carrying her weapons and ammunition. She also carried an improved security kit and a tool kit. For her personal starship, Granakk piloted a YT-1300 freighter named Reckoning, which was upgraded with heavy deflector shields, increased hull strength, and a powerful assault laser cannon, which replaced the stock freighter's laser cannon.\nGranakk was first featured in Ultimate Adversaries, a 2004 sourcebook written by Eric Cagle, Michelle Lyons, Michael Mikaelian, Steve Miller, Owen K.C. Stephens, and Wil Upchurch for the revised edition of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game. Granakk received an entry in the first chapter of the book, which presented various antagonists for gamemasters to use. Granakk was appropriate for high-leveled characters and was designed so that she could be used by gamemasters in any era they wanted. The book suggested that she could be employed by the Hutt Empire or a crime lord during the Rise of the Empire era or the New Jedi Order era, or that she could work for the Galactic Empire during the Rebellion era. The book also left the reason for her exile from Kashyyyk up to the decision of the gamemaster. An image of Granakk was created by Mikael Noguchi and was used for the character's entry in the book.",
