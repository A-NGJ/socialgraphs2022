 "content": "Kalya Zal was a Human female from the planet Zakuul who lived during the final decades of the Eternal Empire. The daughter of two Knights of Zakuul, Kalya was Force-sensitive like her mother and father, and she joined the prophetic Scions of Zakuul. When her parents died during the Battle of Scyva decades before 3630 BBY, Kalya was left to raise her six-year-old brother Indo herself.\nAlthough Indo was not a Force-user himself, Kalya taught him how to influence people, fit in with the Zakuulan elite, and rise in the social structure of the Eternal Empire, leading him to become a famous entertainer and fixer. However, in 3636 BBY, Emperor Arcann ordered his sister, High Justice Vaylin, to execute the Scions, and Kalya Zal was among the casualties. Indo was devastated by her death and, in an effort to avenge Kalya, worked his way into Vaylin's service so that he could get close to her and eventually bring her down.\nKalya Zal was mentioned in the Codex entry for Indo Zal in Knights of the Eternal Throne, the 2016 Digital Expansion to the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
