 "content": "Nintuk was a female Talz who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She was of average height for a Talz, standing at 2.1 meters, and slightly above average weight, at 91 kilograms. During Emperor Palpatine's reign, Nintuk was charged by the Empire with being responsible for the murder of Imperial personnel. A bounty of 75,000 credits was then issued by proclamation of the Emperor for either her capture, or proof of her death, though the bounty was restricted to bounty hunters holding an Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate, an Imperial-issued licence to allow an individual to legally hunt bounties. Nintuk's wanted poster was used in the Imperial edition of the Bounty Hunters Guild Handbook and pictured her wearing a necklace.\nNintuk was first described and pictured as the subject of a wanted poster in The Bounty Hunter Code: From the Files of Boba Fett, which was released in 2013 and written by Daniel Wallace, Ryder Windham and Jason Fry.",
