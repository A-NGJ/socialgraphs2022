 "content": "Katiara Orion was a Human female who died by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, she revealed herself as a Force ghost to a heroic spacer who salvaged the rivalry between her father Garrick Orion, and his longtime friend of Jonas Nova.\nA Human female by the name of Katiara Orion was the daughter of Garrick Orion, an occupant of Nova Orion Station who served as one of the founders of Nova Orion Industries, along with his old friend Jonas Nova. By the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Katiara died. Following her death, a mutual feeling of distrust and suspicion festered between the two founders of Nova Orion Industries, soon sparking the Nova Orion Crisis. However, it turned out that a Dark Jedi by the name of Ter-Doac Vaine was responsible for polluting the minds of these two businessmen, with the hope of seizing control of Nova Orion Station for himself. A heroic spacer foiled this plot and killed the diabolical Dark Jedi, thus restoring peace between Katiara's father and his longtime friend. Garrick then asked of the spacer to deliver a gravestone to the final resting place of Katiara Orion, located on the upper floor of the space station near her favorite flowers. After doing so, Katiara revealed herself to the spacer as a glowing blue Force ghost, thanking the individual for helping to reconcile the relationship between her father and his friend. She then bestowed to the spacer her favorite toy of a stuffed Star Destroyer. The spacer returned this toy to Katiara's father, providing a source of comfort for his grief.\nKatiara Orion was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
