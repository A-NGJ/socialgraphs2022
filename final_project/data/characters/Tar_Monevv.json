 "content": "Tar Monevv was a Yuuzhan Vong male born aboard a Koros-Strohna Worldship, and a member of the warrior caste. Holding the rank of commander, Monevv was an advance agent sent to destabilize enemy governments in advance for the Yuuzhan Vong to better conquer. Monevv hoped to one day escalate to the Yuuzhan Vong rank of warmaster, and his career gave evidence that this goal was not unreasonable.\nTar Monevv was born in the warrior caste of the Yuuzhan Vong, a sentient species native to an extra-galactic galaxy which had been devastated by a conflict between two droid species. Like all the other warriors, Monevv was trained from birth to excel in combat and show exceptional ferocity. A skilled fighter, he was eventually made a commander, making him a high-ranking officer in the Yuuzhan Vong army.\nWhen his people decided to conquer another galaxy to made it their new home, Monevv served as an agent provocateur whose role was to undermine the government of planet marked for conquest through acts of sabotage and espionage. He would regularly report to his Supreme Commander on a targeted world's population, government and military readiness.",
