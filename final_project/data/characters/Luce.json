 "content": "Luce was a female Dathomirian who was a Nightsister of Mother Talzin's clan. She fought in the Battle of Dathomir with two blasters until she was killed by the Separatist Droid Army.\nLuce was a member of Mother Talzin's clan of Nightsisters, who resided on the planet Dathomir. She was an accomplished warrior.\nWhen the Separatist leader Count Dooku ordered the extermination of the Nightsisters, General Grievous and the Separatist Droid Army were sent to wipe out the clan. As several Separatist landing craft deployed their droid forces, Luce and the Nightsisters prepared to fight back, led by Dooku's former apprentice, Asajj Ventress. During the battle, Luce fought with an energy bow before claiming two blasters from BX-series droid commandos. The Nightsisters numbers were reinforced by the undead Nightsisters resurrected by the magick of Old Daka.\nThe droids fought back by launching the Defoliator Deployment Tank to burn the witches out, forcing Luce and others to flee from the cover of the trees. Luce, aided by other Nightsisters, commandeered multiple Armored Assault Tanks. As the undead cut Ventress a path right to Grievous, Luce and the rest of the clan engaged in a ferocious firefight with the droids. Seeing Ventress injured, Luce rushed in to help her while the undead swarmed Grievous. However, as Luce was helping Ventress limp away from the battle, she was shot in the back by a B1-series battle droid, which Ventress swiftly destroyed with the Force. Ventress held her dying comrade in her arms, Luce told her to run in order to save herself before dying. The battle was lost not long after, with Ventress and Talzin being the only survivors of the massacre.",
