 "content": "Imono Durshana was a Force-sensitive Human male who lived on the planet of Rhinnal.\nDurshana was an employee of the Rhinnal State Medical Academy. He initially volunteered at the planet's Jedi chapter house because he possessed idealist aims, but he eventually grew paranoid. Because of this he often treated individuals who disagreed with him in a hostile manner.\nDurshana appeared to harbor delusions of being a Jedi Knight. During his spare time, he had taken to dressing in Jedi apparel and carrying a replica lightsaber around with him. In one particular incident, he sought to kill a group of off-worlders who were quarantined at the State Medical Academy because he believed them to be cursed. It is unclear if he was successful in this endeavor.",
