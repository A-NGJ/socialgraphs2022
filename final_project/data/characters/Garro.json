 "content": "Garro was a human male who taught Jedi Master Yoda, while they were inside a mountain which they discovered to be alive, in the ways of the stonepower, an aspect of the Force that was only attainable by being in proximity to blue stone, a type of stone imbued with the Living Force.\nAfter training Yoda, Garro and the Master went out from the mountain, but Garro betrayed Yoda and joined the Rockhawkers.\nSometime before 32 BBY, the human male Garro was born on a planet in the Vagadarr system and later exiled from his people, who called themselves Rockhawkers, because he was considered weak since he did not kill in battle. Garro was sent inside the Great mountain that stood near the village where he lived.\nSometime between 44 BBY and 32 BBY, Garro was found, almost starving, in a cave inside the Great mountain by the Jedi Grand Master Yoda. The Jedi helped him find some moss that Garro could eat, and the boy, to repay him, taught the Grand Master the ways of the stonepower, a way of the Force that used a stone imbued with the Living Force called blue stone. While Yoda was training, the Jedi felt that the mountain was alive in the Force.\nGarro helped Yoda wake the mountain up, and once it was awake, they decided to go out from the cave. The Jedi and the boy climbed down but were intercepted by the Rockhawkers. The sons asked them if they had found the heart of the mountain. While Yoda didn't want to tell them, Garro betrayed his student and explained everything to the Rockhawkers, and he eventually joined them.\nYoda went back to Mucktown to prepare the Mud dwellers for war, while Garro, with the help of the Rockhawkers, took the control of the living mountain.\nGarro first appeared in the comic Star Wars  28, written by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Salvador Larroca and Edgar Delgado.",
