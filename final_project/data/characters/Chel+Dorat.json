 "content": "Chel Dorat was an naval Admiral resident on Jerrilek and the father of Preela Dorat. Considered something of a strategic genius, Dorat served in both the Republic Navy and the Imperial Navy before becoming disillusioned with the Galactic Empire, ultimately defecting to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He went on to serve in the defense fleet of the New Republic.\nDorat served as a captain in the Republic Navy in the final years of the Galactic Republic. Appalled by the inefficiency and corruption of the Galactic Senate, he became a stout supporter of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and his plans to create a more efficient galactic government. With the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Dorat was admitted into the Imperial General Staff and achieved the rank of admiral.\nDorat eventually became appalled with the tyranny and oppressive methods of the Empire, which he openly opposed. However, whenever he attempted to protest, he was threatened back into silence. As a result, he retired to write his memoirs and work on a way to reform the Empire. This eventually led him to defect from the Empire and join the Rebel Alliance. When his daughter Preela learned about this, she contacted the Imperial Security Bureau and informed them about his plans. The ISB managed to capture him, but he was eventually rescued by Rebel operatives and taken to a secret Rebel base.\nChel Dorat later became Admiral in the New Republic Navy. He succeeded Voon Massa as the commander of the New Republic Fourth Fleet when Massa died at the Battle of Denon in 6 ABY, and successfully penetrated the Colonies with his fleet.",
