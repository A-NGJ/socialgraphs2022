 "content": "Mich Flenn was a Human male who worked as an old bar owner on Nar Shaddaa. In his younger days, he was a smuggler. When he earned enough money, he bought small bar in the Corellian Sectorâ€”the Blue Light.\nAs an old man, Flenn was considered experienced, but rather strange. He was a good bartender and a neverending source of somewhat incredible, but possibly true stories. For example, he spoke of intelligent beings with supernatural powers, which could be a reference to Jedi or Sith and sometimes told stories to Han Solo about Ood Bnar and the Iron Knights. He was often advised to contact entertainment media producers and tell them his stories, which could be the basis for outstanding holofilms.",
