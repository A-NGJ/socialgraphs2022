 "content": "The Tredway family was a family that lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic and through the Imperial Period. Axton Tredway, a Jedi Knight, broke the Jedi Code when he fell in love with his future wife and sired two children, Erling and Dena.\nBefore the end of the Clone Wars, Axton Tredway confided in his friend, Anakin Skywalker, and showed him his family and his home on 24 Tredway. When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine overthrew the Republic and nearly destroyed the Jedi Order, Tredway fled back to his family's home amidst the Sil'Lume asteroid belt. Using the knowledge which Tredway had shared with Skywalker—now a Sith Lord, Darth Vader—Imperials attacked 24 Tredway. Axton fled, hoping to draw away the Empire's ire. The Imperials, however, continued to harass the family, and Tredway returned. He fought off the Imperials, defeating them, but Vader himself soon arrived. The two former friends dueled, and Tredway was killed by Vader.",
