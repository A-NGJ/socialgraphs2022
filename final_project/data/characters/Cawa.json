 "content": "Cawa was a Quarren research scientist who was an expert in water purificiation. The scientist was assigned to Leia Organa Solo's Senate Select Committee for Refugees staff on Duro in 26 ABY. Along with Sidris Kolb, Cawa was responsible for the surface water of the planet, an endeavor that encountered many setbacks and was made more complicated by Sidris Kolb's cloud seeding efforts. During a meeting of the SELCORE research staff, the two engaged in an argument about their competing projects. Due to limited resources and projects that seemed to threaten each other, Cawa and the other researchers struggled to cooperate and such arguments were common.\nCawa first appeared in the 2000 novel The New Jedi Order: Balance Point, written by Kathy Tyers.",
