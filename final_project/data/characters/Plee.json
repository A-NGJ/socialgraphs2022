 "content": "Plee was a male Ho'Din plant development specialist whom the New Republic Senate Select Committee for Refugees assigned to a team working on terraforming the surface of Duro in 26 ABY. The planet was chosen to be a refuge for the millions of refugees fleeing the advance of the Yuuzhan Vong—an extra-galactic species intent on conquering the galaxy—and Plee worked on developing plants suitable for reviving the planet. Disputes over priorities and a lack of resources made their task difficult. Plee and the team's mission was ultimately unfilled, as the Yuuzhan Vong captured the planet.\nPlee was a male Ho'Din, a reptilian sentient species native to Moltok, located in the Atrivis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Trained as a plant development specialist, the pale-green Ho'Din gained a doctorate in his field of expertise.\nIn 25 ABY, the Yuuzhan Vong, a tattooed and an aggressive species from another galaxy, invaded the New Republic. With numerous early successes, they caused a massive flow of refugees to other worlds of the Republic. To deal with this problem, the Republic formed the Senate Select Committee for Refugees, commonly referred to as SELCORE. By 26 ABY, Plee was one of a number of research scientists working for SELCORE, assigned to work on terraforming the planet Duro, under the management of former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo. The Select Committee, under pressure to a find refuge for the multitude of refugees fleeing the Yuuzhan Vong advance, had selected Duro, a long polluted world, as a resettlement location; however, with Duro's atmosphere polluted by dangerous gases, the refugees were forced to live under a series of SELCORE habitation domes. Plee, along with the Talz Aj Koenes and a number of other specialists, was tasked with restoring the planet to a habitable state.\nPlee developed a number of vegetative species for the planet, at one point petitioning for use of Sector Four of some reclaimed marshlands in which to apply his work. However, the scientists struggled to form a unified plan, competing amongst themselves for scarce resources and the priority of their own projects; indeed, another scientist tried to claim Sector Four to use for grain projects. In addition to his own work, Dr. Plee was particularly concerned with restoring the atmosphere of Duro, so that the residents could move out from the protective domes. He was also dismissive of concerns over ecological over-breeding, considering it a minimal problem given the vast barren planet.\nWhile the scientists made significant progress on making the surface habitable, the efforts of Plee and the rest to create a refugee sanctuary were ultimately in vain, as the Yuuzhan Vong captured the planet later that year, scattering the Republic citizens gathered there. The Yuuzhan Vong later worked on terraforming Duro, eventually restoring it to its lush natural state.\nPlee was a scientist, gaining a doctorate in his field of plant development. Although he disputed it, Plee found living under the environmental domes claustrophobic. He wore a lab coat, even to meetings. Plee had green skin.\nPlee was created by Kathy Tyers for The New Jedi Order: Balance Point , the sixth novel in The New Jedi Order series. He was later given a short one-line entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia .",
