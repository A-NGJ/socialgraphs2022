 "content": "Clea Sook was a Human female mercenary who was active during the Galactic Civil War. She was a hard-edged woman and was distinguished by the black tattoos covering her face and hands.\nIn 0 ABY, Sook was hired by the assassin X-7 to track down Luke Skywalker and kill him for X-7's master. When she arrived to meet X-7, he attacked her and the other bounty hunters to test if they were worthy to work for him. She survived and was told she had to work in a team led by Lune Divinian. They tracked Skywalker heading to Kamino and attacked his team, but was surprised when everyone, including her, crashed on to the surface of the planet. She survived and tried to attack Divinian,but he disarmed her and let her walk away.\nLater, when she was still trapped on the planet, Clea recaptured her blaster and tried to kill Divinian, but a monster came up behind her and ate her.",
