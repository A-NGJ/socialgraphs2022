 "content": "Baftu was the leader of the Syndicat on Phindar. He was in league with Prince Beju, who had stripped his people of bacta, and was going to get some from Phindar to look like a hero to the people of Gala.\nBaftu initiated his droids to kill his assistant, Terra Derida, after accusing her of stealing the Syndicat's treasury. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised himself as Prince Beju in order to expose the Syndicat's plans to the people of Phindar. When the people of Phindar got the chance to attack the Syndicat for their bacta back, Guerra Derida had Baftu jailed.",
