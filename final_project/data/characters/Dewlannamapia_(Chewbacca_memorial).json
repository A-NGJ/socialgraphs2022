 "content": "Dewlannamapia was a Wookiee who attended the dedication of a memorial portrait to the late Chewbacca at the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nA Dewlannamapia appears in James Luceno's The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force, the final novel of The New Jedi Order series, attending the memorial to the late Chewbacca. Dewlannamapia was the name of the Wookiee who raised Han Solo as established in The Paradise Snare. However, as the novel is set thirty-nine years after Dewlannamapia's death, the Wookiee in The Unifying Force must be another individual.",
