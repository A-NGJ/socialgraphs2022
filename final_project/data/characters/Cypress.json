 "content": "Cypress was a male human who served as a general in the ground forces of the Resistance, a paramilitary group founded by Leia Organa to monitor and oppose the actions of the First Order. Thirty years after the Battle of Endor, the First Order used Starkiller Base, an ice planet turned into a megaweapon, to destroy the entire Hosnian system, dealing a major blow to the New Republic by eliminating its current government. In response, the Resistance set off to destroy the megaweapon. During the ensuing assault on Starkiller Base, Cypress was among the officers who monitored the starfighters from the Resistance base on D'Qar.\nIn Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, General Cypress was played by Gerry Abrams, the father of the movie's director J.J. Abrams. He can be seen to the left of the screen when C-3PO declares the Resistance pilots \"need a miracle.\" Although Cypress was identified as a captain in the movie credits, the rank badge he wears is that of an army general. Abrams later reprised this role for Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.",
