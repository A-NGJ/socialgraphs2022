 "content": "Palpatine's second brother was one of at least three male children of Naboo aristocrat and head of House Palpatine Cosinga Palpatine and his wife. His eldest brother, known simply as Palpatine, became a Dark Lord of the Sith as Darth Sidious, Senator of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and Emperor of the galaxy.\nPalpatine's relationship with his second brother was one of mutual contempt, as was his relationship with all his siblingsâ€”they considered Palpatine an interloper and resented him, and he, in turn, considered them \"well-behaved\" and held them in contempt for not sharing his vast ambition. The younger brothers and the sisters were, however, their father's pride, representing all that Palpatine could never be.\nIn 65 BBY, Palpatine's second brother was present along with his family and bodyguards when they took Palpatine from Chandrila in the family yacht. After the starship left Chandrila, Palpatine slaughtered everyone inside, including his young brothers.\nPalpatine remembered the lifeless forms of his siblings slumped on the starship floor every time his Sith master, Darth Plagueis, urged him to recall the murders in vivid detail as part of his training in the dark side.",
