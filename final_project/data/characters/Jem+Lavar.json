 "content": "Jem Lavar was a male Sullustan male slicer who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Jem Lavar lived on the planet Tatooine. He worked as a freelance slicer for some criminals as well as for both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. In 1 ABY, Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra were involved in the search of an important cargo smuggled to Tatooine from Tansarii Point Station. Rebel and Imperial agents acquired the inventory of the shipment and needed a slicer to get the data. The spacers then went to Jem Lavar and rescued him from a group of gunrunners. Lavar finally decrypted the data and discovered that both Barrezz and Bastra were actually looking for a droid that was sold to the junk dealer Watto.\nJem Lavar was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jem Lavar was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nIn the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game expansion Agents of Deception, this character was erroneously identified as Jam Lavar on the card titled Who Has the Button?.",
