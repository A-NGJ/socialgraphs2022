 "content": "Alvon Zamar was a Human male Moff who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nDuring the battle on Corellia in 3640 BBY, Alvon Zamar was ordered to survey the occupation by the Dark Council. He was aided by Cipher Nine who planted several landing beacons across Labor Valley in order to force Zamar's skyhopper to land, allowing the agent to rescue the Moff from the Republic Special Forces Division who were attacking his downed ship. However, he was killed by Cipher Nine during the battle.",
