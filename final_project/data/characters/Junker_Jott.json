 "content": "Junker Jott was an engineer leading a major crew on Mek-Sha in 3627 BBY.\nJunker Jott worked for the Republic Navy for 30 years, before retiring from the service as a veteran. Many of Junker Jott's friends were killed by Imperials, leaving him with a deep dislike for the Empire, even after retiring from the Navy.\nAfter moving to Mek-Sha, Junker Jott helped overthrow the incumbent Hutt rulers by programming the multitude of word droids to rebel against the Hutts. After expelling the Hutts, his crew became one of the leading factions on Mek-Sha, responsible for keeping the station from collapsing with his team of engineers and droids. Junker Jott oversaw the assault on The Brothers slavers' headquarters in the Brothers Oversight Center, assisting a Republic agent to free several slaves and eliminate a slaver lieutenant and the Sith Empire contact during a trade deal.\nJunker Jott liked to constantly remind fellow residents on Mek-Sha that without him, the station would fall apart at least ten times a day.",
