 "content": "The Fixer was a human male criminal who operated during the First Order-Resistance War. A smooth-talking schemer and intellectual, the Fixer used his charms to convince others to assist him in his illicit enterprises. At one point, he conducted his business aboard the Halcyon, an MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser operated by Chandrila Star Line.\nThe Fixer is planned to appear in Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, an interactive hotel experience set to open at the Walt Disney World Resort in 2022. In audition sides posted for the character by The Walt Disney Company, The Fixer attempts to make a deal with guests aboard the Halcyon, offering to give them access to the ship's manifest if they pass a test of his creation. Additionally, the company's audition form encouraged actors with sleight of hand skills to read for the role.",
