 "content": "Halle was a Human female from Acherin who was married to Alder.\nDuring the Clone Wars, when Acherin joined sides with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Halle, along with her husband and many civilians refused to support the Separatists and fought for the Galactic Republic. However, when the war ended in 19 BBY, the Republic was reorganized into the first Galactic Empire under the rule of Emperor Palpatine. Halla and the people of Acherin fought against the Empire which led to a civil war.\nIn 18 BBY, Halle and her husband were visited by Clive Flax when he arrived on the planet after the Clone Wars, looking for information on the rebel known as Flame. Saying at first that he was looking for Alder's sister, Vira, who had died in the fighting that engulfed the planet's population, he gained their trust. Halle told Clive what she knew about Flame, whom she believed had grown up in the city of Sood.",
