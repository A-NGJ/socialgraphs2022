 "content": "Snaplaunce was a male Ithorian and a member of the Hweg Shul Municipal Police. He and his partner Grupp saved Luke Skywalker from near death at the hands of Taselda's followers.\nBy 44 ABY when Luke and his son, Ben, along with Vestara Khai visited Nam Chorios in pursuit of Abeloth, Snaplaunce was the mayor of Hweg Shul. He acquired the position with the help of his TIE/sh VIP shuttle, Vote Snaplaunce. He loaned the group his shuttle to aid them in finding the fugitive, Dr. Wei. Afterwards, he was stabbed in the back with a vibroblade, which was blamed on the Skywalkers. He later recovered and stated that it was not the Skywalkers who assaulted him.",
