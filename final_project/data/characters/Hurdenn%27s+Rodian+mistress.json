Lieutenant Pierce, working under Hurdenn's command, learned about the affair and blackmailed Hurden into transferring him to serve under the Emperor's Wrath, far away from Taris.\nHurdenn's Rodian mistress is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic during a Sith Warrior-class-exclusive companion mission of Lieutenant Pierce.",
