 "content": "Tera was a female Human who worked as a mercenary with the Weequay Kasso Trelek and the droid N1-FEX. On one occasion the group traveled to a cantina within the territory of the crime lord Grogen. Once seated, Tera and her companions were served Lum ale. The criminal Vols approached Tera and threatened her. Tera called the droid, after which he produced a light repeating blaster from his heavy carrying case and open fire, destroying much of the bar and killing a number of the thugs with Vols. After Kasso threw a thermal detonator into the fight from the refresher, the thugs and other patrons of the cantina fled, followed shortly after by Tera and her companions once they realized the detonator was not a decoy. The explosion destroyed the cantina, flinging a durasteel spike through one of Fex's legs. The trio then fled for the nearest spaceport.\nTera appears in the opening story in Fantasy Flight Games' roleplaying game sourcebook Dangerous Covenants.",
