 "content": "Coruum Sa'dia was an Ishi Tib male businessman who owned and operated the shipping concern Zelcomm Industries during the early years of the Galactic Empire. The company was in truth a front for an illegal smuggling operation and Sa'dia directed his illicit business personally from within Zelcomm Tower, the headquarters of Zelcomm Industries, which was situated in Sector 1265 of the planet Coruscant. After the Kadas'sa'Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos, a customer of Zelcomm Industries, went on the run from the Pyke Syndicate, Sa'dia encountered a group of Pyke-affiliated agents who ventured Zelcomm Tower in search of information on Leeachos' activities.",
