 "content": "Erich S. Datoo was a human male military officer who held the rank of colonel in the First Order. In 34 ABY, Datoo was in charge of the primary fire control room on the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. Under orders from Supreme Leader Snoke, he oversaw the weapon as it destroyed the Hosnian system, the location of the New Republic Galactic Senate. The weapon then began preparing to fire on the Ileenium system, where the Resistance headquarters was located; however, Resistance forces then attacked the superweapon. As it became clear the base was going to be destroyed, Datoo was shocked to see Lieutenant Rodinon trying to leave the control room, and questioned where he was going, although the latter talked back and bluntly pointed out that they needed to evacuate or else they won't survive, citing that even the base's commander, Hux, had already evacuated. Starkiller Base then exploded, killing Datoo along with it.\nDatoo was a methodical officer who believed that the destructive power of Starkiller Base should command respect from all members of the First Order. He wore a teal First Order Army uniform with a crested command cap and a band on the left arm written in Aurebesh that commemorated the Imperial Warlord Kaplan.\nErich S. Datoo was portrayed by Rocky Marshall in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The character was not identified in the film, but was named in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film. The character is also identified by name in the subtitles on the film's home video release.",
