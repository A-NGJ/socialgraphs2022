 "content": "Naia Sendar was a female Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Republic Classic era.\nNaia Sendar was a Force-sensitive Human who received training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. After constructing a yellow-bladed lightsaber for herself, she eventually went on to attain the rank of Jedi Knight. Continuing her studies independently, she strove to become a Guardian, one of the Order's three fields of study for Knights. Becoming recognized as a Guardian, Jedi Sendar had the look of a young, innocent girl; though a lightsaber scar across her cheek revealed her true nature as a warrior. Sometime during her knighthood, for reasons unknown, Jedi Sendar felt betrayed by the Jedi High Council on Coruscant, leaving her supercilious.\nNaia Sendar was originally intended to be included in Ultimate Adversaries but was cut, presumably for space restraints. All information on her comes from the brief sent to Chris Trevas, who made her illustration.",
