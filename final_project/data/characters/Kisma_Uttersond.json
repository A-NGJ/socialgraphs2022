 "content": "Kisma Uttersond was a Chadra-Fan male doctor. At some point, Uttersond attended medical school though it left him in debt. Eventually Uttersond joined the Nihil pirate organization, and cared for Mari San Tekka, a hyperspace prospector who was kept aboard the flagship Gaze Electric, surviving in a medical capsule. Uttersond would be summoned when San Tekka, who was used by the Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro to discover Paths through hyperspace, entered into a seizure. Following the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Ro wished for San Tekka to find the locations of future Emergences of the event. Uttersond contacted Ro through his comlink, insisting that San Tekka be allowed to rest for at least a week. Ro dismissed the doctor, ending the transmission when he attempted to continue speaking.\nUttersond was sadistic and skilled in torture yet insisted that, as a doctor, he helped people. While able to build impressive torture devices, he never upgraded the prosthetic leg he walked upon.\nKisma Uttersond first appeared in the novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule and published on January 5, 2021. His forename was provided in the subsequent novel The High Republic: The Rising Storm, written by Cavan Scott and published on June 29. Uttersond was later pictured in \"Tales of Villainy: The Gaze Electric,\" a comic story written by Daniel Jos√© Older, illustrated by Nick Brokenshire, and published in Star Wars Adventures  6 on July 7, 2021.",
