 "content": "A Gamorrean male served on the Star Jewel, Jabba Desilijic Tiure's Minstrel-class space yacht, during 1 ABY. When the Jewel's tractor beam captured the ship of Rebel agent Kyle Katarn, the Gamorrean and another escorted Katarn to the ship's beast pit, which held Jabba's favorite Kell dragon. After an ill-fated discussion between Jabba the Hutt and Katarn over a hologram, in which Jabba expressed regret over not being able to witness the execution in person, the two Gamorreans pushed Katarn into the pit. The agent was stronger than they realized, however, when Katarn killed the dragon with his bare hands. Katarn eventually rescued his partner, Jan Ors, and together they escaped the Star Jewel in his recovered ship.\nThe Gamorrean first appeared in the 1994 video game Star Wars: Dark Forces, first appearing in one of the game's cutscenes. The Gamorrean can later be encountered during the level again, where the player can kill the Gamorrean.",
