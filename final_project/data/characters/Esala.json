 "content": "Esala was a Human female native to the Undercity of Taris.\nShe was the village healer. Lacking any serum, she was forced to keep the victims infected with the rakghoul disease in a pen until they had mutated and destroyed each other. She was very impressed when Revan managed to procure some serum from a dead Sith trooper and cure two of the victims before their mutation, allowing them to return to society.\nShe, like all the Outcasts, left the village for the Promised Land.",
