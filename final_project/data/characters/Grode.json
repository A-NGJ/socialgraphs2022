 "content": "Grode was an Imperial TIE/LN starfighter pilot, who held the ranks of Major and Wing Commander on the planet Cilpar in 4 ABY.\nMajor Grode commanded Crimson Squadron in defense of Moff Boren Tascl's base at Kiidan. He accepted Rogue Squadron's Tycho Celchu — in disguise as an Imperial officer at the time — into his squadron as it was scrambled to intercept the local resistance movement headed by Elscol Loro. He was shot down by Tycho's X-wing, which was being piloted by Winter at the time.\nUnlike other TIE pilots, he didn't wear a fully enclosed helmet and his armor's appearance is different as well. This is due to the fact that he modified his TIE interceptor by adding life support systems. Apart from the life support systems, his interceptor also featured longer wingtip laser cannon barrels which might be due to the fact that he upgraded them. The chin laser cannon hard points are missing.",
