 "content": "Idryssa Barruck was a human female soldier who worked in the fight against the Galactic Empire. When Saw Gerrera took in the eight year-old girl Jyn Erso, Idryssa brought her suitable clothes and taught her about health and hygiene, including menstrual health. She first worked for Gerrera's Partisans, but over the next few years, Idryssa became distanced from Saw's group before leaving it entirely, breaking off and joining a more unified group. Later, fellow Partisan Xosad Hozem joined with Idryssa's new group.\nIdryssa frequently disagreed with Saw's extremist tactics, insisting that they had to be better than the enemy. She did, however, provide him with information and ideas for new missions.\nIdryssa had very dark skin, and used colored makeup to give it a sparkling effect.\nIdryssa was known to carry a pair of machetes strapped to her back.",
