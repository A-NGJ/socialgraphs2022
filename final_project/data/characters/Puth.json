 "content": "Puth was a male Nimbanel, who lived around the time of the Second Galactic Civil War. Earning a living as an accountant, Puth worked for the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett. Fett often made use of Puth's financial knowledge when buying stock market shares, and relied on the Nimbanel accountant to manage his accumulated fortune, paying him a significant sum of credits to ensure confidentiality in his affairs. Puth was also capable of laundering money and erasing audit trails with great proficiency.",
