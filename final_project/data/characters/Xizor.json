 "content": "Xizor was a Falleen male prince-turned-crime-lord who ruled the Black Sun criminal syndicate. The prince was headquartered in the Southern Underground region of the Coruscant Underworld where he owned a 102-story-high palace. According to the Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs, Xizor was the namesake of Xizor Salad, though he was dubious of the rumor and believed it was likely only a legend. Xizor also shared his name with Xizor Transport Systems.\nXizor was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in the fifty-third issue of the 2014 magazine Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon. In the Stars Wars Legends continuity, Xizor was first mentioned in the 1995 novel Darksaber written by Kevin J. Anderson. He first appeared in the 1996 novel Shadows of the Empire by Steve Perry and went on to play a major role in the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia project.\nDuring the Boonta Eve Classic sequence of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the micro-machine toy figurine of Xizor was used as a stand-in for members of the crowd. However, as this cameo was solely used as background fill-ins, it is unknown if this would be considered an actual appearance of the character.",
