 "content": "Volryder was a male Human Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order and served as general during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, he was stationed on Alderaan where he was ordered by Jedi Master Nomen Karr to protect Jaesa Willsaam's mother and father from the Sith. When Darth Baras' Sith apprentice entered to meet with Jaesa's parents, Volryder stood in front to protect them and ordered his men to rally around him. However, Gregor wanted to know why he and his wife were targets and would ask the apprentice about Jaesa. When the apprentice only wanted them to give Jaesa a message, the parents were Force choked to death in front of Volryder's eyes. Volryder engaged the Sith Warrior in a lightsaber duel, but he was killed.\nThe Sith Warrior has three options: he/she would convince the parents to join the Empire and spare them, and letting Volryder leave. If the Sith Warrior faces Volryder, he/she would force him to give into his anger or instead just face him in the duel both ways.",
