 "content": "\"Trap\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served as a Clone Lieutenant in Tango Company during the Clone Wars.\nThe Clone Lieutenant known as \"Trap\" served with Tango Company during the Clone Wars. Following the Second Battle of Geonosis, Trap's company was assigned to escort the Pelta-class frigate TB-73 under the command of Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee to an Ord Cestus medical station. However, clone trooper CT-9544 \"Scythe\" was infected with a Geonosian brain worm and secretly brought a batch of eggs aboard the starship.\nTrap and \"Havoc\" entered the cafeteria aboard the frigate, where Tano and Offee had just finished fighting off two infected clone. Trap attempted to diffuse the situation when the Jedi took a defensive stance, feigning ignorance about his soldiers' actions. He then accompanied the Padawans as they attempted to regain control of the ship.\nOnce the group had reached their destination, the doors shut. While they were distracted with the doors, Trap took this opportunity to attack them, revealing he was infected when the brain worm emerged from his mouth and attempted to infect Offee. During the struggle, Offee used her lightsaber to kill Trap, preventing the lieutenant from infecting her with the parasite.\nTrap wore Phase I clone trooper armor with blue markings that were consistent with his unit. He utilized a DC-15A blaster carbine.",
