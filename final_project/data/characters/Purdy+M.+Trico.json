 "content": "Purdy M. Trico was a Human male who served as the captain of an Imperial Star Destroyer that would later be renamed the Crynyd during the Galactic Civil War. He was an extremely muscular man, being a fourth-generation settler of a high-gravity world. Trico, a follower of a polytheistic religion  who always wore a religious amulet underneath his uniform, was notoriously harsh and did not hesitate to shoot his subordinates if they had failed him.\nHe was killed in the battle in the Milagro system, after killing his own executive officer until he was shot in the head by his own weapons control officer.\nIn the audio adaptation of Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, he was voiced by John Wehrmann.",
