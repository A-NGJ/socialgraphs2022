 "content": "Grk'kkrs'ar was the name of a mythic Tusken Raider who, according to Sand People legend, never showed fear, even when facing a krayt dragon.\nIn 1 ABY travelers on the world of Tatooine were terrorized by a group that called themselves the Clan of Grk'kkrs'ar. However, it was speculated that this clan was not made up of the desert planet's fierce natives, but was instead made up of local criminals.\nGrk'kkrs'ar is mentioned in the description for a mission called \"The Clan of Grk'kkrs'ar\", that was available to players of Star Wars Galaxies at mission terminals on Tatooine.",
