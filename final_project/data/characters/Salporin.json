 "content": "Salporin was a Wookiee warrior in the Kachirho Wookiee Militia in the Wookiee Army of the Galactic Republic. He fought in the Battle of Kashyyyk, one of the final engagements of the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The battle ended with the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic having turned on the Jedi due to the activation of Order 66 by Darth Sidious. In the aftermath of the battle, the newly formed Galactic Empire took the majority of the Wookiee population as slaves. Salporin wore armor upon the head and on the shoulders.\nSalporin first appeared in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005. Portrayed by David Stiff in a Wookiee suit, his movements were used as a model for several digitally created Wookiees featured in the movie. Salporin non-canonically appears as a CPU during multiplayer AI matches in Star Wars Battlefront II as a Wookiee reinforcement for the Galactic Republic and Rebel Alliance.\nSalporin was originally created by author Timothy Zahn for his 1991 Star Wars Legends novel Heir to the Empire. Later, the official StarWars.com original Databank retconned Salporin to be one of the Wookiees seen fighting in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The character was first canonically named as Salporin in 2016 by the mobile app Star Wars: Card Trader.\nStar Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide establishes that the majority of the Wookiee population was enslaved after the Battle of Kashyyyk. Canonically, Salporin has yet to be established as part of this population. However, the non-canon show, LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures expanded on Salporin's capture in the epsiode Peril on Kashyyyk where his name is mentioned on a prison directory.",
