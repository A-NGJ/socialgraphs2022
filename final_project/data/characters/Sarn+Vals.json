 "content": "Sarn Vals was a Quarren Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive, Sarn Vals was discovered by the Jedi Order as an infant and instructed in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Eventually completing training and passing the Trials of Knighthood, Vals was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Serving the Order throughout the Clone Wars, a violent and costly conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Vals was able to survive an attack by the Grand Army of the Republic in 19 BBY. The Grand Army, which the Order had fought alongside and commanded during the entire conflict, turned on their Jedi leaders when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Jedi and initiated Contingency Order 66 in a secret scheme to destroy the Order.\nFleeing into exile, Vals escaped to the Corporate Sector and went to ground. However, when a disturbance was reported in the sector, the Inquisitorius of the newly formed Galactic Empire traced it back to the fugitive Vals and sent agents to locate and destroy the Quarren Jedi outlaw.",
