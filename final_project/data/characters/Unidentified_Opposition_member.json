 "content": "A human female puppeteer became a member of the Opposition, a political performance troupe, during the Republic Era. While the Opposition was operating on the Inner Rim planet Pijal, the Pijali puppeteer participated in her troupe's staged performances. She and her colleagues protested the signing of the Governance Treaty, a motion they felt would have detrimental effects on the citizens of Pijal's moon. At some point, the puppeteer began initiating innocuous pranks promoting her stance on the treaty, such as setting a politically messaged balloon to go off near the Pijali palace.\nShortly after voicing its dissent, the Opposition was framed by the Pijali monarchy for several attacks on Czerka Corporation facilities that were committed by blackguards, a secret group of Pijali royal guards. As a result, the troupe was forced into hiding on Pijal's moon. Around 40 BBY, she helped Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, escape from a blackguard ambush on Pijal's moon during the pair's mission to investigate the Opposition. The puppeteer's leader, Halin Azucca, held a meeting with the Jedi in a nearby hideout, which she attended. She supported Azucca's claim to the Jedi that the Opposition had been framed, referencing their troupe's artistic former occupations as proof of their innocence.\nDuring the Republic Era, a human hailing from the moon of the Inner Rim planet Pijal trained as a puppeteer. At some point, she decided to join the Opposition, a political performance troupe of Pijali natives led by Halin Azucca. For some time, the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public.\nBy around 40 BBY, the Pijali Opposition member and her colleagues began to protest the signing of Governance Treaty due to its support of the Czerka Corporation, a company that had been exploiting Pijal and its moon for centuries. She helped initiate several pranks as part of a peaceful protest, including setting a politically messaged balloon to go off near the Pijali palace in Pijal's capital city. Shortly after, members of the Opposition, including the puppeteer, were framed by the Pijali monarchy for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities.\nDue to the framing, the troupe was forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where its members gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by blackguards, a secret division of royal guards loyal to Pijal's Princess Fanry. During their mission to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The Jedi's escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including the puppeteer. She helped escort the Jedi to a nearby hideout, where Azucca informed them of the Opposition's entirely peaceful intentions.\nThe troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. The puppeteer corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, referring to the innocuous former professions of her colleagues Reckly and Bajjo, and also reflecting on her own artistic puppeteer training. She and her colleagues were happy to learn from Kenobi that the balloon prank set at the palace had gone off two days before the Jedi's visit, which further convinced Jinn that the Opposition consisted of harmless pranksters. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which the puppeteer had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.\nAs a puppeteer, the Opposition member enjoyed the staged performances her troupe engaged in to express their political opinions. She felt that the Governance Treaty would detrimentally affect the citizens of Pijal's moon by underrepresenting them. However, she was unwilling to hurt others to protest the motion, and instead found relish in setting innocuous pranks, one of which used a balloon. Despite the danger that came from being framed, the puppeteer opted to stay with the Opposition instead of turning herself in to Pijal's government. By the time of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi's visit to Pijal's moon, the Opposition member possessed a more youthful appearance than her leader, Halin Azucca.\nThe puppeteer obtained a blaster while in hiding on Pijal's moon, which she used to defend herself from blackguard attacks.\nThe Opposition member appeared in Master \u0026 Apprentice, a 2019 novel by Claudia Gray.",
