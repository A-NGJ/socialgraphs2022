 "content": "Valen-Da was a powerful male Voss Mystic that lived during the Galactic War.\nAround 3640 BBY, Valen was greatly concerned with the dark entity Sel-Makor that lived at the center of the Dark Heart, and thought of a method to destroy him and purge the corruption from the Nightmare Lands. He had a Force vision in which Sith Lord, a Jedi Knight and a Voss Commando were decisive in the demise of Sel-Makor.\nWhen Valen-Da met Lord Fulminiss he recognized him as the Sith from his vision and agreed to work with him, but only to ensure that the vision come true. Together the Sith and the Mystic went to the Nightmare Lands, followed by the Hero of Tython and the Voss Commando Tala-Reh.\nIn the Dark Heart, the Hero defeated Fulminiss and Tala-Reh sacrificed herself to destroy Sel-Makor. Valen-Da promised that her sacrifice would not be forgotten and departed back to Voss-Ka.\nValen-Da is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.\nIn a dark side option, the player can sacrifice Valen-Da to Sel-Makor, saving Tala-Reh. You can also strike him down out of disgust after Tala-Reh is sacrificed.",
