 "content": "Tas Kee was a female Weequay from Sriluur. She moved to Coruscant and became an enforcer for the minor gangster Hat Lo. Kee was skilled in concealing weapons.\nTas Kee started working as one of the gangster Hat Lo's bodyguards. Lo used a group of bodyguards to protect him against the Hutts. Kee was strong in hiding weapons, even for sensors installed in Coruscant's lower regions. She was often employed in the vicinity of the Outlander Club and other gambling clubs to defend Lo's interests.\nUnlike most female Weequay, Kee did not shave her head hair.\nTas Kee is unlikely to be seen in the Outlander and was placed in the Outlander just like Hat Lo via a retcon. She was played by an uncredited extra.",
