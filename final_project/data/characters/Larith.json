 "content": "The Sith pureblood male Larith served the Sith Empire as a Sith Lord during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. During the war he was stationed on board the Vaiken Spacedock space station within the Imperial fleet, where he sold equipment to other Imperials in the supplies section of the station. Larith wore a black and white set of armor including a helmet and a cloak while working.\nLarith was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he serves as an Imperial classic gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
