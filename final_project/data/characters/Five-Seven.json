 "content": "Five-Seven was the callsign of a clone trooper pilot assigned to Traffic Interdiction Vessel TIV Z766/2, in which he was ordered to retrieve ARC Trooper Null-5 and clone commando RC-3222 from the Outer Rim planet Olanet in the year 21 BBY. He was involved in a brief but intense confrontation in the Hydian Way while in Neimoidian space a day later, which resulted in a Neimoidian transport's destruction. After the skirmish, Five-Seven and his passengers rendezvoused on the Core World planet Drall with Sergeant Kal Skirata.\nDuring the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic, Five-Seven piloted Traffic Interdiction Vessel TIV Z766/2 in 21 BBY while serving with the Grand Army of the Republic's Navy. 460 days after the First Battle of Geonosis, Five-Seven was assigned to exfiltrate ARC trooper Lieutenant Null-5 \"Prudii\" and clone commando RC-3222 \"Atin\" from the Outer Rim planet Olanet in his heavily-camouflaged TIV freighter. The two special forces operatives had been sabotaging the battle droid factory on Olanet, and were successfully retrieved by Five-Seven.\nA day later, Five-Seven was ordered by Prudii to enter Neimoidian space on the Hydian Way Super-hyperroute, which was concerning to Atin, but the Prudii and Five-Seven remained unworried even in intensely hostile territory. Affirming Atin's concerns, a Confederacy transport laden with an estimated thousand battle droids neared the jump point alongside the TIV. At Prudii's command, however, Five-Seven launched a spread of six proton torpedoes, which summarily destroyed the transport—and it's contents—as Five-Seven made the jump into hyperspace for safer territory.\nAfter the close call in the Hydian Way, Five-Seven piloted the TIV to the rendezvous point on the temperate Core World planet Drall, where Prudii and Atin debriefed with their mentor and adopted father, sergeant Kal Skirata, a day after the Hydian Way confrontation. Following a short exchange with Skirata, Atin returned to the TIV and Five-Seven, ready to return to the Core World planet of Coruscant, headquarters of Atin's home unit.\nAs a male Human clone of bounty hunter Jango Fett, Five-Seven stood 1.83 meters tall and was born on the Wild Space world of Kamino. Five-Seven enjoyed operating with the Null-class ARC troopers and was calm and professional at the helm of his TIV, even while performing precise combat actions.\nFive-Seven expertly piloted his Traffic Intervention Vessel in combat, and was able to, with the assistance of Prudii, destroy an enemy transport ship with enough precision to leap into hyperspace at the moment of the transport's destruction, saving the TIV from damage while simultaneously exiting hostile space.\nFive-Seven first appeared in the short story Odds by Karen Traviss, which was featured in Star Wars Insider 87 in April 2006. An illustration of Five-Seven by Robert Hendrickson was featured with the story, which strongly reflected the image of a clone trooper pilot that appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.",
