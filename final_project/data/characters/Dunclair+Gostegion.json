 "content": "Dunclair Gostegion was a Human male hailing from the Corporate Sector. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a corporate job, he joined swoop gangs as a teenager. Gostegion's father attempted to straighten him out by enrolling him in a strict boarding school; the young man stowed away on a freighter and left his homeworld behind. Drifting throughout the Corporate Sector and Centrality, Gostegion became known as both a gambler and a gunslinger, even travelling with Gallandro for a time.\nGostegion's travels take him to Cloud City, where he engaged in a game of high-stakes sabacc with two young card sharks and the Baron Administrator. During the game, Gostegion caught one of the young men cheating, and called him out. The cheater drew his gun and the gunslinger responded in kind, killing the young man. However, Gostegion found out that the dead card player was the son of one of Black Sun's Vigos. Unsure of how the Vigo would react to the death of his son, Gostegion fled to Tasariq to keep a low profile.",
