 "content": "Father Tiirtha was a male Tarasin who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, Mother Dariana, the unofficial leader of the Tarasin, invoked the Great Ritual in an attempt to protect the interests of her people. However, conditions on Cularin worsened for the Tarasin as a result of the war and several months after the performance of the Great Ritual, Tiirtha and the other leaders of the Tarasin gathered to oppose Dariana's course of action. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, Dariana announced that she would step down as leader as the end of the year, and she appointed Tiirtha as her successor.\nTiirtha was impetuous and ambitious, but he was also compassionate. Dariana believed that he would be a good leader, who give his all to serving the interests of the Tarasin.",
