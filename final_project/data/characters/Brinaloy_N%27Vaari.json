 "content": "Brinaloy N'Vaari was a Devaronian female from the the planet Abregado-rae during the Galactic Civil War. She was the granddaughter of the previous Provincial Governor and as such, grabbed the attention of the current Governor, A'jidre Skrigatov. Despite forwarding a guise of honor, Skrigatov was simply a petty criminal, and had assassinated N'Vaari's grandfather to take power. Five years later, to gain political support, Skrigatov arranged to be wed to N'Vaari.\nA local Rodian gangster named Malkoi shared a mutual vendetta with Skrigatov, though, and arranged for N'Vaari to be kidnapped. Malkoi hoped to blackmail Skrigatov out of power and install a puppet governor.\nThey were both foiled when N'Vaari used her comprehensive training as an actress to impersonate a Twi'lek performer at the Starlight Theater located on Phyrstal Island in the resort city of Le Yer.",
