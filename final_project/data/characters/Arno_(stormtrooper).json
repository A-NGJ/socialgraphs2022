 "content": "Arno was a Human male stormtrooper who was stationed aboard an All Terrain Armored Transport on the Forest Moon of Endor in 4 ABY. That year, during the early stages of the Battle of Endor, Arno was among the stormtroopers to whom Rebel Alliance Commander Luke Skywalker surrendered with the request to be brought before their commanding officer, Major Lesim. Arno and his companions delivered Skywalker to Lesim, and their captive requested them to bring him to the Dark Lord Darth Vader on the moon.\nThe Human male Arno served as a stormtrooper in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Under the command of Major Lesim, Arno was among the stormtroopers stationed aboard an All Terrain Armored Transport that was patrolling the Forest Moon of Endor in 4 ABY. That year, early during the Battle of Endor, Arno and four other stormtroopers were on guard duty outside their walker when they were approached by Rebel Commander Luke Skywalker, who intended to turn himself in by using a mind trick with the Force to persuade the troopers to bring him to their commanding officer. Taking Skywalker's lightsaber, the troopers brought him to the walker's transport section to present him to Lesim.\nWhen Arno and his companions showed Skywalker's lightsaber to Lesim, the major recognized Skywalker and believed that he would get a commendation for capturing the famous Rebel, so he ordered Arno to bring him his imager so that he could take a hologram with his prisoner. Lesim then complied with Skywalker's request to be taken directly to Vader but not before calling for his imager once more. Another Imperial officer, Commander Igar, ultimately delivered Skywalker to Darth Vader aboard the moon. The story of Skywalker's capture was later recorded by Alliance historian Voren Na'al from reports that Na'al collected from both Skywalker and captured Imperial troops following the Battle of Endor.\nWhile on guard duty outside their AT-AT walker, Arno and his fellow stormtroopers were talking and not taking their job very seriously. They were momentarily stunned by Luke Skywalker turning himself in but complied with the Rebel's mind-trick persuasion, with Skywalker viewing stormtroopers' minds as among the weakest and most easily influenced in the galaxy. The troopers all snapped to attention at the sight of Lesim and warily shrunk away from Skywalker, even with blasters trained on him, upon recognizing his identity as the Rebel who destroyed the first Death Star and dueled with Darth Vader.\nArno was created for the short story \"The Capture of Luke Skywalker,\" published in the 1990 West End Games sourcebook Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi and written by Michael Stern.",
