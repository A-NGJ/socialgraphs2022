 "content": "Locke was a Human male Corellian who served in the Republic Special Forces Division and later the Corellian Security Force during the Cold War and the renewed conflict.\nFollowing the Great Galactic War, Locke served as a loyal veteran in the Republic Special Forces Division until he retired and returned to Corellia where he joined the Corellian Security Force during the Cold War. When the Sith Empire began to invade his planet, he became one of many Corellians who put his past experience to work in the resistance movement.\nIn 3640 BBY, he welcomed Havoc Squad that came to aid in reclaiming Corellia from the Empire.\nGood-natured and swaggering in the Corellian way, Locke was a passionate defender of his world and people. When the Empire invaded, he welcomed the Republic Military's aid reclaiming his homeworld, but had a dim view of the rampant property destruction being inflicted by the non-native troops.",
