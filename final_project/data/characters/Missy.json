 "content": "Missy was a female razor cat that lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, the cub Missy was owned the Corellian woman named Brantlee Spondoon, the assistant to the Diktat of the Corellian sector. In 1 ABY, Missy escaped her mistress and got away into the wilderness all alone. Her desperate mistress soon requested a spacer working for the government to seek for her beloved razor cat. As Spondoon expected, the spacer found Missy along with a dangerous full-grown razor cat. The spacer thus killed the beast and eventually brought back the cub to Brantlee Spondoon.\nMissy appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nMissy was part of the third quest given by Brantlee Spondoon in the original release of the game. This quest was removed from the game with the release of the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, on November 1, 2005, since Brantlee Spondoon was included in a new story arc, i.e., the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This questline was later inserted into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game, with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006.",
