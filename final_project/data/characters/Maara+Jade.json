 "content": "Maara Jade was a clone of the Human Jedi Master Mara Jade Skywalker. She was cloned by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn started his spree of cloning by replacing Anakin Solo with Anaakin Solo. When he got away with that, he went on to switch Skywalker with Maara.\nMaara Jade was mentioned in \"An Apology\", a short story by Timothy Zahn that was released on April 1, 2012 as an April Fool's Day joke. The article in which An Apology was published announced facetiously that Jade would star in upcoming novels. The novel serial, The Clone Wars 2 or Son of Clone Wars, was to continue releasing titles for perpetuity.",
