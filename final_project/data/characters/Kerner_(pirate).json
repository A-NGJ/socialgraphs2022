 "content": "Kerner was a member of a group of pirates that had been stealing shipments of high tech supplies from around Gadrin. The pirates were using a landing platform hidden in Cularin's jungles west of Gadrin. Kerner was assigned with Bont to keep people out of the sector near the landing platform. When a speeder bearing a group of people looking for Darin entered the area, the pirates attempted to shoot them down. Kerner was unprepared for the people in the speeder to shoot back, however. When they did so, he lost control of his speeder bike and crashed.",
