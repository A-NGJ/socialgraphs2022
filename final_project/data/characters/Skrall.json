 "content": "Skrall was the name of a Sleen which escaped from the Coronet Zoo on Corellia around 3640 BBY and was subsequently killed.\nSkrall appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Corellia. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
