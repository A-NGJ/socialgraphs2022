 "content": "A Raydonian mother lived in a village on the Outer Rim planet of Raydonia during the time of the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, the Raydonian village was visited by Dathomirian Zabrak Savage Opress and his brother, Sith Lord Darth Maul. The two sought to attract the attention of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the man who reduced Maul to his current state, by slaughtering the entire population of the village, including this mother, who saw the Zabraks ship approaching and sent her children to it, mistaking it for a supply ship.\nObi-Wan Kenobi later walked past the woman's corpse during his search for Maul.\nThe mother was voiced by Nika Futterman, who also voiced Asajj Ventress in the same episode.\n]",
