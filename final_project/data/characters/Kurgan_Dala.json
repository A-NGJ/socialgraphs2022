 "content": "Kurgan Dala was a male Human starfighter pilot from Naboo.\nAs a child, Dala had always dreamed of becoming a starfighter pilot, but his large size made some worry that he would be too large to become one. Nonetheless, Dala was called to duty in the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Dala was quite happy with his job, but one day on a routine flight with the Comet's Wake, he ran into a space wraith. Dala was unprepared for the the encounter, and the space wraith took a hold of him. After he became wraithbound, Dala began murdering co-workers and generally acting strangely.",
