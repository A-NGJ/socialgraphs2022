 "content": "Jalice Andit was a human female mercenary who lived with her husband Joali in Jedha City on the moon Jedha. The pair thrived in the chaos caused by the Jedha insurgency and were loosely allied with the partisans led by Saw Gerrera on the planet, aiding them in their fight against the Galactic Empire as long as they continued to provide credits and opportunities for violence. Andit was present in Jedha City shortly before it was destroyed by the Empire's Death Star. She had dark skin, black hair and blue eyes.\nJalice Andit was first shown in the reel of promotional footage released for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at Celebration Europe on July 15, 2016. She then went on to appear in the film itself which was released in North America on December 15 later that year. Andit was not named in the film, but received identification in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was released the day after the film.",
