 "content": "Prall was a Hutt who was the head of PharmCorp, a successful business on the planet Nubia. Prall also owned the Nubian Palace, a well known and luxurious resort on the planet. Prall was thin in comparison with most Hutts and was fairly young during the height of the Galactic Empire. Prall rose to power through a series of bribes and favors executed through the Nubian government. Prall was easily distinguished by his tan-gray skin and his different colored eyes. His right eye was blue and his left eye, yellow.",
