 "content": "Durmat was a Human male who served as an Ensign with the Republic during the Cold War, and was the son of the Imperial spy Rylon.\nIn 3643 BBY, Durmat was held prisoner on Balmorra when his father was secretly helping the Empire. While in captivity, he impulsively confessed about his father's true allegiance. He later encountered Darth Baras' apprentice who was sent to kill him. Durmat begged the Sith Warrior to spare him since he was valuable to the Empire, but the Warrior refused his offer and killed him.\nThe Sith Warrior has either the option of killing Durmat  or giving him a drug that would completely wipe his memory . After taking the drug, the Warrior could kill Durmat anyway  or let him live .",
