 "content": "Stim was a human male alive during the Clone Wars.\nStim was created for an unfinished arc of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series that would have featured bounty hunters Boba Fett and Cad Bane, among others. The arc was written by Matt Michnovetz and would have been four episodes long. Stim made a brief appearance in the story reel footage of Fett and Bane's duel shown at Celebration Orlando in 2017, though his name was not known until artist Pat Presley uploaded his concept art for the character, showcasing three possible designs for him as well as the name \"Stim.\"",
