 "content": "Tetran Cowall was Garik \"Face\" Loran's rival when \"Face\" still made holodramas.\nTetran Cowall was in High Winds, a drama about Coruscant tightrope walkers. Later in his career, Cowall began to find little work. He eventually joined Zsinj as an impostor of Baron Soontir Fel, leading a false 181st in an attempt by Zsinj to trap Rogue Squadron in an ambush. Loran described Cowall as having \"no perceivable acting skills\", though his portrayal of Fel was convincing enough to fool even Wedge Antilles, who knew the Baron personally. After his Interceptor was shot down in the Battle of Selaggis, Cowall was left on the surface of the moon Selcaron by Antilles, and was presumably taken prisoner by the New Republic shortly afterwards.",
