 "content": "A domesticated massiff was owned by a tribe of Tusken Raiders on Tatooine in the time following the death of Jabba the Hutt.\nAfter the death of Jabba the Hutt, Boba Fett escaped from the belly of the sarlacc in the Great Pit of Carkoon. A tribe of Tusken Raiders captured the former bounty hunter and took him to their camp. The massiff was tasked with guarding Fett and another prisoner, who were tied to the stumps of two dead trees. During the night, Fett attempted to escape and in the process knocked the massiff out and used its teeth to cut the ropes restraining his wrists. The massiff regained consciousness and chased after the bounty hunter into the desert. The reptile knocked Fett to the ground allowing him to be recaptured by the pursuing Tusken Raiders.\nThe massiff later accompanied one of the tribe's younglings as he led Fett and the Rodian into the desert to dig up black melons. In the process, they woke a sand beast buried beneath the sand. In defense of the youngling, the massiff attacked the creature and was subsequently struck and knocked unconscious. Boba Fett was able to kill the creature with the chain restraining his legs, and the massiff accompanied the child and Fett back to the Tusken camp with the severed head of the sand creature as a prize.\nThe massiff first appeared in \"Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land,\" the first episode of The Book of Boba Fett.",
