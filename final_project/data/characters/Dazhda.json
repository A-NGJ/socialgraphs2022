 "content": "Dazhda was a male Rodian who served as a Sergeant in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Uprising. After the Clone Wars, Dazhda swore to never use a blaster again, but he found himself unable to ignore the Galactic Empire's increasingly despotic rule. After being trapped in the Anoat sector by Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Iron Blockade, he developed a reputation as one of the Alliance's best scouts operating in the sector.\nEventually, Dazhda joined the crew of the Smuggler, who dispatched the Rodian on a variety of missions throughout the Anoat sector.\nDazhda was created by Kabam for Star Wars: Uprising, a canon mobile video game released for iOS and Android operating systems in 2015. The player could send Dazhda on numerous missions for useful items.",
