 "content": "Ziering was a capable and dedicated Imperial General.\nZiering planned to retire to the Corporate Sector shortly after the Battle of Yavin, but was killed by Amanin tribal warriors on Maridun before he could make real his dream. During the Battle of Maridun, General Ziering was so impressed by a young lieutenant named Janek Sunber that he gave the young officer field promotions to captain and later commander. When Amanin warriors destroyed a Juggernaut in a surprise attack at night, Ziering lost his eye. He had great faith in Sunber and his plans, disapproving of Captain Gage's policy of working little and delegating everything to subordinates.",
