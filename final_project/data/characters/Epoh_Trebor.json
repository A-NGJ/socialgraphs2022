 "content": "Epoh Trebor was a famous male HoloNet entertainer who, during the Clone Wars, was a driving force behind the entertainment tours that traveled across the galaxy entertaining Republic troops and personnel on the battlefields. At the time he visited the backwater, war-ridden world of Drongar he was one of the HoloNet's most enduring entertainers and still extremely popular. Some, however, found his humor to be overly sentimental and a bit too party line.\nEpoh Trebor is \"Robert Hope\" backwards, a reference to the legendary comedian Bob Hope. However, Hope's given first name was Leslie.",
