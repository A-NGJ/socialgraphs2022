 "content": "Teemank was a Chadra-Fan female who was the wife of Beesar Tal-Apurna. Though she was afraid of heights, Teemank trained to become a pilot, teaching her wife in addition. Following the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Teemank left to sign up for the Republic Defense Coalition as a pilot, even though they told her that she was too old and that Chadra-Fan did not need the Galactic Republic. Teemank chose to sign up regardless, despite Tal-Apurna begging her not to. Her first deployment was at the Battle of Kur against the Nihil marauders, during which Teemank was killed. Tal-Apurna vowed to avenge her wife's death, spying on the Chadra-Fan doctor Kisma Uttersond, a collaborator of the Nihil.",
