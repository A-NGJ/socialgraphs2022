 "content": "Gleezwuq was a male Rodian criminal who was a member of Blix Lanister's gang during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1.5 ABY, Windy Starkiller resided in the town of Anchorhead on Tatooine. While here, he asked a spacer to find the wanted murderer, Blix Lanister, who had fled town.\nThe spacer agreed to carry out the task, and found Blix shortly thereafter. Blix was brought back to Windy, who paid the spacer 30 credits in thanks. He even said the spacer should consider a career as a security officer. Yet the situation with Blix did not end there. Windy also wanted the spacer to find one of Blix's gang members, a Rodian named Gleezwuq. Gleezwuq was the only member of Blix's gang that Windy did not know the location of. He was sure that Gleezwuq would have evidence which would implicate Blix in his murder of Alita Sweetwater.\nThe spacer managed to find the Rodian gang member, and killed him. On Gleezwuq's person was the same blaster that Blix used in his murder of Alita. The spacer brought the blaster back to an impressed Windy, who was now certain that Blix could be brought to justice.\nGleezwuq was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Players who performed a series of quests for Windy Starkiller had to escort Blix Lanister to Anchorhead, kill Gleezwuq outside of town, and then kill Lanister when he escaped from Anchorhead. The series of quests involved implicating Blix Lanister in the murder of Alita Sweetwater.\nBecause Gleezwuq spawned under the generic \"thug\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of thirty-five possible depictions. Species Gleezwuq could appear as included Aqualish, Bothans, Bith, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak of either gender. Because the quest dialogue identified Gleezwuq as a male Rodian, this article assumes that one of the three randomly generated male Rodian depictions is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. For unknown reasons, Windy was removed from Star Wars Galaxies less than a year after its release, during Publish 6 on February 11, 2004.",
