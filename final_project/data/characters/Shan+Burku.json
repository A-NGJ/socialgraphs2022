 "content": "Shan Burku was a male Human trooper who served as member of the Republic Military during the time of the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. In 3640 BBY, he was stationed on the planet of Corellia, together with two Jedi Tahm and Jace Rendu, until the three were killed by an Imperial-allied individual.\nShan Burku appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on Corellia. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
