 "content": "Brant Sonn was a Human male who served as a loyal subject of House of Organa during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Brant Sonn and his family, along with three hundred Organa citizens, were captured by Baron Jharkus Thul as a distraction after the Republic was able to reclaim the Spears of Organa. When Charle Remmot Organa and a Republic operative arrived to meet the Baron to discuss terms in freeing the prisoners, Jharkus wanted to have the operative as his prisoner since the operative was more valuable. After the operative complied to be taken, Brant Sonn and the prisoners were freed, but he joined the Republic in rescuing the operative, who in turn stopped the Thul advance on House Organa.",
