 "content": "Teff was a Barolian male pilot of the Republic Defense Coalition. He flew a Z-29 Skyhawk in Firebird Squadron, having been transferred from the Kolaador system. After being assigned to Firebird Squadron, Teff encountered an old friend, Jano Brayson, who had also been transferred into the squadron. Shortly afterward, Firebird Squadron was dispatched as part of the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order force in the Battle of Galov against the Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee. Teff, Brayson, and several other pilots boarded Dee's starship of the same name alongside Jedi Knight Nib Assek and Padawan Burryaga Agaburry. They made it to the ship's flight deck, though were unaware that Dee had left a decoy behind, the droid H7-09 wearing her armor and mask. Brayson shot and seemingly killed Dee, but as Teff attempted to remove the mask, explosives Dee had left in the armor detonated. Teff was killed in the explosion, despite the Jedi's attempt to protect the two pilots. Brayson, having survived, was driven to attack captured Nihil aboard Starlight Beacon by his anger over Teff's death.\nTeff appeared in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott.",
