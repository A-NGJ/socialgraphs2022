 "content": "The Dofine family was an important family from Neimoidia. Trade Federation captains Daultay and Lushros Dofine were both well-known members of this family. Daultay was the commanding officer of the last Droid Control Ship stationed in orbit after the rest of the blockade had left during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Daultay was killed when Anakin Skywalker destroyed the control ship under his command. Lushros was the captain of the Invisible Hand, the Separatist flagship of General Grievous during the Battle of Coruscant in 19 BBY. Lushros was killed when his escape pod was hit by a stray laser blast.",
