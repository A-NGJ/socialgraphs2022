 "content": "This long-faced humanoid worked as a bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War.\nThis bounty hunter was part of a bounty hunter group on Centares shortly after the Battle of Yavin. When the name of the Rebel pilot who destroyed the first Death Star was revealed, Vader and his stormtroopers killed the hunter and every other individual who heard it.\nThis unidentified individual was created by Star Wars artist Dave Gibbons for Vader's Quest 1 of the Vader's Quest series of comics, published in 1999 by Dark Horse Comics.\nThis bounty hunter's species was not specified in the comic book, but he shares traits with the H'drachi.",
