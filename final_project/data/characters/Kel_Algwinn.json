 "content": "Kel Algwinn was a male Human student at the Sith Academy on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War.\nAlthough Algwinn considered himself weak, in actuality he was not as corrupted by the dark side as the other Sith hopefuls. This caused him to have doubts about his place at the Academy. When the Jedi and former Sith Lord Revan infiltrated the Academy in his search for the Star Map on the planet, he attempted to persuade Algwinn to become a Jedi. Algwinn was conflicted by the different viewpoints presented to him, but before he could come to a decision, he was killed when the residents of the Academy attacked Revan after discovering that he was a spy.\nAlthough canonically Kel Algwinn does not join the Jedi Order, the player as Revan can successfully persuade him to do so, at which point he departs from the academy. If the player suggests that Kel join the Jedi before the destruction of Dantooine, he or she can talk to him in the training room of the Jedi Enclave, where Kel is now dressed as a Jedi Padawan.\nIf the player is a dark-side character, after discovering Kel's doubts, Revan can: tell Uthar Wynn or Yuthura Ban about themâ€”after which Kel disappears from the academy, taunt him into fighting and kill him, or speak with him and convince him that the dark side is where he belongs.",
