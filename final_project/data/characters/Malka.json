 "content": "Malka was a Human male Colonel who served in the Imperial Navy, and served aboard Admiral Mils Giel's flagship during the Galactic Civil War. Giel's loyal right-hand man, Malka was demoted alongside Giel after they were tasked with transporting the powerful teezl creature to Coruscant, an operation that met with disastrous failure due to Alliance sabotage. Malka died five years later on Beheboth, the victim of another of Giel's schemes.\nA Human male, Malka served as an officer in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War, serving as a Colonel and as the right-hand man of Admiral Mils Giel by 3 ABY. Malka was at Giel's side during the Imperial mission to transport a captured communications amplifier called the teezl to the Imperial capital, when the armada led by Giel's flagship was attacked by a group of Rebels piloting modified TIE/LN starfighters. The Imperials were caught off guard, but reacted quickly by having the teezl transmit interference on all communication channels but the Imperial war band. This prevented the Rebels from being able to use their special communicators to recognize each other. However, Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker positioned his fighter to target Giel's battleship, and opened fire disabling the ship and destroying the teezl. Malka panicked as a result, but Giel calmly took command and dispatched a squad of fighters to capture Skywalker. Skywalker ultimately escaped, and both Giel and Malka were demoted and reassigned to Golrath Station as a result of their failure.\nMonths later, a Rebel Alliance operation led by Princess Leia Organa sabotaged Golrath Station, causing the reactor core of the facility to overload and explode. The now-Sergeant Malka and Lieutenant Giel boarded an Imperial troop transport shuttle and escaped from the devastation. Their ship suffered minor damage from the blast however, and they were forced to crash-land on the nearby planet Beheboth. Stranded on the arid world, Malka loyally assisted Giel in a plan to enslave the powerful Tirrith entities that lived on the planet. They worked alongside a Quarren scientist and engineered a condenser unit that could contain the Tirrith creatures. They invested five years worth of their lives into the plan—a scheme that ultimately failed. During their subsequent attempt to escape from local law enforcement officer Darial Anglethorn, Giel pushed Malka into the line of fire. A blaster bolt meant for Giel hit Malka and killed him. Giel then set off an explosion and escaped Beheboth.\nMalka was fiercely loyal to Mils Giel. After Giel was reduced in rank by Darth Vader, Malka continued to address him as Admiral. During his stay on Beheboth, Malka developed a secondary hobby—writing. He chronicled the affairs of his superior officer and recorded everything onto a datapad. Malka hoped to one day publish Giel's memoirs as a holonovel.\nMalka appeared in two issues of the original Marvel Star Wars comic run in 1982, where he was illustrated by Walt Simonson and Tom Palmer. Malka's ultimate fate was later provided in 2004, in Cory J. Herndon's Wizards of the Coast article Beheboth: Blood and Water.",
