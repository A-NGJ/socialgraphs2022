 "content": "Half-Moonsing was a male Weequay Jedi and the caretaker of the speeder pool at the Coruscant Jedi Temple in the finals years of the Galactic Republic. While he failed to pass the Jedi Trials, Half-Moonsing was permitted to stay in the Temple while maintaining the title of Jedi.\nBrought to the Temple at a very young age, Half-Moonsing graduated from the Jedi academy and was selected by a Jedi Master for training as a Padawan. Accompanying his master for years, Half-Moonsing was recommended for the Jedi Trials and returned to Coruscant to undergo the tests. Despite his training however, Half-Moonsing failed the Trials and was not permitted to continue along the Jedi Path. However, Half-Moonsing decided to stay at the Temple, taking up a post in the docking complex, specifically the speeder pool. As of about 115 BBY, Half-Moonsing had become the caretaker of the speeder pool, overseeing all of the Temple's speeder craft and ensuring they were checked out properly. Half-Moonsing was noted for his deep insight and being a helpful part of the Temple staff, remaining in his post until he passed away sometime between 72 and 44 BBY.\nWhile it did not make it into the finished edition, Dan Wallace, author of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, revealed that he believed Half-Moonsing to be a Weequay.",
