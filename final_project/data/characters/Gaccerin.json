 "content": "Gaccerin was a female Human who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the conflict, she served the Empire as an Imperial Agent in Imperial Intelligence and worked on board the space station Vaiken Spacedock, located within the Imperial fleet. Gaccerin worked selling equipment to other Imperials in the station's supply section, and while doing so wore gray armor including a helmet and also made use of a hand-held holoprojector. She had brown eyes and fair skin.\nGaccerin was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game she serves as an Imperial elite gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. She was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, she remains in the game, as her character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
