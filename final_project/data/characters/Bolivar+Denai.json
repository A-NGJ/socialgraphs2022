 "content": "Bolivar Denai was a human male who spent time in Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. At this time, he was amongst a group who gathered to watch the scavenger Rey fight off a pair of thugs that had been sent by the junk dealer Unkar Plutt to capture the astromech droid BB-8. Rey successfully defeated her attackers with her quarterstaff, causing them to flee and the crowd of watchers to disperse. Shortly after the fight ended, the First Order attacked Niima in search of BB-8. While in Niima, Denai wore brown clothing and a red hat with a large peak.\nBolivar Denai first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The actor playing the character was uncredited and the character did not receive a name in the film, but was identified by the video game Disney Infinity 3.0, which was released in conjunction with the film. Despite the game being non-canon, story group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed on Twitter that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including Denai, were considered canon.",
