 "content": "Brady was a Human male who served as an Admiral in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the failure of Colonel Braedic Ekirk to rid the galaxy of vacant houses and structures, Brady was given this task instead. He met with Colonel Hoot aboard a Star Destroyer and told him of his plans for doing this. Brady believed that the Rebel Alliance were using abandoned houses as meeting places and he believed that he could inspire Imperial troops to destroy these houses, by offering them them rewards.",
