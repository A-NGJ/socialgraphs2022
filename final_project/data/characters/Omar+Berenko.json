 "content": "Omar Berenko was a famous and controversial human Naboo male tragic poet from the Mid Rim planet Naboo who lived during the High Republic Era. Berenko resided at Varykino, a lake retreat in Naboo's Lake Country, in an unconventional community of Naboo and Gungan outsiders. Varykino Villa's Room of Morning Mists was a favored composing spot of his, where he wrote the epic and disturbing poem \"Defense of Naboo\" and several other famous works.\nAround 232 BBY, Jedi Master Avar Kriss and Jedi Knight Elzar Mann visited the San Tekka compound near Varykino. The island caught Kriss' eye, and Mann spoke to her about Berenko, who was living there at the time. Mann noted that Berenko had a reputation for brilliance.\nEventually, Berenko was mysteriously kidnapped from the villa's terrace by unknown assailants, at the spot where Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala would secretly marry in 22 BBY. After his abduction, the poet was never seen again.\nOmar Berenko was first canonically mentioned in the 2016 edition of the reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations. The segment mentioning Omar Berenko was first published as part of the Star Wars Legends continuity in the 2003 reference book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, written by Simon Beecroft and Curtis Saxton.\nBerenko shares his name with House Berenko and New Republic Senator Thadlé Berenko, both of which also hail from Naboo. Any connection beyond the name has not been confirmed.",
