 "content": "Ghulil was a Mon Calamari male commander and war veteran who served the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. Towards the end of the Cold War, Ghulil was aboard the Republic starship Brentaal Star when it was transporting the Imperial defector known as \"The General\" and helped to defend it when it was attacked by the Imperial transport Black Talon. When Imperial forces boarded the Brentaal Star to retrieve The General, Ghulil confronted their leader and was killed.\nGhulil first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he is the second boss of the Imperial Flashpoint \"The Black Talon.\" According to the game's text files, the Black Talon Flashpoint originally included a conversation cutscene with Ghulil prior to the fight with him; Ghulil would have identified himself as \"Special Forces Commander Ghulilâ€”honored hero of the Dac Military Academy.\"",
