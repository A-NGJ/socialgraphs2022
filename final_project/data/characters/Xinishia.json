 "content": "Xinishia was a female Tarasin, who was a member of the Wyrd, a group of Force witches who operated on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nXinishia was one of the lieutenants of Liriana, the leader of the Wyrd. During the Clone Wars, Liriana traveled off-planet, so Xinishia used her leader's absence as an opportunity to try and make herself leader of the Wyrd. She discovered a dark side artifact that enhanced her Force powers and planned to use it to cause Cloud Mountain, an inert volcano, to erupt and destroy the village Kiirloor. However, the heroes of Cularin attempted to stop her.",
