 "content": "Jelasi was a Hutt whom many believed was to be the heir of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire. After Jabba's death, chaos took hold of clan Desilijic. After a brutal round of infighting, Jelasi, along with Kumac emerged as joint clan leader. In the wake of Jabba's death, Jelasi assumed control of the Ig'zxyck Flare organization and began to \"legitimize\" Hutt criminal activities. This earned him the ire of many Hutts, including Kumac, during the early years of the New Republic. Jelasi earned the business of much of the Imperial Remnant during this time, as the Empire tried to maintain a low-key approach to regaining power. A year later, Zorba Desilijic Tiure was released from the prison planet Kip and found his son's true will and testament. Through the courts, Zorba claimed everything that was legally due to him, and control of Desilijic was wrested away from the hands of Kumac and Jelasi.",
