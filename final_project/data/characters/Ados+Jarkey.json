 "content": "Ados Jarkey was a male Twi'lek who lived on Naboo during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was the father of Fenrol and Hunnos Jarkey. His son Hunnos was a murderer wanted by the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Some time after the Battle of Yavin, agents of the Violent Crimes Division interrogated him about his escaped son. In the meantime, his other son Fenrol killed himself in a speeder bike accident.\nAdos Jarkey appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ados Jarkey was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
