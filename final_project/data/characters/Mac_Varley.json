 "content": "Mac Varley was a Human male Corellian Security Force captain who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He eventually deserted CorSec, and was taken into custody by a spacer sent by private investigator Denell Kel'Vannon.\nMac Varley was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Mac Varley spawned under the generic \"corsec_deserter\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of four possible depictions. He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male wearing either an officer's uniform or a pilot's jumpsuit, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female wearing either the officer's uniform or pilot's jumpsuit. Because the quest dialogue identified Varley as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, the type of clothing he wore cannot be definitively determined.",
