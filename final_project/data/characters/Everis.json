 "content": "Everis was a male Chagrian doctor affiliated with the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. Stationed on Belsavis, Everis was among the scientists working on the Project Noble Focus, which forced alien inmates of different species to compete against each other to learn their strenths and weaknesses. However, around 3641 BBY a riot broke out and many of the prisoners involved in the project got free. In particular, a group of escaped Gand went insane, hunting down those respobsible for their torture and capturing many of Everis' colleagues. Realizing the horror of the project, Everis begged a Republic citizen to rescue the prisoners from the Gand.\nDoctor Everis appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an NPC on Belsavis, where he begins the heroic mission \"A Lesson is Learned.\"",
