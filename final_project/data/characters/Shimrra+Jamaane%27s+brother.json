 "content": "Shimrra Jamaane's brother was the twin of the Yuuzhan Vong Shimrra Jamaane who would become Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong empire. Twins were very uncommon in Yuuzhan Vong history, with only three documented sets of twins in the entire existence of the species. Extreme importance was thus attached to both Shimrra and his brother from their birth. The twins fought one another at the early age of seven, as Yuuzhan Vong law dictated. Shimrra's brother was killed, paving the way for the victorious—and vicious—twin to become a candidate for the Yuuzhan Vong leadership.",
