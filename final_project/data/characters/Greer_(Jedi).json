 "content": "Greer was a Rodian Jedi Padawan learner who attended Jedi academy at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in 196 BBY, at the same time as Roan Novachez. While he and Roan were in an uneasy relationship, Roan had identified him as a 3 percent threat. Eventually they were forced to do a project together, along with Cyrus, Cronah, and Jo-Ahn. During his third year he would be dispatched by Roan Novachez in the Jedi Labyrinth Trial and graduate with his fellow Classmates.\nGreer was short and had green, mottled skin. He wore the traditional Jedi robes.\nGreer was quiet and neutral, traits that led him to getting the Yearbook Award for being \"hardest to understand.\" He was moderately talented in lightsaber fencing, as he was able to hold off Gaiana briefly before being dispatched in the Lightsaber Fencing Tournament.",
