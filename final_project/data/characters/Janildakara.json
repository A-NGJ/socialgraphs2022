 "content": "Janildakara was a bounty hunter who was a member of the House Renliss chapter of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. A young Human female, she had a prominent slave brand on her neck.\nWhen she was young, Janildakara was captured by pirates and sold as a slave to the Zygerrian Slavers Guild. She finally escaped many years later. As she was unable to track down her parents, she joined House Renliss in the hopes that the guild would be able to help her find her family. While working for House Renliss, Janildakara developed an interest in poisons. House Renliss exploited this interest, and her fragile emotional state, in order to turn Janildakara into an effective weapon for the guild's use.\nHaving suffered extensively at the hands of slavers, Janildakara was consumed with hatred and resentments.\nJanildakara was a skilled poisoner, who was particularly good at creating imaginative toxins. Janildakara was also adept at using throwing knives, coating the blades in various poisons prior to use.\nJanildakara was usually equipped with an armored half-vest, throwing knives, various custom-made poisons, a hold-out blaster, and a stun cloak.",
