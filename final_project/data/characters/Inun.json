 "content": "Inun was a Twi'lek male who lived on the Ryloth colony planet Aaloth as a member of the world's lead family. He had two older sisters, Haleena and Lourna Dee. At some point, Inun and Dee rode blurrgs on Aaloth's southplains, though Dee was injured. Shortly after, Dee, along with her lover Bala Waleen, conspired to have herself installed as the world's keeper, and the family's palace was stormed by a mob of starving citizens. Dee was betrayed by Waleen and sold into slavery, and the rest of her family were executed. After escaping from slavery, Dee enrolled at the Carida Military Academy under Inun's name.\nInun appeared in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast.",
