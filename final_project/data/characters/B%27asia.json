 "content": "B'asia was a young Togruta female who resided at the orphanage of Killi Gimm in Jedha City. During the Galactic Empire's occupation of Jedha, Imperial stormtroopers raided Gimm's orphanage in search of contraband. When stormtroopers pushed Gimm to the ground, B'asia became frightened, and she hid under her bed. When a stormtrooper tried to remove B'asia from her hiding place, he grabbed her by her montrals, and when B'asia resisted, the stormtrooper struck her. When the raid concluded, Gimm, B'asia, and the other orphans were relocated to a home near the Second Spire. Later, she and thirty-three other orphans were able to escape Jedha in a stolen Imperial shuttle.",
