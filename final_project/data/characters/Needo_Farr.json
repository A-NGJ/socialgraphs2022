 "content": "Needo Farr was a male Rodian from Rodia who served as a member of the Legislative Youth Program during the Separatist Crisis.\nIn 22 BBY, Farr and his fellow trainees traveled to Chandrila's capital, Hanna City, for a simulation of the vote on the Military Creation Act, a bill that authorized the creation of a Republic army. Unlike Naboo delegate Dash√© Borreno, he voted in favor of the act. The \"Yes\" side won by a margin of 52 to 48 percent.\nNeedo Farr made his first and only appearance in the HoloNet News Vol. 531 50 article Legislative Youth Program Role-Plays Vote. It was published in 2002 on the HoloNet News website.",
