 "content": "Smalyun was a male Human captain in the Bank of Aargau Security's customs division during the era of the Galactic Civil War. Inexperienced his post as a security officer at Planetary Customs Security Checkpoint LH48 as of 3 ABY, Smalyun struggled with lateness early in his new role, but impressed supervisors by mastering the checkpoint's holoscanner in record time.\nSmalyun was secretly a contact of notorious smuggler Li-Suun Niik, and not long after his new posting he overlooked one of Niik's men attempting to pass through the scanner with illegal gold bonded to two of his ribs. Sergeant-at-Arms Rolex informed Smalyun of his \"error,\" and Smalyun responded by killing the man without hesitation.\nSmalyun first appeared in Star Wars  48, written by Larry Hama and released in 1981. In the comic, Smalyun was illustrated by Carmine Infantino. Although he goes unnamed in his initial appearance, he was finally named in the 2003 Wizards of the Coast article Aargau: For All Your Banking Needs.",
