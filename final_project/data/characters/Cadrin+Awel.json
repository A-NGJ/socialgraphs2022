 "content": "Cadrin Awel was a female Human who was romantically linked to General Stavin Thaal. As a teenager, Awel performed as a singer but was unable to make an impact on Coruscant after winning local contests on her homeworld. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Awel and her family hid on Vandor-3 to evade notice from the Yuuzhan Vong. Before the Second Galactic Civil War, Awel established a boot camp on Vandor-3 for people to learn nature skills. Her relationship with Thaal went undocumented and she was last recorded as having married a fellow wartime survivor in 42 ABY.",
