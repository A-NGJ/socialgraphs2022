 "content": "Tooth was a native Molavaran leading a convoy of settlers on Molavar. Upon arriving on Molavar, former mercenary Darca Nyl journeyed with Tooth's convoy for some time. Later, Darca called upon Tooth's people to help a local homesteader, Byrom, from a criminal gang led by Magon. They were successful and Tooth and his convoy settled down near Byrom's land to start a new life.",
