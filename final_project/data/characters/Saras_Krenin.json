 "content": "Saras Krenin was a female Rodian bounty hunter of House Benelex. She was the associate of several Rodians killed by Han Solo, and she found a particular joy in hunting the Corellian smuggler down, though even she realized the chances of her capturing him were slight. She would drop a current assignment if a chance at capturing Solo presented itself.\nKrenin, upon receiving her assignment from her House Benelex coordinator, would hold expensive, lavish parties to announce it, providing her with eager informants , and often scaring her quarry into revealing themselves by bolting; upon learning the location of her prey, she would act swiftly and take the first opportunity to capture them.\nShe was known to use Rodian razor-sticks.",
