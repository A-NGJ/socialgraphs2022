 "content": "Ratter was a Trandoshan male big game hunter who hunted alongside a hunting lodge made up of other Trandoshan game hunters. Led by Garnac, the guild hunted both non-sentient creatures and sentient beings, the latter of which were captured and dumped on the moon of Wasskah. In 20 BBY, Ratter took part in a hunting outing on the eve of Garnac's son's initiation into the guild. During the hunt, Ratter and his partner Sochek tracked down a Terrelian Jango Jumper and a Snivvian, the latter of which Ratter shot to death.\nA few days later the hunting guild's floating headquarters were ambushed by a group of prisoners led by the captured Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Ratter aided in the defense of the floating fortress, and briefly managed to subdue Tano's force. However, the attackers were reinforced by Wookiee soldiers that had been contacted earlier. Ratter attempted to duel the Wookiee Chewbacca, but was thrown overboard to his death when the captured Jedi youngling O-Mer intervened to save Chewbacca's life. Garnac's entire guild fell shortly thereafter.\nRatter was a Trandoshan male big game hunter who was a member of a hunting guild spearheaded by the Trandoshan hunter Garnac. Like Ratter and Garnac, all of the guild's members were exclusively Trandoshan. Among the guild's trophies were many non-sentient creatures from across the galaxy. However, the guild also happened to have a knack for kidnapping sentient beings as well, who were then marooned on the moon of Wasskah and subsequently hunted by the Trandoshans for sport.\nDuring the year 20 BBY, a slew of new prisoners were dropped onto Wasskah's Island Four, courtesy of the guild's Trandoshan prisoner ship and its crew. The hunt took place the day after their arrival, and Ratter was present in the trophy room of the guild's floating fortress headquarters when Garnac officially announced the hunt's beginning. Ratter and the other hunters took up arms as they cheered and celebrated the hunt. For the hunt, Ratter joined fellow hunters Lo-Taren and Sochek and boarded an MSP80 Pteropter hover pod that Ratter then piloted to Wasskah's surface.\nEventually, the pair came across two of the new arivals—the Snivvian Katt Mol and the Terrelian Jango Jumper Lika. Ratter stealthily positioned themselves in the canopy above the pair of targets, which allowed the hunters to take their prey unaware. Ratter opened fire first and scored a killing blow on Mol before he opened up with both of his blaster pistols on Lika. The Jango Jumper made a run for it, and Ratter prodded Sochek to take the shot, which he did. The hunt eventually ended, and the Trandoshans returned to the gloating fortress.\nThat night, Ratter partook in the celebrating of the induction ceremony for Garnac's son, Dar. The young Trandoshan was made an official member of the guild, and was given the chance to lead the next day's hunt. However, Dar was killed by his prospective quarry, the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano.\nA few days later, Tano had rallied two other stranded Jedi younglings, O-Mer and Jinx, to fight against the Trandoshans with her. Together, they managed to board and crash the Trandoshan freighter, killing pilots Clutch and Goron and freeing the Wookiee prisoner Chewbacca in the process. The following morning, Ratter and the other Trandoshans investigated the crash site. While Garnac and Lo-Taren discussed the nature of the attack, Ratter helped Krix pull Clutch's body from the wreckage of the freighter and carry it away.\nLater on, Tano's group hijacked a hover pod from Krix and flew it to Garnac's fortress for a straight-forward assault on the Trandoshans. Attacking the hunters Lagon and Ramy first, Lagon was thrown overboard, prompting Ramy to call for assistance. Ratter, who had been standing by alongside the hunter Gilas, was among the first to respond, with Garnac, Lo-Taren, and Sochek joining in on the base's defense soon after. When Ramy attempted to board a hover pod, the Jedi used the Force to pick up the pod and Ramy and throw it towards Ratter and Gilas, who lost their blasters as they dove for cover.\nUpon getting back to his feet Ratter one-on-one dueled Chewbacca, with both combatants getting their punches in. However, the Jedi assault was thrown off when Garnac shot O-Mer's stolen hover pod out of the sky and sent it crashing onto the fortress's landing pad. Chewbacca was knocked to the ground, and Ratter grabbed his dropped sniper rifle to hold him there. Garnac congratulated Chewbacca and the Jedi on their resolve, but before he could give the order to kill them, Wookiee reinforcements arrived aboard the starship Halo.\nThe fight resumed, with Chewbacca taking Ratter by surprise and disarming him of the blaster pistol. As Ratter's comrades began to fall in battle, the Trandoshan continued to brawl Chewbacca and eventually achieved the upper hand. O-Mer intervened, hitting Ratter with a rifle and distracting Ratter long enough for Chewbacca to push Ratter off of the fortress and to his death below.\nGarnac was killed by Tano shortly thereafter, and the guild was brought to an end.\nRatter was a tall, thin Trandoshan hunter who displayed great joy in taking out his targets. However, he was not without compliment, as he admired the speed of the Terrelian Jango Jumper Lika after she escaped one of his attacks. During Dar's initiation ceremony and the hunt that occurred immediately before it, Ratter was just as excited as the other Trandoshans as the events transpired, and took part in a great deal of whooping and cheering for them.\nRatter was skilled in hand-to-hand combat and was able to hold his own against the Wookiee Chewbacca for some time, and even managed to trap the Wookiee under his foot. However, Ratter's concentration on his one target turned out to be the death of him, as he had failed to remain aware of his surroundings and was subsequently attacked and distracted by O-Mer, giving Chewbacca a chance to overcome his opponent.\nRatter had light green scales covering his body, with his arms displaying a yellow and green stripe that twisted down the length of them. Ratter also had yellow eyes.\nRatter was utilized a variety of weapons during his final hunts on Wasskah. Among these weapons were a pair of blaster pistols that he used to hunt down Katt Mol and Lika with. During the attack on Garnac's fortress, Ratter briefly wielded a sniper rifle before he was disarmed with it, though he later recovered it, although again only briefly. Ratter was also known to fly one of the guild's hover pods, which served the guild as heavily armed combat speeders.\nDuring his final days, Ratter wore dark green clothes, which included a tank-top with a yellow neck lining. Ratter alos wore a set of tactical overalls, which were equipped with a variety of pouches with yellow markings on them. In addition, Ratter wore kneepads, ankle braces, and had an electronically powered gauntlet on his right-handed wrist.\nRatter was created as one of the many Trandoshan extras to appear in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episodes \"Padawan Lost\" and \"Wookiee Hunt,\" both of which aired on April 1, 2011 as a part of the show's third season. Although not named in dialogue, Ratter's name was given in the credits for \"Padawan Lost,\" where his voice was listed as being given by Matt Lanter.\nLike all of the Trandoshans in the episodes, Ratter was designed by Pat Presley. Ratter's thin-bodied appearance was created during a deliberate effort to create varied body types for the Trandoshan characters in order to make them distinct from Bossk, a Trandoshan that appeared earlier in the series. Ratter's name comes from that of a real-life reptile: the rattlesnake.\nDuring the production of \"Padawan Lost,\" Ratter was to be equipped with active camouflage technology, similar to what was seen in the film Predator. The concept was scrapped, however.\nRatter also played a role in two scenes cut from the episode. In the first scene, Ratter and Lo-Taren were to have personally hunted down Katt Mol and the Sakiyan Vadoo—a variation of this occurs in the finished episode, where Ratter kills Katt Mol and Lo-Taren kills Vadoo, albeit on separate occasions. In a second deleted scene, Ratter and Lo-Taren hunted O-Mer and Jinx while using the aforementioned camo-technology, only to be foiled and thrown off of a cliff, after which they were rescued by Sochek in his hover pod.",
