 "content": "Tione Zrar was a Pau'an female who worked as a consular with Urma Athantras and Velai. When she and her companions prepared to defend a village from a group of pirates attempting to extort them, Zrar studied the pirate captain, Arra Somori. Zrar discovered that Somori was the daughter of the village's leader, Thissa Somori, and that the crew owed a large debt to the Hutts. When Velai convinced the pirates to enter negotiations with the villagers, Zrar used her discoveries to lead both groups into reluctant cooperation.",
