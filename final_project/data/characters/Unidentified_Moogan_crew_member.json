 "content": "This Moogan smuggler was part of Tee Va's crew of smugglers active during the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, because the planet Mandalore opted for neutrality in the Clone Wars, supply lines had been severed from the Republic, and the inhabitants had to rely on black markets for food and other necessary needs. This smuggler, along with a few Gotal servants, and Tee Va, another Moogan, traveled to Mandalore to deliver tea. But Tee Va decided to double the profit by adding slabin to the tea, which in turn made it poisonous. One night, when the crew arrived at night to deliver more tea, this Moogan smuggler met with the customs officer and bribed him into letting them work. However, they were caught the next day by Duchess Satine Kryze, the Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala, who had come to investigate the corruption, a few of Satine's bodyguards, and a police captain. A firefight ensued, which resulted in the deaths of one of the Moogan smugglers, two Gotals, and two royal Mandalorian guards. The surviving smugglers were then arrested.\nNear the end of the episode, one of Tee Va's companions is killed by Padmé Amidala, but it is unknown if it was this Moogan smuggler or Tee Va's other companion.",
