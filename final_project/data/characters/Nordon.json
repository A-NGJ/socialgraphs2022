 "content": "Nordon was a male Twi'lek pilot who served his planet in Cham Syndulla's Free Ryloth Movement. He played a major role in the events following the Destruction of the Star Destroyer Perilous.\nDuring the Perilous' destruction, Darth Vader and Emperor Sheev Palpatine escaped in a personal shuttle. While they attempted to escape, Isval, another member of Cham Syndulla's movement, flew an escort craft to the scene to intercept. She was Force choked by Vader, but managed to ram her ship into that of the two Sith. Their shuttle crashed in Ryloth's equatorial forest.\nNordon piloted a recon team to the site of the crash to investigate and hunt for survivors. Vader and the Emperor saw his ship and used telekinesis to ram it into the ground. Nordon and the rest of his crew died. Isval later found his body being devoured by Gutkurrs",
