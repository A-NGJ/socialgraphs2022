 "content": "Ajuva Vanasterin was an individual responsible for giving out dinner invitations.\nDuring 1 ABY, Ajuva resided in the city of Restuss on Rori. She grew so tired of arguments between citizens of Restuss and Narmle concerning which town was better, so she sought to organize a dinner party for those who wanted to just come together.\nShe tasked a spacer with the responsibility of personally giving a dinner invitation to her close friend, Jinderliss Prason. The spacer carried out the task, and was paid several credits for the trouble.\nBefore the Battle of Restuss erupted, Ajuva was apparently evacuated from the city by the Empire.\nAjuva Vanasterin was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. She was removed from the game on June 27, 2006, due to the new changes that were made to Restuss.",
