 "content": "Stanfeld Duffit was the Human male mayor of Montrol City, the capital of Gandle Ott in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. In 8 ABY, Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne's defeat at Kal'Shebbol by the New Republic led him to retreat to Gandle Ott. After stripping the planet of its defense force and governor, the Moff departed and left the planet in confusion. The New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived days later, and began opening diplomatic relations with the planet. During the course of the four-day visit, Duffit extended several courtesies to the FarStar delegation in the hopes that associating himself with the New Republic would be beneficial to his city.\nStanfeld Duffit was a Human male who lived on Gandle Ott in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. By 8 ABY, he served as the mayor of the planet's capital, Montrol City, and maintained an estate in the Residential District. Duffit was proud of his city, which was considered impressive for such a remote planet, and of CUTH-BRT-92-X3, the BRT supercomputer that helped to run Montrol City's automated systems.\nIn 8 ABY, the Imperial warlord who controlled the sector, Moff Kentor Sarne, was forced from his capital on Kal'Shebbol by the New Republic. Sarne retreated to Gandle Ott, where he stripped the system of its defense force and governor before departing. With Gandle Ott thrown into confusion, two figures emerged as rivals for control of the planet: Marja Lang, the Vice-Governor who had been left behind by Sarne, and General Herron Dade, commander of the planetary militia. Several days later, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar arrived pursuing Sarne. Duffit was part of a governmental delegation that met the command crew of the FarStar at Montrol Spaceport.\nOn the second day of the FarStar's visit, Duffit conducted them on a tour of Montrol City, showing them the sights and locations he felt would appeal to representatives of the New Republic, including the former Jedi chapter house, the art museums, industrial locations, courts and the Computer Center, where he introduced them to CUTH-BRT-92-X3. On the third day, he hosted a dinner party at his estate, inviting both the New Republic officials as well as several hundred business leaders and supporters of General Dade. Duffit hoped to attract new business to Gandle Ott, and knew that he would benefit from any association with the New Republic regardless of who ascended to the leadership of the planet. After several days visiting the planet and establishing diplomatic ties, the FarStar left Gandle Ott to continue its pursuit of Moff Sarne.\nStanfeld Duffit had black receding hair and a mustache. As mayor of Montrol City, he was immensely proud of his city, and took every opportunity he could to show it off and to attract new commerce. He had enough political experience to realize that an association with the New Republic would be beneficial both for himself and Montrol City, regardless of who won control of the planet between Herron Dade and Marja Lang.\nStanfeld Duffit appeared in Death Is Remotely Possible, the third RPG adventure in The DarkStryder Campaign published by West End Games in 1995.",
