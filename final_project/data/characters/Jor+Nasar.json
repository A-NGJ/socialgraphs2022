 "content": "Jor Nasar was a Human male Dread Commander of the Dread Host during the Dread War. He was stationed on Oricon in 3638 BBY patrolling the outer sections perimeter and hangars of the Dread Fortress when he was killed.\nJor Nasar is one of seven Dread Host Commanders who serve as part of the Oricon planetary quest line in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel. As part of the final mission of that quest line a Republic or Imperial player is tasked with killing these commanders and destroying transports in order to prevent the spread of the Dread Masters' fear across the galaxy. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
