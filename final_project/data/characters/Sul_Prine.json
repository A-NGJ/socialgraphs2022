 "content": "Sul Prine was a male Human speeder bike racer who lived on the core world Talus during the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he owned a house near the city of Dearic. In 1 ABY, the technology-hating Meatlump gang smashed several speeder bikes that were parked outside his house. He had known of them on Corellia, but had never run into any on Talus before. Prine knew it was them because he found one of their typical jackets left behind and a map to one of their camps. When Vani Korr, a reporter with the Corellia Times who was investigating the Meatlumps learned of this attack, she asked an adventurer to look into it for her. Prine talked to the adventurer and gave the spacer the map he had found. Prine hoped that the adventurer would make them pay for the destroyed speeder bikes. The spacer did good use of the map and managed to find the location of the Meatlump Camps on Talus. The adventurer eventually attacked the camp, killing some Meatlumps in the process.\nSul Prine was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. He was added to the game with \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008 as part of the quest that gave the player access to the Meatlumps Theme Park, a series of quests for the Meatlumps.",
