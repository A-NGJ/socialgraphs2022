 "content": "Nexus Wan was a Human female Jedi who was active during the reign of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire between 130 ABY and 138 ABY. Wan had white eyes, light skin, and black hair shaven on one side with a long braid falling down her back.\nNexus Wan was clothed in a white outfit comprised of a coat and pants. Large armored shoulder pads accented the outfit. On her face, Wan wore blue lipstick with white face paint and a singular horizontal black line running across her eyes. Wan also wielded two teal double-bladed lightsabers.\nNexus Wan is a character created for Red Fly Studio's canceled video game Battle of the Sith Lords. She was designed to be one of several Jedi adversaries, including Bix Creo and Gareth Lorca, whom Maul's descendant would have encountered throughout the game.\nConcept artist Thomas A. Szakolczay designed Nexus Wan's appearance at some point prior to the game's cancelation in 2011. Szakolczay took inspiration from the 1982 film Blade Runner when naming Wan and posited that she had a \"brazen\" personality.",
