 "content": "Sardeya Elgrin was a female Mon Calamari engineer who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, the disbarred droid engineer Sardeya Elgrin lived on the planet Lok. She inhabited a cave located in the heart of a volcano, the Mount Chaolt. There, she performed lawless experiments that would not allowed on any of the more civilized worlds, experimenting to improve the droid lethal capacities.\nIn 1 ABY, the outcast Andria E'liyha tried to convince a spacer to attack the cave in order to kill the insane engineer and remove insanity from Lok. Later, the Trandoshan bounty hunters Bossk and Balfur Jhcor discovered the presence of Sardeya Elgrin on Lok. Bossk proposed to a spacer encountered on Corellia to split the bounty. The adventurer therefore traveled to Lok and tracked the engineer to the cave. The spacer attacked Sardeya Elgrin and finally killed her.\nSardeya Elgrin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The droid engineer of the Droid Engineer's Cave was first mentioned upon the original release of the game. but was only added to the game with the \"Game Update 10\", released on June 2, 2009.",
