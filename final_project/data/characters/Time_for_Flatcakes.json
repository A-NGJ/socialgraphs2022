 "content": "Time for Flatcakes was a deaf and blind male racing fathier out of Kreegah who was kept at the Canto Bight racetrack on the planet Cantonica. During the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance, he was purchased by the Suerton gamblers known as the Lucky Three on behalf of their friend Kaljach Sonmi. Shortly after his purchase, Time for Flatcakes participated in a race while heavily medicated by his previous owner and managed to win; however, he died immediately after due to the strain. The fathier was named for flatcakes, a type of food.\nTime for Flatcakes first appeared in the short story \"The Ride,\" which was written by John Jackson Miller and released as part of the Canto Bight anthology released on December 5, 2017.",
