 "content": "K'krohl was a male Whiphid recruiter or \"talent scout\" living during the Galactic War. His preferred weapon of choice was the BTZ-47 heavy assault cannon, which he called Bitsy. K'krohl specialized in recruiting criminals for the mercenary forces, such as the Territorial Enforcers, the InterStellar Regulators and the Saboteur Squads. In 3631 BBY he was hired by Lana Beniko to hire individuals willing to fights for the Alliance against the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. K'krohl was recruiting escaping convicts from the Belsavis prison, but encountered interference from the Belsavis Star Fortress. The Alliance Commander arrived to take out the Star Fortress shield bunker and K'krohl offered his assistance, providing his recruits, still in need of supplies. He assisted the commander in assaulting and destroying the shield bunker. Then, he traveled to Odessen, where he formally joined the Alliance after the Star Fortress was destroyed.\nK'krohl appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as a new companion for all classes, recruited through the Star Fortress series of missions.",
