 "content": "Ryoo Finn was a male Arcona who lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nFinn got addicted to salt, a substance that is addictive and potentially deadly to members of his species. To combat his addiction, he was brought to the Arcona Compound in the Etyyy region on the jungle world Kashyyyk, a camp for salt addicts. He arrived at the camp in 1 ABY and had trouble adjusting to the place.\nIt turned out that he had brought a secret stash of salt with him but lost it near the mouf dens in the jungle. Some of the moufs came after Finn and he dropped his salt when he ran away. In the following days, he became increasingly agitated due to the lust for salt. Johnson Smith noticed his behaviour and asked an adventurer to find out what bothered Finn, as Finn wouldn't have told him or Jerrol Chupapa - the Arcona running the camp. Finn told the adventurer about his lost stash and the adventurer agreed to search for it in the jungles. The adventurer eventually found it and brought it to Smith who promised to help Finn with his addiction.\nRyoo Finn was a Non-Player Character  in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Johnson Smith asked the player to talk to Finn. Then, the player had to find Finn's bag of salt, which was lying in the jungle nearby.",
