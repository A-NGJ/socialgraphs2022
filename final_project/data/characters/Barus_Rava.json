 "content": "Barus Rava was a Human male who served as an admiral in the Republic Navy of the Galactic Republic. Around 3626 BBY, Rava led a fleet to assist the Republic efforts during the Invasion of Manaan against the Sith Empire.\nRava was born into a military family and was granted a proper education and training to prepare him for his long career. In his platoon's first deployment, he and his unit were captured by the forces of the Sith Empire due to an error of Republic intel.\nDuring the 14 months of his imprisonment, he was left scarred and his optimistic view for negotiating with the Republic's opponents was shattered. Since his release, he sought to eradicate the Empire's presence from the galaxy, which drove him into conflict with other Republic leaders. His controversial ways made him unpopular within the Republic ranks, but he was greatly sought after when decisive action was required.",
