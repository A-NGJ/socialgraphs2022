 "content": "A human female individual lived in the galaxy. At some point she had a child named Maree with Skarhorn, a general within the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, she was present with Maree on the planet Garel at an Imperial Complex where Skarhorn marked the opening of a munitions factory with a speech. During the speech, the female praised the general's words and stated to Maree that she must be proud of her father. As Skarhorn continued his speech, an assassin who had hijacked an All Terrain Scout Transport aimed its weapons at the general and declared he would pay for his crimes against innocents. The Imperial Beilert Valance attempted to stop the assassination attempt with a speeder bike and after his speeder toppled the walker, Maree fell off a platform. Maree's mother shouted to Maree as she fell, though she was saved by Valance.",
