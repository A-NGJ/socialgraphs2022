 "content": "Baron Reeol was a male Toydarian of the Reeol line who ruled and owned the city of Riar on Toydaria. Reeol controlled the royal Riar government and its services, security, and major business dealings. All changes to property ownership had to be approved by him, and maintained the royal right of repurchasing the property of others.\nHe was regarded as a gregarious noble, and was described as shrewd and fair. He was able to skillfully avoid allying himself with any of the Hutt Clan kajidics, but he did not ignore the Hutt criminals either, and it was not rare to hear that he deployed the Riar Royal Guard at the personal request of influential Hutts.",
