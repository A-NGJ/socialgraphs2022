 "content": "Agnuk was a Trandoshan male bounty hunter who was member of the Bounty Hunter's Guild. He was a student of the Orsis Academy when he was young. Later he joined the Bounty Hunter's Guild as a bounty hunter. At some pint during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, he was travelled with his son Cradossk to the planet Longwind. There he found Kindro Nimmel who was a Jedi. Agnuk attacked him and broke the Jedi's arm, though Nimmel ultimately succeeded at killing his assailant. Moments later, Cradossk stumbled across his father's corpse and in a rage, he sprang on Nimmel and broke his legs, then sank his teeth into the Jedi's neck and murdered him. Cradossk later wrote about his encounter with Nimmel in his autobiography Making a Killing.",
