 "content": "Nilko Bwaas was a male Selkath who lived during the Jedi Civil War. He was a member of Manaan's government, and hired Revan to investigate why the Republic Embassy was hiring so many mercenaries. He offered Revan five hundred credits in recovering any vital information for him. After Revan discovered that the Republic had an illegal underwater station on Hrakert Rift, Nilko promised to hide the information from the Selkath authorities because of his pro-Republic views.",
