 "content": "Joram was a male Human Mandalorian hired by Marvid and Craitheus Qreph to serve as security in their asteroid crusher Ormni. Along with his sister Jhan, they were stationed near a turbolift when Jedi Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo burst into the room and took them captive. Trying to avoid capture from the ship's security detail, the Jedi pair incapacitated Joram and Jhan with hypo's filled with anesthesia and then took their Mandalorian armor for disguise. Before Joram was rendered unconscious, he warned the Jedi that they'll be seeking revenge for having their armor stolen.",
