 "content": "Jeepfal Nareedo was a male Rodian pilot who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Vana Sage tasked a spacer with checking his cargo permits. However, when it turned out that the permits were not in order, Nareedo attacked the spacer, only to be subsequently killed.\nJeepfal Nareedo was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Jeepfal Nareedo spawned under the generic \"thug_rodian_male\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible male Rodian depictions. While the quest dialogue confirmed Nareedo to be a male Rodian, it did not mention his physical characteristics. Therefore, it cannot be definitively determined which of the two depictions is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, this article assumes that because both depictions had the same eye and skin color, that those characteristics are canon in the Legends continuity.",
