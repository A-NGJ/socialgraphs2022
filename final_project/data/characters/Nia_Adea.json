 "content": "Nia Adea was a Human female who worked in the Thirsty Bantha, a cantina located on the planet Tatooine. She was a traveler and an adventurer who rarely stayed on a planet for more than a few days.\nAt one point in her travels Nia visited the Thirsty Bantha, a Mos Entha cantina owned and operated by her old Besalisk friend Robb. When she arrived she witnessed Robb being threatened and physically assaulted by the Devaronian loan shark Varak'Cha, who gave Robb fifteen days to get back the credits he borrowed to keep the cantina in business. Nia offered to help him raise the money needed.\nThe friends implemented a division of labor: Robb would prepare the drinks, while Adea waited the tables. Additionally, Adea entrusted Robb with her recipe for flavor syrup, intended to make beverages taste better. Eventually, Adea's assistance turned things around financially for Thirsty Bantha and Robb was able to pay off his debts. With the cantina back on its feet, Adea left to pursue other interests.",
