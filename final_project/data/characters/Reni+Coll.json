 "content": "Reni Coll was a female Klatooinian freedom fighter and leader of the Freedom Advocacy Movement. In 44 ABY, she took part in negotiations with the Galactic Alliance that addressed the previous slave revolts on Klatooine. She was also a political rivalry with Padnel Ovin, who took advantage of Han Solo and made plans against him. Since an agreement between the resistance fighters and the Alliance was reached, Coll greeted the Raharra Lapti during a Jedi delegation on Klatooine.",
