 "content": "Bodo Linx was a Nuxan male who worked as an informant. The Galactic Empire killed his family, setting him against them. He met with Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Sana Starros on Barnahof, giving Organa the details for a contact of his on Brentaal IV.\nDuring the Imperial Era, Linx's entire family were killed by the Galactic Empire, leading him to oppose the regime. He found work as an informant, giving information to others in exchange for credits.\nIn a cantina on Barnahof, Linx met with Rebel Alliance heroes Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, who were being secretly transported by Sana Starros after the Empire drove them from their base at the Mako-Ta Space Docks. Linx possessed a datacard that contained details of Qensog, a contact on Brentaal IV who he believed could help reunite the fragmented Rebellion. While they were discussing the deal, stormtroopers entered the cantina, and the rebel fugitives hid underneath the table.\nThe stormtroopers demanded to see both Starros' and Linx's identification, which they provided. After the stormtroopers showed them holograms of the rebel leaders that were currently hiding beneath them, Starros denied seeing any of them. When the stormtroopers inquired about the table's large size for two people to sit at, Starros claimed that it was because of the Nuxan's natural smell, which Linx agreed with. The stormtroopers turned to leave, and the rebels emerged from under the table. Linx handed the datacard containing his contact's details to Organa, who thanked him. Starros and the rebels left, and Linx wished them luck, telling them to be careful. The rebels eventually met Qensog on Brentaal, and the Herglic provided them with coordinates that led them to the Home One in the Kaliida Nebula.\nLinx claimed that he had no morals, calling himself a \"monster\". Despite this, the deaths of his family at the hands of the Empire made him sympathetic to the Rebellion's cause, and he was willing to assist them. As a reptilian Nuxan, he had green eyes, and green skin with spots of brown.\nBodo Linx first appeared in the 2018 canon comic Star Wars  56, written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Andrea Broccardo.",
