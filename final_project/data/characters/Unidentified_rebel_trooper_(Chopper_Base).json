 "content": "A rebel trooper of Phoenix Cell was at Chopper Base on the planet Atollon in 2 BBY, when he was attacked by Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger. Ezra, under the influence of Dark Side hallucinations brought on by the former Sith Lord Maul, saw the trooper as Maul and attacked him. He was prevented from killing the trooper by the intervention of Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus, who snapped Ezra out of the hallucination. The trooper told Ezra he was out of his mind before running away.\nThis trooper first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels season 3 episode \"Visions and Voices\".",
