 "content": "A human male was the commander of the Sith bandits led by Kouru. Kouru led her bandit gang to attack a village for plunder. The bandits, some of whom spot stormtrooper helmets, round up the villagers in the square. The commander states that this is a direct order and demands to know who is the chief. A child identifies himself as the village chief and tells the bandits they have taken enough. The bandit leader asks if he really is the chief or if his father has run away. The Bandit leader asks the boy how he is going to stop them, telling him that he knows he can. Suddenly, several of the bandits with the commander too, were shot by an unknown sniper.",
