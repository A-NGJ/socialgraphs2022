 "content": "A Kel Dor member of the Koon family was Force-sensitive, serving as a Knight in the Jedi Order. He was an uncle of the Jedi Master Plo Koon and was also related to Koon's niece Sha Koon. In a recording made in the Great Holocron by Plo Koon after an incident where he used Force lightning, the Jedi acknowledged his bloodline's sensitivity to the Force and the Kel Dor reputation for perceiving issues of morality in black and white. Since he assumed responsibility for his own actions, Plo Koon asked the Jedi High Council to disregard his uncle and niece's presence in the Order in their judgement. In 30 BBY, Koon mentioned his uncle as he related the events of the Stark Hyperspace War to the amnesiac Jedi Aayla Secura.\nPlo Koon's uncle was first mentioned in the thirty-ninth issue of the 1998 Star Wars comic-book series. The issue was written by John Ostrander and published by Dark Horse Comics on February 20, 2002.",
