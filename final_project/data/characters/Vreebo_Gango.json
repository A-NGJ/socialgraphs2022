 "content": "Vreebo Gango was a Rodian male who was a member of a band of smugglers that operated on the planet Formos. While Gango was a skilled pilot, adept at flying starships along dangerous hyperspace routes, he was also very shy and he found social interactions with others difficult. At some point during the time of the Galactic Civil War, Gango ventured to the Rii Jenks Cantina on Formos, where he was tasked by his associates with making contact with another smuggler group.",
