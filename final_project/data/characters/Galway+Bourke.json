 "content": "Galway Bourke was a Togruta male member of the Balmorran resistance who fought against the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, he and his wife Mindi joined the Balmorran resistance to battle against the Imperial forces that took power over the planet. However, his wife and children were executed by Imperials when traitors turned them over to the Empire. Fearing that the rest of his family would suffer, he tasked a Republic spacer to recover the names of the traitors before they could betray anyone else and obtain the access codes to the Imperial informant database from Imperial Siege Commanders and Sith Siege Overseers at Camp Ravage in the Gorinth Canyon.",
