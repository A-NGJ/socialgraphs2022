 "content": "Pedna Scotian was a starfighter pilot who flew for the New Republic. A female Chev, she flew with Rogue Squadron during the Zsinj campaign in 8 ABY.\nAccording to Aaron Allston's website, his backstory on Pedna is that she was a Chevin slave rescued by Will Scotian and adopted his name in honor of her rescuer.\nThe Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia lists Pedna Scotian as having the call sign Rogue Two during her service with Rogue Squadron. However, the novel X-Wing: Solo Command identifies Scotian as being Rogue Three.",
