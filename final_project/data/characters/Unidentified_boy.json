 "content": "A red-haired Human boy lived in the city of Theed on the peaceful planet Naboo with his mother. The Trade Federation undertook the Invasion of Naboo in the year 32 BBY. During the opening stages of the invasion, the boy became separated from his mother and was trapped in a kitchen by battle droids.\nThe Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi was in Theed at the time and met the boy's mother. He agreed to find the boy, and subsequently found the boy's hiding place and told the boy to return to his mother. The Jedi led the boy back to his mother.\nThe boy appears in the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game, the 1999 video game adaptation of the Episode I movie. The player, taking the role of Kenobi, may meet this boy during the course of the game's fifth mission. The player can talk to the boy using several dialogue options and can also choose to tell the boy to stay where he is. This article assumes the player completed the side-quest. The game's strategy guide explains how to complete the side-quest. Mary Kay Bergman is listed in the credits as voicing \"Lost Human Boy.\"",
