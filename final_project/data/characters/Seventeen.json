 "content": "Seventeen was a genetically engineered creature created by Passel Argente's modified T-series tactical droid, \"Doctor.\"\nHe was a genetic hybrid of at least three different separate species. He had the head of a blarth, with the tusks of a boma and one eye of a cannok. His front legs were those of a boma while his body and hind legs were that of a cannok. His tail was a boma's that ended in the tip of a blarth's tail.",
