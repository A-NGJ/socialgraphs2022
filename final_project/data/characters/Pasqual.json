 "content": "Pasqual was a male human who served the Galactic Empire as a Commander onboard the Sienar Fleet Systems Orbital Shipyard CC-24. The Imperialis, a pleasure craft belonging to the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, was sent to the shipyard for a refit during Pasqual's time as commander, but while under Pasqual's watch the starship was stolen by a group of criminals lead by the smuggler Lando Calrissian and working for the crime lord Papa Toren. As the criminals escaped on board the craft, the Commander contacted the Imperial capital Coruscant and spoke with Lord Mas Amedda, who warned him there would be dire consequences if the shuttle was not recovered.\nEmperor Palpatine dispatched Commodore Idel, Captain Conro, and Captain Shan to the Castell system to retrieve the Imperialis, with orders to destroy the shipyard for Pasqual's failure to keep the luxury yacht safe. Their Destroyers opened fire on the station, eliminating both it and Pasqual.\nPasqual first appeared in the comic book Lando 1, which was written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Alex Maleev and published in 2015.",
