 "content": "Traggissk Reosss was a male Trandoshan and a member of Winnard Clan.\nTraggissk was a wing-commander for his clan until they attacked an Imperial convoy on the border of the Corporate Sector. The Empire retaliated immediately and decimated Winnard Clan, with the exception of Traggissk and clan leader Cloone.\nCloone told the Empire of Traggissk's existence and admitted that he likely had no knowledge of the convoy's Imperial ties. However, in order to gain justice for the members of Winnard Clan, Cloone placed a bounty on Traggissk's head. When it was discovered that Traggissk may have been working for the Rebel Alliance, the Empire further increased the bounty.",
