 "content": "Zenith was the codename of a Male Balmorran Twi'lek who had made a career out of hurting the reconstituted Sith Empire's presence on the planet.\nZenith had been a part of a resistance cell on Balmorra, until Imperial spies infiltrated the cell, and shut it down. He then traveled Balmorra, recruiting members to carry out their own guerrilla tactics against the Imperials occupying their planet. After years of this, Zenith gained a hatred towards the Empire, especially Darth Lachris the Sith's governor, and became paranoid as well. He hated seeing fellow Balmorran citizens work with the Empire, and would often deny aid to citizens who did so. After all that Zenith had gone through with the Balmorran resistance he felt that he may be able to ensure that Balmorra remains free, once the Empire is no longer occupying the planet.\nZenith would later run in the election for the leader of the opposition to Tai Cordan. He gained the support of Secretary Varram and managed to beat Nalan Fiskin in the elections by releasing incriminating information about him found in the Gray Star's journals and by convincing Balmorran refugees on Alderaan to return home and participating in the elections, gaining the necessary extra votes. However, he performed his duties from the Barsen'thor's Defender-class light corvette.\nYears later in 3626 BBY, following the Zakuulan Conquests, the rise and fall of the Eternal Alliance, the start of the third Galactic War, and the creation of Task Force Nova, Lana Beniko informed the Alliance Commander of a shipment of turbolasers being produced on Balmorra that were to be shipped to a Republic base on Corellia. However, the Empire had found out about the shipment, and intended to ambush it. Beniko suggested that the Alliance contact Zenith, who had been at odds with the Empire for years, and work with him to ensure that the shipment made its way to Corellia undeterred.\nHe is a companion to the Jedi Consular. He resides on Balmorra. In-game, he functions as a ranged DPS, wielding sniper rifles.\nHe is voiced by Troy Baker, who also voiced SIS agent Theron Shan in Shadow of Revan, Knights of the Fallen Empire and Knights of the Eternal Throne.\nIn game update 6.2.1 for Onslaught, Lana Beniko discusses a shipment of turbolasers being produced on Balmorra for a Republic base on Corellia with the player. If the player character is an Imperial, the conversation is slightly different than how it is for Republic players. Instead of Lana suggesting bringing Zenith in to help protect the shipment, she suggests tricking Zenith into believing that the shipment is actually intended for the Empire, thus setting him upon it.",
