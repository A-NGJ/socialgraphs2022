 "content": "Haro Whitesun was the brother of Beru Whitesun Lars and Dama Whitesun Brunk. He was killed on Naboo for supporting the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire.\nHaro Whitesun was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the gender and appearance of Haro changed each time a player performed this quest. However, the quest dialogue indicated that Haro Whitesun was a Human male, given his relationship to Beru Whitesun Lars.",
