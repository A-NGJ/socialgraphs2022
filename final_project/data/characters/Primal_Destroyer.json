 "content": "The Primal Destroyer was a massive terentatek that had been imprisoned in the depths of the Tomb on the planet Belsavis by the Rakata until it was released during the invasion of Belsavis. It made its home in the Ancient Stasis Zone, in a shallow lake that became known as the Waters of the Primal Destroyer, until it was eventually killed.\nThe Primal Destroyer appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as the World Boss on Belsavis. It is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means it was killed.",
