 "content": "A male Gamorrean dancer with green skin performed a classical dance number at the Podracers' hovel on Tatooine, shortly before the Boonta Eve Classic of 32 BBY. Although he was heavily built like most members of his species, the Gamorrean artist was graceful and skilled enough to dance en pointe, full weight resting on the tiptoes of a single foot. He wore the usual leather and fur clothes of his species with metallic epaulets and armbands, but had exchanged the traditional Gamorrean sandals for a pair of dance shoes with pointy tips and ribbons. Fode, the left head of the bicephalic Troig Podrace commentator Fodesinbeed Annodue, once expressed his admiration for the Gamorrean's dancing skills.\nThis unidentified Gamorrean was introduced as a comical background character in Star Wars: Anakin's Speedway, a children's video game released by Lucas Learning in 2000.",
