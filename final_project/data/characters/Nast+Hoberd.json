 "content": "Nast Hoberd was a male Human captain in the Imperial Navy. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, he served as commanding officer of the Port Heavy Blaster Station on the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Steel Talon.\nHe was awarded the Silver Valor medal sometime during his Naval service and it was a personal quirk of his to constantly move its display location in his office so that no one ever saw it in that same place twice. Hobert was married to Linesee Hoberd with whom he had two kids and planned to retire from the Imperial Navy after Tenn Graneet's transfer to the Death Star.",
