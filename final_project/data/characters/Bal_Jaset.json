 "content": "Bal Jaset was a Human male who served as an Imperial Advisor and was the High Lord of House Melantha.\nOriginally, Jaset had served as a Privy Councilor to Emperor Palpatine, though he was generally not considered a member of the Inner Circle. In 7 BBY, Jaset assumed his post as Lord of House Melantha. Because of his close relationship with Imperial Center, he was able to get a great deal of support from the Galactic Empire, and brought Melantha to a position of prominence over House Mecetti.\nIn addition to his support of the Empire, Jaset was also a known womanizer. During his time as High Lord, he sired at least thirty illegitimate children, as well as taken on an uncounted number of mistresses.",
