 "content": "T'licl Zanedi was male Ithorian scientist who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. He was a sympathizer of the Rebel Alliance and provided information about an Imperial scientific project to the Rebellion.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, T'licl Zanedi worked as a scientist for the Galactic Empire in a secret research center disguised as a simple warehouse, in the Riverlands region of the planet Corellia. The Imperial scientists working there intended to develop a new sort of concentrated energy source.\nHowever, in 1 ABY, T'licl Zanedi realized that the compound was unstable and dangerous. Out of concern for the possible environmental impact and long-term dangers of the Empire having such a substance, Zanedi sought out the Rebellion since he felt that he did not possess the means to do anything himself. He therefore contacted the Rebel Alliance. In response, Qual'do Herm, an Alliance officer working in the Rebel base on Corellia, dispatched a group of Rebel operatives to met with T'licl near the warehouse. The Ithorian hoped that they could infiltrate the facility and gave instructions to retrieve the design overview and research notes relating to the compound, as well as a sample. The warehouse was protected by an experienced stormtrooper squad and the operation proved to be a challenge. Finally, the Rebel spacers were successful, with details of the compound eventually being turned over to Qual'do Herm and the rest of the Alliance for further investigation.\nT'licl Zanedi appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. T'licl Zanedi was added to the game with the revamped \"Rebel Theme Park\", released with the \"Chapter 6\" update, on May 22, 2007.",
