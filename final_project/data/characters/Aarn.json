 "content": "Aarn was a male Shamed One living on Coruscant after the Yuuzhan Vong had conquered\nand Vongformed the planet into Yuuzhan'tar. His features bore evidence of Shaming going back several generations, but he did not appear to have any direct defects on him. Like many Shamed Ones, Aarn heard of the Jeedai heresy and took to it.\nWhen Nom Anor heard of him talking about how discontented the Yuuzhan Vong were over the failures of the war, the rebellious nature of the World Brain, and the repression by Supreme Overlord Shimrra, Anor quickly realized that Aarn was preaching another heresyâ€”that of rebellion against Shimrra and the Elite.",
