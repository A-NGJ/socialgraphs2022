 "content": "Scoryn was an outlaw and member of the security contingent onboard the CR90 corvette FarStar.\nAs a young woman, Scoryn and her family were abducted by slavers. Alongside other slaves, she fought her way out of the slaver's palace. Her exploits impressed a crimelord, who offered her a position as head of his palace security force. Unfortunately, a minor mistake offended him, and the crimelord ordered her execution. Leading her security force in a mutiny, she wounded the crimelord and his courtiers, and destroyed a large part of his palace.\nNow with a price on her head, Scoryn fled into the Outer Rim Territories, eventually settling on Kal'Shebbol. She worked as a guard for several merchant warehouses, but was worried that she had no means of transport in case a bounty hunter tracked her down.\nWhen the New Republic liberated Kal'Shebbol, she signed onto the FarStar as a way to keep mobile. Her abilities made her a natural security officer, and Security Officer Gorak Khzam used her to keep order among the close-quartered crew. She was also used in ground-side combat operations and boarding actions.\nOnce considered pretty, age and experience had left Scoryn weathered and rough. Her black hair was streaked with gray, and she often wore it in a tail or in braids.\nA bitter woman, Scoryn rarely smiled, hiding all emotion behind a steely gaze and stoic face. She expected order among the crew, and was loyal to Security Officer Khzam.",
