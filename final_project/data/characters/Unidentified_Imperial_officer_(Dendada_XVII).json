 "content": "A human male officer held the rank of Sergeant Major in the Galactic Empire. The Imperial officer was stationed at the Imperial Internal Affairs Outpost on Dendada XVII, where he oversaw executions. After Lieutenant Magna Tolvan was sentenced to death for receiving three demerits, the officer commanded a squad of stormtroopers for her execution. However, before Tolvan could be executed, she received a delayed promotion from the late Inspector Thanoth and reassignment to the Inspectorate. The officer congratulated Tolvan on the promotion, but still intended to execute herâ€”however, Tolvan informed the officer that the investigative branches of the Empire operated on a four-demerit system. The officer apologetically freed Tolvan, who reprimanded him and gave him his third demerit for his failure.",
