 "content": "Lelo-Vo was a Voss Mystic living on Voss many years before the planet was discovered by the galactic society. He had a vision that required sixteen years of the interpreters debating, during which time Lelo-Vo refused to replace them. The resulting interpretation was true at the end. Lelo-Vo recorded his thought in the Writings of Lelo-Vo that were etched on a pillar erected outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths.",
