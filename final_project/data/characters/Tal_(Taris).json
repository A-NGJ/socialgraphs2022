He participated in the expedition that was assigned to work with Jedi Master Cin Tykan to investigate the desolated swampland populated by rakghouls. However, when most members of the expedition was killed with the exception of Tykan himself and a survey team, who had left before the attack, Laria and Tal were trapped under a large piece of debris before a Jedi Knight arrived. The Jedi levitated Tal back to safety.",
