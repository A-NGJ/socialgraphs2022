 "content": "Ethen Remak was a Human male Commando who served as a Captain in the Mantellian Separatist Movement during the Separatist War against the Ord Mantell Central Authority on the planet Ord Mantell. During the war, he spent time on the island Mannett Point, where he oversaw the excavation of a data holocron by hostages on one of the island's beaches. He wore the standard brown Separatist uniform while on the beach and black and white face paint. He also used a backpack and a blaster rifle. He had black hair and brown eyes.\nIn 3643 BBY, while Remak watched over the excavation site, he was attacked and killed by a individual aligned with the Galactic Republic, who were backing the Central Authority in the war. This allowed his hostages to escape.\nEthen Remak first appeared in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic. In the game he appeared as low level boss on the Republic world of Ord Mantell, but was not involved in any questline. His death was required however, for the completion of the achievement \"Liberator of Ord Mantell\" and so this article assumes players killed him as part of one hundred percent game completion.",
