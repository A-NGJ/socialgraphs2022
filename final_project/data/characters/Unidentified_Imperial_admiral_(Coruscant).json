 "content": "A human female individual served the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era and possessed the military rank of admiral. Following the conclusion of Higher Skies Advocacy Group's Imperial espionage operation that resulted in its shutdown due to Arihnda Pryce's sellout of her group to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and subsequent negotiation with Tarkin to promote Imperial Commander Thrawn and his aide, Ensign Eli Vanto, the admiral served as part of a board of Imperial officers in charge of military promotions.\nThrawn and Vanto's were requested to travel to the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant, where they were met by Grand Moff Tarkin and the promotion board in a large audience room, including the admiral. Once the two had arrived, the admiral began a speech that paid special honor to the two officers and promoted Thrawn to the rank of Commodore and Vanto to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Subsequently, the admiral pinned their new rank insignia plaques on their uniforms and finished her speech, allowing other Imperial Navy officers to conduct their own speeches in honor of the two officers. Vanto's promotion came after years of political sabotage to his career by Tarkin's rival, Moff Ghadi. Additionally, Thrawn was given captaincy of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Chimaera.\nThe admiral first appeared, albeit unnamed, in Timothy Zahn's 2017 novel Thrawn. She was subsequently first pictured in the fourth issue of the comic adaption of the novel, Thrawn 4.",
