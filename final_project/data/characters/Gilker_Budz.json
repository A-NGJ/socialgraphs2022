 "content": "Gilker Budz was a male Human working for CorSec outside Kor Vella on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nHe was investigating an illegal animal poaching outside of Tyrena where the poachers were taking local wildlife for pelts, biomaterial, or sometimes as exotic pets to sell offworld. It had been an ongoing problem and the local populations were falling to dangerous levels by the time that he learned of Snee-Roos, an offworld tourist, who recorded a killing of a gronda. He hired an individual to retrieve the holorecording from the tourist and bring it to him. Though Gilker thought this would stop the poaching, he later located a secret Black Sun base who he thought were in fact responsible for the poaching. He once again hired the previous individual, this time to take out the base.\nGilker Budz appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
