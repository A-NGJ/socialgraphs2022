 "content": "Corinna A'Daasha was a female Human and co-owner of the Glow Dome nightclub, located on the world of Adarlon, along with her twin sister Kandria A'Daasha. She was a Rebel Alliance sympathizer who would allow her nightclub to be used as a safehouse on occasion.\nCorinna and her twin sister Kandria were born into a wealthy family that provided for all their needs. As children they never struggled for anything and although her sister Kandria enjoyed a life of luxury, Corinna became bored and restless by it. Looking for excitement and adventure, Corinna ended up taking some of her wealth and left their household to explore the galaxy. Separation did not suit either sister, and shortly afterwards Kandria joined Corinna on her travels. Kandria convinced Corinna to travel to the pleasure world of Adarlon but Corinna enjoyed her stay and the two sisters decided to try their hands at business.\nThe twins started up the Glow Dome, a nightclub featuring elaborate sound and light displays that became extremely successful. Despite her success, Corinna still felt unfilled by her life until she met a member of the underground group No-Holds-Barred that introduced Corinna to banned holos of the Rebel Alliance and Jedi. Shortly after her introduction to their cause, Corinna became sympathetic to the Rebellion and although she never formally joined, she did allow underground holos to be sold through her nightclub and allowed Rebel operatives to use her business as a safehouse.\nCorinna had a rebellious streak that caused her to both reject her opulent upbringing as well as made her sympathetic to the Rebellion. She was very enterprising and enjoyed playing practical jokes, especially on boorish, obnoxious and mean-spirited people that would frequent her club. Corinna and her sister shared a love for clothes, even though Kandria took more pride in her wardrobe collection, and put more care in it: Corinna, despite enjoying pieces she felt accentuated her features, would often wear a flight jumpsuit. When bartending, she would fool her customers by using an holoprojector to alter her appearance and disguise her true self.\nAlthough she was modestly skilled at ranged combat, Corinna's main strengths was her intelligence and business skills. She was a master negotiator and had a wide vocabulary in a large number of languages.\nMore practical than her sister, Corinna concealed both a hold-out blaster and a vibroknife on her. She also carried around a personal holoplayer and datapad.\nCorinna A'Daasha was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. She was created as a co-owner of one of the bars and a potential contact for Rebel aligned player characters.",
