 "content": "An'bal was a female Human who served the noble House Organa as a Grand Marshal in their military forces during the Alderaan Civil War. She commanded the Organa medical camp in the Juran Mountains, but was slain during an Imperial assault on the camp.\nAn'bal appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an Elite boss on Alderaan in the Organa medical camp. She is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot, and as part of an achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means she was killed.",
