 "content": "Mitth'omo'rossodo, known by the core name Thomoro and the appellation \"the Tragic,\" known as Mitth'omo'ross before she was honored with the Stybla honorific \"odo\", was a Chiss female and the Twelfth Patriarch of the Mitth family, one of the Ruling Families of the Chiss Ascendancy. She was responsible for at least five artworks the Mitth family possessed, including at least three paintings and at least two sculptures. Thomoro had four sons who all perished in a climactic battle three months after she finished a painting of a tidepool. As a result of this, she earned the Stybla honorific \"odo,\" the epithet \"the Tragic\", and the Mitth family became one of the Ruling Families. Thomoro was determined to not let her losses influence her rule, according to Mitth archives. Her last known surviving painting was of a mountain landscape.",
