 "content": "Captain Semmac Nisewarner was a female Bakuran naval officer who served under Admiral Hortel Ossilege. She commanded the Namana-class light cruiser Intruder, the flagship of the Bakuran fleet sent into the Corellian system during the Corellian Crisis. Though the large-scale fleet tactics were under Admiral Ossilege's purview, the tactics and maneuvers of the Intruder remained within the discretion of Captain Semmac. She had the respect of Admiral Ossilege, who often relayed his compliments to her. Semmac was killed when the Intruder was rammed by a heavily armored droid controlled ramship during the Battle of Centerpoint Station.",
