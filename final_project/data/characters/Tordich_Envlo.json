 "content": "Tordich Envlo was a near-human male mechanic who served on board an independent freighter during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 10 BBY, Envlo's crew were doing work on the ice-covered planet Vandor, where he was present in the saloon known as the Lodge when the human outlaws Han Solo and Lando Calrissian first met over a game of sabacc.\nEnvlo hoped that his captain would soon find work on a warmer planet, and in order to cope with the extremely cold temperatures on Vandor, Envlo spent a large sum of money on a dense kod'yok fur jacket that engulfed his entire body. He also wore an emergency vac-suit that covered his face and provided some insulation as well as a pair of hermetically sealed reactor gloves.\nTordich Envlo first appeared in the 2018 Anthology film, Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
