 "content": "Frex Junara was a Human male who was alive during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He served the Empire for years, including after the Battle of Yavin, and eventually became an ace bombardier. Due to his love of destroying things, Junara avoided being promoted out of his position as an ace bombardier.\nA Human male, Frex Junara lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War, a conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He fought for the Empire for years, including during the time after the Battle of Yavin, in which the Rebels destroyed the Empire's Death Star superweapon. At some point during his career, Junara became an ace bombardier. Due to the enjoyment he found in destroying things as an ace bombardier, Junara avoided being promoted to a different position twice over his career.\nFrex Junara had fair skin. He was skilled enough at his job to become an ace bombardier, which he viewed as the perfect job engaging in destructionâ€”an activity that Junara loved. His desire to blow things up was strong enough to cause him to avoid promotions in order to keep his ace bombardier job.\nAs a pilot, Frex Junara wore a gray flight suit that featured an armored chest plate, gloves, and a helmet that covered his eyes while leaving the rest of his face and neck exposed.\nFrex Junara appeared in 2008 as part of Champions of the Force, the first card set for the virtual Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game, created by Sony Online Entertainment to supplement the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, which was shut down on December 15, 2011. Junara was featured on the \"Ace Imperial Bombardier\" card, which was illustrated by artist Sunder Raj Kali Kavandan.",
