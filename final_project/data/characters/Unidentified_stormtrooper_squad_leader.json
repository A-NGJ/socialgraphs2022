 "content": "This stormtrooper was a human male stormtrooper officer of the Imperial Army. He visited Old Jho's Pit Stop with his men in search of a treasonus woman named Ria Clarr. Continuing his investigation, his squad entered Lothal re-settlement camp 43, where he was shot in the back by a hijacked Imperial Troop Transport.\nA human male served as a Stormtrooper Commander of the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps four years before the Battle of Yavin, and was stationed on the Outer Rim planet of Lothal.\nThe stormtrooper led a squad of two men to Old Jho's Pit Stop located on Jhothal in search of a rebel named Ria Clarr. Jho, the owner of the cantina, offered some refreshments when they visited, which the commanding officer refused in anger. He then questioned Jho by showing an holographic image of Clarr. Lando Calrissian, who was watching the conversation alongside Cikatro Vizago, stepped forward instead and gave him a hint about Clarr's whereabouts. Then, the stormtrooper and his men immediately left the cantina without giving thanks to Calrissian.\nAboard an Imperial Troop Transport, his squad came to Tarkintown to continue their investigation of the traitor. At the town he met Calrissian and Vizago once again, and asked in an oppressive manner for Clarr's location with suspicion. Meanwhile, unknown to the trooper, Clarr quietly approached to the transport that the stormtroopers came by while Calrissian was drawing their attention. As the squad leader threatened him, Calrissian said he and Vizago would be worth more alive than dead because they were rebels. In response, the trooper ordered his men to stuncuff them in order to bring them to Agent Kallus, however, a laser blast from the Imperial Troop Transport hijacked by Clarr hit his back, resulting in his death. His two stormtrooper companions were also suppressed by the refugees of the settlement camp, and their defeat awakened a resistant spirit inside Tarkintown.\nThe stormtrooper showed strong discrimination against alien species, and was an irascible soul. When Jho offered his squad some refreshments, he blamed the Ithorian for attempting to poison an officer of the Empire, insulting him as \"leatherneck\".\nThe stormtrooper carried a blaster rifle and wore a stormtrooper armor featuring an orange pauldron, indicating the position of Stormtrooper Commander.\nThe stormtrooper was first introduced without name in Rebel Bluff, a canon short story written by Michael Kogge. The story was published in July 9, 2015 as part of Star Wars Insider 158.",
