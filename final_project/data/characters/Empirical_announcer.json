 "content": "An unnamed officer served in the Imperial Navy prior to the Galactic Civil War. He selected by Darth Vader to be part the crew of the Empirical, a scientific research vessel, around 2 BBY. He was tasked with informing the crew of the ship's status via intercom system.\nAt some point, he enlisted in the Galactic Empire's Navy. He became an officer and was selected by Vader to serve on his secret research vessel, the Empirical.\nWhen Vader's secret apprentice, Galen Marek, was rebuilt aboard the ship following a confrontation with Emperor Palpatine, the vessel was in the Dominus system. Marek managed to escape, killing many stormtroopers and other crew members. When PROXY set the ship on a collision course with the system's sun, the announcer was unable to escape as PROXY also jettisoned all escape pods. The announcer was killed with the rest of the crew when the Empirical plunged into the system star.",
