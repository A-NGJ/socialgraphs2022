 "content": "Mideyean was a male Slitherette that traveled with Bobbajo, a wandering storyteller of Jakku. Once, while trapped by a group of Zygerrian slavers in a building in Reestkii along with the people of the village, Bobbajo spun a fantastic yarn of how Mideyean and other animals that traveled with him brought down the Galactic Empire's Death Star. He spied for Bobbajo when a security droid attacked him and later a stormtrooper found and put him to the garbage masher where he almost ate by Oni. He was rescued by Qyp and Smeep and later they destroyed the main super laser of Death Star.",
