 "content": "A soldier served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Invasion of Ossus in around 3629 BBY. A Human male, the Imperial soldier attended to Darth Malgus during the Sith onslaught on the Galactic Republic's Jedi world of Ossus.\nThe Imperial soldier sported short black hair and fair skin. When receiving orders from or reporting to Malgus, the trooper displayed subordination to his superior, sharply straightening to attention or bowing his head down.\nThe Human wore standard Imperial soldier armor where the color gray was replaced by black, and had neither a helmet nor a backpack. While he was unarmed, the Imperial had a comlink device attached to the left ear.\nThe Imperial soldier appears in the 2018 \"Jedi Under Siege\" update to the Knights of the Eternal Throne digital expansion of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as part of the Imperial storyline.\nSince elements of the Imperial storyline contradicting the Republic storyline are assumed to be non-canon, contradictory information is detailed in the section below. Since the Imperial storyline involves the player being an Empire-allied character, it is also assumed that the player always chooses options that result in maximum dark side points, when available. Since the Republic storyline of Knights of the Eternal Throne is assumed to be canon, Darth Vowrawn is assumed to be the Emperor of the reconstituted Sith Empire in the following.\nDuring the Invasion of Ossus in 3629 BBY, where the Sith joined forces with the Eternal Alliance, Imperial forces were led by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus. As Malgus and the Commander of the Alliance dueled and defeated the Jedi historian Gnost-Dural at the Great Jedi Library, the soldier led four other troopers to the site. After Darth Malgus executed Gnost-Dural, the Imperial soldier was ordered by the Sith Lord to rally other surviving troops outside the library. The soldier snapped to attention and complied, using his comlink on his ear as Malgus and the Commander left with the other four troopers.\nOutside the library ruins, Imperial troops were being rallied by Major Anri when Republic starfighters retaliated, breaching Imperial turbolaser defenses and with bombers targeting the Imperial camp. Seeing that the attack would not overturn the Empire's victory over enemy morale with the killing of Gnost-Dural, Malgus ordered that all forces return to the central Imperial command base on Ossus at once. As forces gathered outside the Jedi ruins retreated, the Imperial soldier ran after the group, eventually reaching the command base.\nHearing news of Gnost-Dural's death, Emperor Vowrawn contacted Darth Malgus through hologram. When Malgus and the Commander entered the Imperial Ossus command base's briefing room, the soldier bowed his head and reported to Malgus that the Emperor was waiting for a holo-communication. While Malgus and the Commander spoke with Vowrawn, the Imperial soldier operated a console by the hologram. He continued to do so after the transmission with Vowrawn terminated, as Malgus gave parting words to the Commander before leaving Ossus per Vowrawn's command.\nWhen the player has defeated Gnost-Dural, the player could chose to spare the Jedi instead of having him killed. If he is spared, Darth Malgus would order the Imperial soldier to take the Jedi away in addition to rallying other surviving troops.",
