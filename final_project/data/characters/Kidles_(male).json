 "content": "Kidles was a male Human who was a sergeant in the Imperial Army of the Sith Empire during the Cold War and Galactic War against the Galactic Republic, when he was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock.\nHe was also present on Section X at Belsavis but during the Dread War, he was stationed in the Dread Executioners camp on the moon Oricon as part of the Dread Executioners.\nDuring the Revanite crisis, he was a member the Yavin Coalition forces.\nSergeant Kidles appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as the Corellia Modification Commendations vendor on Vaiken Spacedock, though he was later relabeled as the Level 52 Modification Vendor. Another vendor in the area was also named Sergeant Kidles, though she was female and was identical to another vendor named Sergeant Jolda. Kidles himself was also duplicated as the Level 60 Modification Vendor. In order to rectify the duplicates, the original Kidles was replaced with a new vendor named Sergeant Kirius, who was also identical to female Kidles and Jolda. during the removal of the planetary Equipment Commendation Vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015. Sergeant Kidles also appears as Level 60 Modification Vendor on Section X and Yavin 4.",
