 "content": "Lalat'k was an Administrator General of the Gree Enclave during the Galactic War. He contacted the reconstituted Sith Empire for help in dealing with a situation on Asation, a Gree world devoted to the storage of Gree technology. One such device, a Grand Hypergate, was capable of creating a rift in hyperspace between two locations, linking them instantaneously. Unfortunately, the device powered up seemingly of its own accord , prompting the Gree to seek assistance among both the Republic and the Empire. Lalat'k met with Colonel Jadick of the Imperial Reclamation Service aboard the Harrower-class dreadnought Ziost Shadow and explained to him the gravity of the situation. The Colonel proved reasonable and recruited an adequate help to deploy to Asation and neutralize the problem.",
