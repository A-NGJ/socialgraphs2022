 "content": "Calder Brya was a male Human who lived on the planet Coruscant. His disarming, self-deprecating sense of humor made it easy for him to connect with people, even those who might otherwise dismiss him based on his upper-crust status.\nAside from being a rich socialite with a million credits in his account, Brya was also a fit and skilled shockball player, if not much of a fighter. He was also very well-connected with the highest levels of Coruscant society.",
