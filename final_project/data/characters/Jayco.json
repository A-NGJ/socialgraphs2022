 "content": "Jayco was a human male con artist who worked on the Daiyu during the Imperial Era alongside Haja Estree.\nAround 9 BBY, Jayco resided on the planet Daiyu, living a life as a con artist with his partner-in-crime Haja Estree. Estree posed as a Jedi who helped those in need in order to make a living, with Jayco helping to be his eyes and ears to direct potential customers to Estree's hideout. At one point, he directed Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been searching for the recently-kidnapped Leia Organa, to Estree. After Inquisitor Third Sister put a bounty on Kenobi, Jayco alerted Estree that they had unknowingly found a real Jedi, and Estree grabbed his blaster pistol to go and search for Kenobi himself, later encountering him and giving him information to help him escape Daiyu as an attempt to make amends for his petty operation as a con-artist.\nJayco was created for the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi, and was portrayed by Jecobi Swain.",
