 "content": "During the early Imperial Era, a clone trooper served the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper and technician.\nIn 19 BBY, this clone stormtrooper was stationed aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer that was apart of an Imperial fleet sent to Kamino to destroy the planet's cloning facilities. The Venator that the clone was aboard, along with two others, were sent to bombard and destroy Tipoca City, the Kaminoan capital and largest cloning facility. After the city had been destroyed, Admiral Rampart asked the clone for a status report, in which the trooper confirmed that all Kaminoan facilities had collapsed into the ocean. Satisfied, Rampart ordered his ships to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, the trooper was a human male who stood 1.83 meters tall and had black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. In the wake of the Great Jedi Purge, this clone, just as the overwhelming majority of other clones, went on to serve the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper.\nThe trooper had a strong sense of duty, but was audibly dispirited when he informed Rampart of the destruction of Kamino's cloning facilities, likely feeling saddened by the loss of the facility where he had been born.\nAs a stormtrooper during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign, this clone wore standard-issue Phase 2 clone trooper armor that was devoid of any markings or color.",
