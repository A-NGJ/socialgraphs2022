 "content": "This individual was an instructor in the Royal Imperial Academy on the planet Coruscant that caught cadets Eli Vanto, Thrawn, Spenc Orbar, and Rosita Turuy in a game of Highland Challenge in one of the restricted metallurgy labs. Since the cadets were allowed in the labs with an instructor or officer, Thrawn was in the unique position of being both a cadet and a Lieutenant due to being in favor with Emperor Palpatine, and so he used his rank to inform the instructor that they were testing alloys, and the instructor allowed them to continue and soon left. After, Thrawn and Vanto were in the corridors when they discussed that the instructor and the other cadets were likely in a conspiracy against Thrawn and Vanto, which was foiled when Thrawn revealed his rank as a Lieutenant. Soon after, Thrawn and Vanto were attacked by the cadets.",
