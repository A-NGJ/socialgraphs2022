 "content": "Shenda Mol was a notorious female Falleen bounty hunter who collected her bounties by sabotaging passenger ships, detonating devices in public areas, or even by releasing a virus on one occasion. As a Falleen, she had ultra-fast reptilian reflexes, and her reputation as a sharpshooter, even among the Falleen, was unparalleled.\nEventually, a strike team, including Jedi Master Dooku and Padawan Qui-Gon Jinn, was assembled and sent to find Mol, and they tracked her to Numidian Prime where she had a stronghold and a handful of followers. After her followers were rounded up, it was left to Jinn and Dooku to bring Mol in. Whilst searching for her hideout, Jinn was captured by Mol and before she could kill him, he was saved by Dooku who struck her with Force lightning.\nShenda Mol appears in a flashback in the 2019 novel Master \u0026 Apprentice, written by Claudia Gray.",
