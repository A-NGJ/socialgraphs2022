 "content": "Corovene Manakor was a male Troglof Bank employee who worked for the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the Albarrio system. He participated in the robbery of the planet Scipio, but only because he promised to raise money to free Najiba. He helped the thieves bypass the security system, but as soon as they got into the treasury, they left him to took the heat. After that, he visited Landonis Balthazar Calrissian and asked to help him and his family to get to the planet Lysatra. Lando organized the transport, but the Imperials occupied a Cloud City. Eventually, Jaxxon T. Tumperakki helped them escape from the planet Bespin.",
