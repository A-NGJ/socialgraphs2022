 "content": "Edrinu Zaya was a female Zabrak sergeant of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War. At some point she became part of the Order of Revan and defected from the Republic, joining with the Revanite forces on Rishi's Sky Ridge Island under command of captain Milenec. However, she became disillusioned with the new cause after realizing that the Revanites' ranks included the Empire's worst butchers. Betraying the Revanites, she asked a Republic agent infiltrating their camp to kill Imperial colonel Raygus Mol, as man responsible for the burning of New Drev'starn.\nSergeant Zaya appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
