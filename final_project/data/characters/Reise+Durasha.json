 "content": "Reise Durasha was a Human male from Lankashiir who served as Commander in the Imperial Army during the Galactic Civil War. He was also the father of Jak and Bern Durasha and the twins Celia and Raine Durasha.\nDurasha was like many Imperials in the belief that women served no place in the Imperial Army or Navy. As such, when his daughter Celia was attending Raithal Academy, he disallowed her from service. He would later inform her of Raine's death.\nLike his sons, he was a graduate of Raithal Academy and often stopped by for guest lectures.",
