 "content": "Crawrit was a male Duros who worked as an armsmaster within the Galactic Republic's secret prison on the planet Belsavis. During the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, Crawrit was stationed in the Prison Command Center of the Minimum Security Section of the prison, where he sold weapons from a stall to various Republic personnel. He wore armor and carried a blaster pistol while at his stall, and did not speak basic to his customers. Crawrit had green skin, no hair, and red eyes.\nArmsmaster Crawrit appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Belsavis. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, he was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors.",
