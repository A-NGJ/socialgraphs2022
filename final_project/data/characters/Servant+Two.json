 "content": "Servant Two was a Sith Pureblood male Sith Lord of the resurgent Sith Empire during the Cold War. He was an Emperor's Hand, the most trusted servants of the Sith Emperor, alongside one of his colleagues, Servant One.\nServant Two worked in concert with Servant One and the new Emperor's Wrath to defeat Darth Baras and was distinguished by Servant One only by always having his head covered in his cloak's hood. Servant Two was exposed to the Emperor, causing him to see the galaxy differently than most, as well as speak in riddles.\nIn 3626 BBY, during a discussion the Commander of the Eternal Alliance and Lord Scourge, the later claimed both Servant Two and Servant One were long dead.\nServant Two possessed telepathy with a range unhampered by distance; when he whispered, all agents of the Hand could hear him.",
