 "content": "Denira was the queen of the planet Velmor some twenty years before the Galactic Civil War. She was the wife of King Lorac and mother to Prince Denid and Prince Anod.\nLorac's platform staunchly opposed the oppression of the Galactic Empire and a mob of citizens loyal to the Empire raided the royal palace at Den Velmor and murdered the king and queen. The regent, Zelor, took control of the throne. The older son, Prince Denid was later forced to flee from Velmor with his consort, Lady Loren. The younger son, Prince Anod, remained behind â€“ a puppet of the Empire, patiently waiting for the day when he was old enough to be crowned rightful ruler of Velmor.",
