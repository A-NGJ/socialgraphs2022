 "content": "Ovan was a human male who was the father of famed smuggler-turned-rebel Han Solo and the grandfather of Ben Solo. He lived on Corellia during Solo's early years, where he worked in the Corellian Engineering Corporation shipyards, building vessels such as YT-1300 light freighters. Solo's father wished he could leave Corellia on such a ship, but was never able to afford to. According to Solo, who recounted his father's story to Landonis Balthazar Calrissian, he was never close with his father. At some point, his father brought him to the freighter factory where he worked. His father pointed out that the ships being built there were his contributions to the galaxy, but that they ultimately did not matter. His father then advised him that Han was not meant to build ships, but rather to fly them. Sometime afterwards when Han was young, his father abandoned him.\nSometime between 8 BBY and 2 BBY, the criminal Corbus Tyra posed as Ovan in order to collect an urn containing the ashes of Krestrel D'Naran for Jabba Desilijic Tiure that Solo had been hired by Jabba to retrieve.\nOvan was first mentioned, albeit indirectly, in the 2015 reference book Ultimate Star Wars. He was first identified in the first issue of the comic miniseries Star Wars: Han Solo \u0026 Chewbacca written by Marc Guggenheim, and published on March 9, 2022. He later made his first appearance, via a flashback, in the second issue of the series, that was published on May 18, 2022. In Star Wars Legends, the character was identified as Jonash Solo.\nThere are inconsistencies regarding the fate of Ovan. Ultimate Star Wars and its 2019 updated edition both state that Han was orphaned at a young age, indirectly indicating that his father died. Mur Lafferty's novelization of Solo: A Star Wars Story later stated that Ovan had abandoned Han.\nSolo's relationship with his father, as part of the backstory of the 2018 Anthology film, Solo: A Star Wars Story, was inspired by that of songwriter-musician Bruce Springsteen with his father Douglas, as writers Jon and Lawrence Kasdan both read Springteen's autobiography Born to Run around the time they were writing the film's script.\nJon stated on Twitter that he believes that Han ran away from his father and that Han's father is still alive somewhere, drinking himself to death, however.",
