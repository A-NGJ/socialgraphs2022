 "content": "Blik was a male Shistavanen who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, it was rumored that Blik gained employment with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and helped program their droid pilots. However, later during the conflict, he took an assignment working for the Believers, who were attempting to release a virus on the planet Caarimon. He flew there in his modified Z-95 Headhunter Ku'Amo, with his droid I4-M9 aboard it as well. He landed it on the planet and assisted a group of Believers, but their plot was eventually thwarted by the Heroes of Cularin.",
