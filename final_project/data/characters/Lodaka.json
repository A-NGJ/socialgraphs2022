 "content": "Lodaka was a female Rodian Jedi Master. An unparalleled master of Form III/Soresu, the third form of lightsaber combat. She was also fascinated by the material properties of the various crystals used in lightsaber construction. Lodaka managed to manipulate crystals on a molecular level by using the Force, which allowed her to enhance their properties. Following her death, Lodaka was laid to rest deep within the local Jedi temple on Lothal, along with one of her finest lightsabers, and her notes and papers were brought to the Jedi Order's headquarters on Coruscant.\nMaster Lodaka had a lightsaber that had a blade that was resistant to the shut-down effect of cortosis, which partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber duelists for millennia. The lightsaber was laid to rest with Master Lodaka following her death, within a chamber of the Lothal Jedi Temple.",
