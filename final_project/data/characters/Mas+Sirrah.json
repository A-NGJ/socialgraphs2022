 "content": "Mas Sirrah was a Corellian Human male who served as a member of the Imperial Inquisitorius.\nMas Sirrah was a Human male who hailed from the Core World planet of Corellia. Having a strong connection to the Force, Sirrah pledged his allegiance to the Inquisitorius, a secret division that was established by Emperor Palpatine and served within the Imperial Intelligence. Sirrah, along with every other Inquisitor that served within the Empire, would be given tasks to hunt down Jedi who managed to survive Order 66.\nIn 18 BBY, a year after the Galactic Empire was established by Palpatine, Mas Sirrah was summoned by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who assigned him and Yral Chael to Probus Tesla. Their main assignment was to capture I-Five and Jedi Knight Jax Pavan, who survived Order 66 and had been living as a private investigator in the Blackpit Slums. He was killed by Kajin Savaros, Pavan's apprentice, when the Force-sensitive prodigy delivered a massive, omni-directional Force push that literally disintegrated Sirrah, reducing him to ash.",
