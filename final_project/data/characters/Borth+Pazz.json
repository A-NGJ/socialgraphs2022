 "content": "Borth Pazz was a citizen of Lorrd as of 40 ABY. Despite lacking Force-sensitivity, he dressed himself in Jedi-style robes and carried a non-functional, pre-Clone Wars lightsaber he'd stolen from a museum. Spurred on by the mysterious Brisha Syo, he demanded that Jacen Solo teach him a single Jedi mind trick or he'd jump from the summit of a building. After over an hour of fruitless negotiation, Jacen tired and allowed him to jump. However, Pazz's suicide attempt failed, with Nelani Dinn and Ben Skywalker managing to slow down Pazz's fall with the Force. Pazz ended the day with a broken ankle, screaming of his betrayal by the Jedi.",
