 "content": "Kessk was a Trandoshan male who worked as a bounty hunter during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, Kessk was captured by the Galactic Republic and imprisoned aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tempestuous while he was transported to the planet Coruscant. During the voyage, the bounty hunter Arlain Zee escaped from his cell and proceeded to free Kessk and several other captured bounty hunters. However, Kessk was soon recaptured by Republic clone troopers while attempting to access the vessel's hangar bay.",
