 "content": "A human male scientist worked with a remnant of the Galactic Empire led by Moff Gideon, operating at a laboratory in the planet Nevarro's Imperial base. When a group of individuals infiltrated the base, the scientist and his associate attempted to purge the laboratory's data drives before the infiltrators interrupted them. The scientist attempted to fend them off but was killed along with his associate.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, the scientist worked with a Galactic Empire remnant led by Moff Gideon. At an Imperial base on the planet Nevarro, he and an associate were involved in Dr. Pershing's biological experiments at a laboratory where blood with high M-count was transfused into individuals, resulting in \"catastrophic failure.\" Around 9 ABY, a group of individuals, led by Nevarro's Magistrate Greef Karga, infiltrated the base to destroy it.\nAs a precaution, the scientist and his associate attempted to purged the data drives at the laboratory. The infiltrators then arrived, and the scientist ordered his associate to destroy the console while he fired at the Karga and his allies with an SE-14r light repeating blaster. The infiltrators returned fire, and the scientist was shot, slumping dead over the console shortly before his associate was also killed. Karga and his accomplices then inspected the experimentation area, and a Mythrol infiltrator pushed aside the scientist's body to inspect the console.\nThe scientist was a human male with light skin and dark, graying hair. When his base was under threat from infiltrators, he and his associate worked to purge all of the information in the laboratory, the scientist urging the associate to destroy the console when the infiltrators found them.\nThe scientist wore the standard white and gray Imperial development project uniform, with a silver buckled belt and a holster carrying an SE-14r light repeating blaster. Below his right shoulder was a symbol also worn by clones in training on the planet Kamino before and during the Clone Wars.\nThe scientist first appeared in \"Chapter 12: The Siege\" of Jon Favreau's Disney+ series The Mandalorian, which was directed by Carl Weathers and released on November 20, 2020. Credited as \"Imperial scientist\" in the subtitles, he was played by an uncredited extra.",
