 "content": "This Human male gantry officer was stationed on the Death Star in Docking Control Room 327, together with Lieutenant Pol Treidum.\nIn 0 BBY, the officer and Treidum were on duty when a Corellian freighter, the Millennium Falcon was captured by Imperial personnel and docked in Docking Bay 327. A Scanning crew was brought in to inspect the freighter and two stormtroopers, TK-421 and TK-422 were assigned to stand guard. As the officer worked as his station, Treidum noticed the troopers were not at their posts and radioed TK-421 to no avail, before looking out of the room's viewport and seeing a trooper, who was actually Luke Skywalker in disguise, walk out of the ship and indicate that he had a bad transmitter. Treidum acknowledged and gave orders to the gantry officer to take over as he headed for the door. However, upon opening it, Treidum was hit in the face and knocked out by a Wookiee, Chewbacca. The officer quickly stood up and reached for his gun, but was shot by Han Solo, who had also disguised himself in stormtrooper armor.\nThe officer's corpse was later noticed by Death Star librarian Atour Riten as he viewed the room through a security camera.\nThe gantry officer appears briefly in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, portrayed by stuntman Malcolm Weaver.",
