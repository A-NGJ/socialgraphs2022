 "content": "Wiorkettle was a Snivvian on Cloud City during Lando Calrissian's administration. He worked for Planet Dreams, Incorporated, a company that terraformed asteroids and inhospitable planets and used them to create habitable atmospheres.\nWiorkettle was Planet Dreams' chief artist, responsible for the aesthetics of the environments they created. He was an equal partner in the company along with the Lutrillian Treva Horme and Ozz the Ugnaught. In approximately 2 ABY, the partners relocated their head offices to Bespin's Cloud City.\nThe three Planet Dreams executives were considering selling private hovering platforms in Bespin's Life Zone when Ozz revealed that someone was embezzling money and terraforming equipment from the company. Ozz vowed to investigate but was interrupted in 3 ABY when the Galactic Empire arrived and took control of the city. The partners decided to download all of their files and evacuate, but while Horme and Wiorkettle followed the plan, Ozz disappeared. The remaining partners moved back to the Oseon asteroid belt after fleeing Bespin.\nWiorkettle was a background character played by actor Cathy Munro in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, but is likely unseen in the film. The character was most prominently seen in behind the scenes images and promotional photos for the film, in every case paired with another background character, Treva Horme. Artwork from a 1980 coloring book based on the film is patterned after one of these promotional photos.\nWiorkettle and Horme did not received names until the second edition of West End Games' 1996 Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back. The names were officially applied to the film characters in the Cloud City Limited set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game in 1997.",
