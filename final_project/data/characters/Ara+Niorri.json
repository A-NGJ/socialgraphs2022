 "content": "Ara Niorri was a female Aqualish slicer who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAra Niorri was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nIn the quest dialogue, Zakarisz Ghent would erroneously state Ara's last name as both Niorri and Miorri. This article assumes that Niorri is the correct last name, as it was the one which appeared when examining Ara.",
