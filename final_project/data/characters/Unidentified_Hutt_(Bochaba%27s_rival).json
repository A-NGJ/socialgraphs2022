 "content": "This Hutt was a rival of fellow Hutt, crime lord Bochaba. Residing on the planet Sleheyron, the Hutt was a male. When the Exchange crime syndicate had Bochaba assassinated he claimed his deceased rival's possessions, including the assassin droid known as HK-47. The Hutt was not aware of HK-47's assassination functions and sold the droid to a Senator who he frequently bribed.\nThis Hutt was mentioned in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, a 2003 video game, during conversation with HK-47.",
