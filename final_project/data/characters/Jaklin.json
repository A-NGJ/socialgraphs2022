 "content": "Jaklin was a female Human teacher who served as a loyal deputy to Chief Rikkard in the village of Torbel on the planet Lanteeb during the Clone Wars, a galactic conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. Around 21 BBY, when the Separatists invaded the planet to test its new super weapon under the leadership of General Lok Durd, Jaklin and Rikkard welcomed Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who were posing as farmers to track down Lok Durd's super weapon. However, when the storm shields failed to stay on, Jaklin, along with many residents were infected by the gases. After recovering from the illness, Jaklin was later killed during the battle of Lanteeb when a Separatist droid army attacked the village.",
