 "content": "Tu'chuk was a male Whiphid Spearmaster who became a mercenary warlord in the galaxy during the Galactic War. He was hired by the Hutt Cartel around the time of the conquest of Makeb to lead the armies gathering on the planet Darvannis. However, Tu'chuk and the other three warlords—Sunder, Vilus Garr, and Horic—were unknowingly hired by the Dread Master Styrak and not the Cartel. The four warlords were slain before Styrak's plans could advance beyond Darvannis.\nTu'chuk appears as one of the Four Warlords, who collectively appear as the sixth and penultimate boss in the \"Scum and Villainy\" Operation. The Operation was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in the 2012 Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, and defeating the Warlords in various difficulty modes rewards players with painting-like trophies of the Warlords for use in the 2014 Digital Expansion Galactic Strongholds.",
