 "content": "Dack, also known as Tymmo, was a male Human candidate for Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.\nHis candidacy was due to a rare occurrence of winning every major blob race on Umgul, though he had actually secretly implanted a chip into the blobs to incite their flight or fight instincts. He cheated to stay away from his wife, the Duchess of Dargul, Mistal; even in that venture he cheated, he used his computer skills to make himself the perfect choice for the Duchess. Though he was caught cheating on Umgul by Lando Calrissian, which was a crime punishable by death on Umgul, he willingly chose to return to the Duchess over death . He along with the Duchess attended the playing of the Cathedral of Winds on Vortex as invited dignitaries .",
