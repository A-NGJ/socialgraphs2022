 "content": "Dobias Cole-Truten was a human who made a meager living on Jedha trapping and selling silichordate worms that other vendors would turn into meals. He required a rebreather due to his chronic respiratory condition, which he got from digging near Jedha's kyber mines. Cole-Truten had a reputation, at least with Baze Malbus, of selling particularly wretched worms. In 0 BBY, Cole-Truten was in Jedha City when it was targeted by the Galactic Empire's Death Star, and was killed in the destruction.\nDobias Cole-Truten was first shown in the reel of promotional footage released for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at Celebration Europe on July 15, 2016. He then went on to appear in the film itself which was released in North America on December 15 later that year. Cole was not named in the film, but received identification in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was released the day after the film.",
