 "content": "Antom Moria was a male Human officer who was living during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Antom Moria resided on board Tansarii Point Station, in the Bright Jewel system. During that time, he was training a young student named Neina to become an officer.\nIn 1 ABY, Antom Moria was very concerned by the escalating conflict between the Car'das controlling Tansarii Point Station and the Rak'qua living in neighboring Station Gamma. The officer thus dispatched his student Neina to Station Gamma in order to discuss with a Rak'qua Fervent, one of their leaders, but the Rak'qua refused to discuss with the young woman and captured her. Two days later, a spacer who was also an officer under training arrived on Tansarii Point Station, along with Han Solo. The spacer agreed with helping Antom and soon departed to Station Gamma to negotiate the release of Antom's missing student. The Rak'qua Fervent was not willing to free his hostage but proposed a test of honor: if the spacer could hunt down and defeat a Rak'qua shaman in a fair fight, the student would be released. Since the spacer succeeded, to the Fervent great surprise, Neina was set free and returned safe to Antom Moria.\nAntom Moria then continued to investigate the reasons of the war between the Car'das and the Rak'qua. He finally obtained evidences from the Bothan spy Lercer Gaia that a local arms dealer was involved in the outbreak of the conflict. The officer thus tasked the spacer to travel again to Station Gamma and present the evidences to the Rak'qua Fervent. Hence, Moria was able to convince both parties that the war was meaningless and managed to prevent escalation of the conflict.\nAfter those events, the spacer left Tansarii Point Station and traveled to Tatooine and Naboo. There, Antom Moria introduced the spacer to the officers Ellis Arrison and Eom Nia who undertook the training of the spacer.\nAntom Moria appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Antom Moria was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial\", introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
