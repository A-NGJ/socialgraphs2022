 "content": "This Rebel officer served at Gamma Base on Hoth in 0 BBY.\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Imperial forces, under the command of Darth Vader, launched Viper probe droids to locate Rebels fleeing Tatooine following the destruction of Anchorhead Base. When he detected a probe droid on Hoth, the officer alerted his commander, who dispatched Rookie One to investigate and destroy it. When Rookie One confirmed the presence of probe droids, the Rebels were forced to evacuate.\nThe Gamma Base commander appeared in the 1993 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Rebel Assault by Vincent Lee. He was voiced by Tony Pope. The game depicts a battle between Imperial and Rebel forces on Hoth, three years prior to the Battle of Hoth shown in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. When producing the cut-scenes for the game, the production staff used footage from the original trilogy, editing in footage of members of the game's production staff over the faces of the movie characters. The scene involving the Gamma Base communications officer was taken from The Empire Strikes Back with associate producer Wayne Cline taking the place of Lieutenant Romas Navander.",
