 "content": "Gub Tengo was a male Sullustan, who lived on the planet Darkknell during the Republic Dark Age.\nDuring the reign of the Sith Lord Chagras, Tengo worked in a bioweapons factory, where his job was to inject poison into spores. However, he eventually lost the use of his legs as a result of a vat collapse. Following the ascent to power on Darkknell of the Sith Daiman, Tengo was given a new job, altering old documents to make them conform with the Daimanite alphabet. By 1032 BBY, Tengo was living in an apartment in the city Xakrea with his granddaughter Tan Tengo, and he hired the Human Kerra Holt to look after Tan.",
