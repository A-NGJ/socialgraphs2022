 "content": "Egan Garrud was a Human male member of the Corellian Security Force who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nEgan Garrud was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Egan Garrud spawned under the generic \"corsec_captain\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female. Because the quest dialogue identified Garrud as male, this article assumes that the Human male depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. Furthermore, examining the NPC revealed his name to be Egan Garud, without two \"Rs\" in the surname. This article assumes \"Garrud\" to be the correct spelling, as it was consistently used in the quest dialogue.",
