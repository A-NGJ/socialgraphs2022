 "content": "Dawn was a Human female who made her living as an escort on the planet Etti IV during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 3 BBY, she was hired by Emesh Nar, the aide to the Imperial ambassador Blains Vorlin, for her services and waited for him in his chambers at the local Imperial embassy. However, Imperial Intelligence agent Jahan Cross, who was framed by Nar for the murder of the Nautolan informant Dah'lis Stark, put Dawn in the chamber's closet without harming her.\nCross confronted Nar in order to take the assistant's illegally obtained credits and killed Nar near the encrypted safe in his room. Dawn departed Nar's quarters per the instructions of the Imperial spy, who was reminded of his deceased sister when he warned her to leave. She was also cautioned to deny seeing Cross to avoid implication or connection with Nar's death. Dawn was light-skinned with brown hair and eyes, and wore pink lingerie.\nDawn was created by John Ostrander, the writer of the Star Wars: Agent of the Empire comic series, for the Agent of the Empire – Iron Eclipse 3 of the Iron Eclipse story arc, which was published on February 8, 2012. She was drawn by Stéphane Créty.",
