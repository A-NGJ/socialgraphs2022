 "content": "A human woman lived in Anchorhead on the desert planet Tatooine during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She was present when members of the Inquisitorius arrived in Anchorhead searching for a Jedi who had eluded them in Mos Eisley. When she stood up to the intimidation of the Third Sister, the woman lost her right hand as punishment.\nDuring the time of the Galactic Empire, this human female lived in Anchorhead, a town on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. She had pale skin with red hair and hazel eyes.\nIn 9 BBY, three members of the Inquisitorius failed to apprehend a Jedi named Nari who was hiding in Mos Eisley. Some time later, two of the Inquisitors known as the Third Sister and Fifth Brother arrived in Anchorhead looking for the Jedi. The Third Sister began threatening to cut off the townsfolk's hands if they refused to cooperate. This woman spoke up, claiming the Empire had no authority in the Outer Rim. Before she had finished her protest, the Third Sister followed through on her threat, igniting her lightsaber and slicing off the woman's right hand.\nThe woman first appeared in \"Part I\" of the Disney+ live action television series Obi Wan Kenobi, directed by Deborah Chow and released on May 26, 2022. She was portrayed by Karen Constantine and credited as \"Local Anchorhead Woman\".",
