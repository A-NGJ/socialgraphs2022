 "content": "Slak Sagar was a male Human serving with the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn the months prior to the Battle of Yavin, he was Zarien Kheev's main henchman on a hijacked research vessel situated on the planet Alderaan.\nWhile there, he was tasked with performing experiments on a new drug, using captured research scientists as the subjects. The drug was meant to increase workers performance on Mustafar, where the Empire was using workers to mine mirkanite, a material used in the construction of turbolasersâ€”and obviously intended for use aboard the Death Star. When Rianna Saren, a mercenary hired by the Rebel Alliance, infiltrated the research ship and destroyed the drug, Sagar ordered his men to shut down the operation and promised Zarien Kheev to find the intruders. He battled Rianna Saren on a landing platform and was killed by her. Before she left, Rianna stole his heavy blaster pistol to use as her own.\nSagar also possessed a torture droid, which defended him during his fight with Saren.",
