 "content": "Partagaz was a human male who served the Galactic Empire's Imperial Security Bureau as a major. He led the ISB board of Security Bureau personnel on the Imperial capital planet Coruscant's ISB Central Office in 5 BBY. Partagaz questioned several of those present on their reports, requesting more information from ISB Supervisors Grandi and Lagret before defining the ISB as the organization that treated the Empire's disorder. Lonni Jung explained why protection requests for traffic to the Abrion sector to Partagaz under the major's directive and lieutenant and supervisor Blevin shared information on the Ferrix incident. Shortly after, Partagaz mediated a conflict between Blevin and lieutenant Dedra Meero, who requested the raw data of the Ferrix incident. Along with the latter, Partagaz coordinated the ISB in its efforts to identify the \"Axis\" of the rebels, who unbeknownst to the Bureau was Luthen Rael.\nThe human male Partagaz was a high-ranking major within the Galactic Empire's Imperial Security Bureau who presided over a meeting of eighteen ISB personnel as the ISB board, which discussed their reports in the ISB Central Office on the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant in 5 BBY. Partagaz and ISB Supervisor Grandi discussed where the budget for the Ryloth sector the latter requested would go, and the supervisor stated that the resources would be use for anti-Imperial activity surveillance, prompting Partagaz to request specifics by the end of the day. The major then questioned Lagret on the development of an conflict on Arvala-Six, receiving an explanation that claimed the supervisor had not yet completed his memorandum of solutions to storage issues with those displaced by the conflict as his staff was waiting an assessment from Arvala's ministerial director.\nShortly after, the major asked those present what was the purpose of the Imperial Security Bureau, receiving an answer from Lieutenant Dedra Meero he deemed incorrect. After defining the Bureau as the organization that treated the \"sickness\" of disorder within the Empire, the major requested more information on the ambush on Ferrix Lieutenant Supervisor Blevin provided information on. Partagaz then asked Lonni Jung to elaborate on requests for additional protection for traffic to the Abrion sector, and the officer explained that the requests were a proactive measure due to an increased quantity of construction shipments going to planet Scarif. After lieutenant supervisor Blevin and Dedra Meero fought for information on the Ferrix incident, Partagaz mediated their conflict, advising Meero to submit her sectors' quarterly report and expressing that he was impressed of her detention numbers from Sev Tok.\nShortly thereafter, Partagaz summoned all supervisors and their assistants within the ISB for an emergency announcement, they would not go home, notify their staff and families, and submit their Star Sector and Planetary Emergency Retaliation plans by midnight. Days after the announcement, the major attended a meeting which was led by ISB Colonel Wullf Yularen, who announced what Emperor Sheev Palpatine had decided to do after a robbery on the planet Aldhani carried out by rebels. Shortly after, Partagaz led another ISB meeting, during which he discussed another one of Jung's reports and moved Ferrix to Supervisor Dedro's ISB sector. Afterward, he advised her to be careful and watch her back.\nPartagaz had gray hair and fair skin.\nThe major wore a white Imperial officer's uniform adorned with silver-colored epaulets on his shoulders, a pair of code cylinders, and a rank insignia plaque of five blue squares.\nPartagaz, who was portrayed by Anton Lesser, was first pictured in the Andor television series' first teaser trailer released during Star Wars Celebration Anaheim 2022 on May 26 of that year. The major later made his first appearance on 2022's September 28 in Andor's fourth episode, directed by Susanna White.",
