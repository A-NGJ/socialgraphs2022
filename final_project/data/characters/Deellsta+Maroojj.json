 "content": "Deellsta Maroojj was a male Twi'lek, who lived on the planet Ryloth during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nMaroojj lived in the settlement of Bashka on Ryloth, where he was employed as a customs official. He eventually became the most prominent and wealthy of Baska's inspectors. During the time of the Clone Wars, the heroes of Cularin landed in Bashka, so Maroojj and five other Twi'leks were sent to inspect their starship.\nMaroojj expected to receive gifts from people and got irritated if the gifts did not meet his discerning standards. He had blue skin and had sharpened teeth. He also wore fashionable robes, that were made from a silk-like cloth.",
