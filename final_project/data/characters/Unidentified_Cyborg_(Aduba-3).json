 "content": "A cyborg was a pilot who perished on Aduba-3 in 0 ABY. He had light skin and black hair, and cybernetics covered the left side of his body. He had a small sack of coins on him when he died. After his death, Pera attempted to bury him in accordance with the Sacred Way in Spacer's Hill, but was unable to do so due to the bigotry against cyborgs. The smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca intervened to rescue Pera. Pera asked them to bury the cyborg themselves. After accepting the job to bury him, the two smugglers traveled through town but faced opposition from the spacers on the planet. With the help of Pera, they fought off the brawlers and were finally able to lay the cyborg to rest in Spacer's Hill.\nThis cyborg appears in the Marvel comic Star Wars  7 The comic was the first original Marvel comic after the six issues which covered Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.",
