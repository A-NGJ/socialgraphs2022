 "content": "Arnothian was a male Human and minor Imperial warlord.\nArnothian was a former Imperial general who owned a small TIE/D Defender production facility, which was taken from him by former Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard after the Bacta War. Due to his relatively weak position in the galaxy, he styled himself as a warlord-in-training. Isard subsequently disposed of Arnothian, stopping his attempt to collect power. She would later put his base to good use in her final bid to regain control of the Galactic Empire.",
