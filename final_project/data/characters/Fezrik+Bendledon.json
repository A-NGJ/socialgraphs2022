 "content": "Fezrik Bendledon was a male Zabrak smuggler who lived in Kachirho on the planet Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War.\nFezrik was a smuggler that dealt under the Galactic Empire's nose and even hired Imperial pilots to work for him on occasion. He worked through several contacts to get the Trandoshan's what they want and as long as the Empire was kept in cheap labor they allowed the illegal activity to slide.",
