 "content": "Bannoc G'noc was a male Bith who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Bannoc G'noc was captured by the Corellian slavers and enslaved in the Corellian Slaver Bunker near Tyrena. During his captivity, he met the Bith woman Narlissa and both became lovers. In 1 ABY, Bannoc finally managed to escape the bunker with a group of slaves led by Kyran Silene. However, Narlissa remained captive. The escaped slaves did not reach Tyrena and established a camp in the wilderness. A spacer recruited by Kyran Silene's wife later arrived at the camp. The spacer planed to infiltrate the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. The spacer also met Bannoc G'noc and agreed to rescue Narlissa while going to the bunker. Unfortunately, Narlissa was executed by the slavers in the meanwhile. Once in the bunker, the spacer reached the detentions cells with the help of a guard who felt deeply guilty for working with the slavers. The spacer eventually found the body of Narlissa and brought her personal diary to Bannoc G'noc.\nBannoc G'noc was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Bannoc G'noc was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
