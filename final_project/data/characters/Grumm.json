 "content": "Grumm was a male Whiphid bounty hunter and a honor-brother of the Rodian Gorro. The two lived in the town of Raider's Cove on Rishi during the Galactic War. Around 3637 BBY Gorro mistook a powerful off-worlder for a pirate gang leader thanks to the machinations of Lana Beniko and foolishly challenged them to a fight, which resulted in his death. Grumm swore revenge and confronted Gorro's killer at the streets of Raider's Cove. However, just like Gorro, he was defeated.\nGrumm's first and only appearance is in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan.\nPlayers can kill Grumm as a dark side option.",
