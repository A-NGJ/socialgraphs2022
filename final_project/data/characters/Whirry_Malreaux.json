 "content": "Viscountess Whirry Malreaux was the mother of the Jedi Padawan Whie Malreaux and his brother. She was one of the last surviving members of the House Malreaux on Vjun. Driven insane by the madness that ravaged the dreary world, caused by her ancestors' experiments on midi-chlorians, she came to believe that she could tell the future by looking at the pattern ordinary objects made when they broke. She apparently took to alcoholism, for when she surrendered her son to the Jedi Order, she was said to be drunk. She afterward regretted letting him go.\nWhen the Separatist leader, Count Dooku of Serenno came to Vjun, he took over Lady Malreaux's mansion, Whirry was reduced to a mere house keeper. She anxiously awaited the return of her son while serving Dooku. She secretly consulted with Fidelis to lead Whie home, but when Dooku found out his housekeeper was contacting the party he was trying to trap and destroy, he ordered Whirry to tell Fidelis to lead them into Asajj Ventress.\nWhen Whirry met her son for the first time in years, all she saw was a stranger. Unable to cope with the \"loss\" of her baby, she left him to return to the Jedi Order and possibly committed suicide.\nShe was often followed by her pet, the Vjun fox she had named Miss Vix.\nYoda: Dark Rendezvous heavily implies that Whirry dies soon after her encounter with Whie.",
