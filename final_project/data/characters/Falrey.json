 "content": "Falrey was a male Human officer of the Galactic Empire who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Agent Falrey served a spy under the orders of Captain Thrawn. During that time, the Empire had an arrangement with the Rak'qua, an aggressive tribe of Nautolans living in Station Gamma, a space station above Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system. The Rak'qua had allowed the Empire to set up a communication system in Station Gamma. However, In 1 ABY, the Nautolans had decided to put a lock on the Imperial communication system, preventing the Empire from communicating with its main fleet in the region. Captain Thrawn therefore tasked Falrey to investigate the situation. The Imperial Agent traveled to Tansarii Point Station, a space station neighboring Station Gamma in the Bright Jewel system where he recruited a group of spacers loyal to the Empire. The spacers raided Station Gamma, killing a number of hostile Rak'qua during the attack, and successfully sliced the Station Gamma databank. The spacers then returned safely to Tansarii Point Station and delivered the information to Agent Falrey.\nFalrey appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Falrey was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
