 "content": "Farfer was a male Ithorian who lived in the city of Depatar in 31 BBY. Farfer was a regular at the Grande Game casino.\nFarfer's mate believed that he was gambling too much money, so she bought a permit forbidding him to spend the couple's money. Farfer disagreed, feeling that she had spent more than he would lose. He also continued visiting the Grande Game, even if he could not gamble, in order to watch others doing so.",
