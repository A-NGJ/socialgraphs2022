 "content": "Tresfor was a male Twi'lek doctor who worked at Ja'Boag's facility on Moorjhone during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nIn 20 BBY, Tresfor oversaw the recoveries of Jedi Master Judd and Padawan Dray after their fight with Darth Maul and Savage Opress. Dray had his hands reattached in a bacta tank while Judd's broken arm healed. Upon Judd's questioning of Tresfor regarding the inhabitants of Moorjthone and their livelihood under the rule of Ja'boag, the Twi'lek at first backed away. Upon further investigation by Judd, Tresfor told him to look to the skies for his answer and noted that the Day of Three Suns was drawing near.",
