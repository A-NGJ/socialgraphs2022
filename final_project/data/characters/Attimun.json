 "content": "Attimun was a male Wookiee who served as a general during the Clone Wars in which he became a decorated hero. However Attimun's wife and his two children were all killed during the war which caused the Wookiee to turn against the Galactic Republic in grief and rage. The general attended the Conference on Kashyyyk, which had a security detail including Jedi sent by the Republic, and attempted to kill the speakers with explosives charges. He failed however and was captured by Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nAttimun was a male Wookiee who fought for the Wookiees and their allies the Galactic Republic on his home planet Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars. During this war he help the rank of general and became a highly decorated war hero amongst the Wookiees. However, his wife, son, and daughter were all killed in the conflict.\nEnraged by the death of his family, Attimun became unhappy with the Wookiees alliance with the Republic, which had lead to their involvement in the war. Before the war had ended the general attended an important Conference on Kashyyyk the security of which was run by Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi with Grand Master Yoda also present.\nAttimun planned to attack the speakers at the conference and brought an explosive charge launcher with him, which he dismantled into several parts and wore on his torso. Upon reaching the conference's security check point Obi-Wan greeted him personally and told the Wookiee that there was no need for him to pass through the checkpoint's Holoscanner, however Attimun insisted that all must be treated equally and passed through without setting off the scanner. He then preceded to climb to the treetops above the conference stage and assembled his weapon, taking one last look at a hologram of his family before beginning to fire upon the stage. The explosives passed through the ray shield designed to protect the speakers from blaster fire and started a fire on the stage. Obi-Wan, who was watching the speech, then leapt up to Attimun's location and attacked him. The general managed to hurl one last charge, but Kenobi detonated it harmlessly in midair with a small toy he had earlier confiscated from another Wookiee, Chewbacca. The Jedi and Wookiee then struggled and Kenobi quickly gained the upper hand, subduing Attimun, who was then dragged away by Wookiee guards.\nAttimun had brown hair as was common for Wookiees, and wore an eyepatch over his left eye due to a wound he received which large scar across his face. The death of Attimun's family enraged the Wookiee and caused him great grief. This led to him turning against the Republic, despite his previous loyalty, as he blamed it for his family's deaths.\nAttimun first appeared in the comic Incident on Kashyyyk written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Tanya Roberts and published in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.37 in 2012.",
