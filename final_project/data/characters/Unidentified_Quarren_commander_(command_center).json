 "content": "A Quarren commander was the leader of a group of Quarren stationed at Command Center 12 after the Battle of Mon Calamari. After five of the Quarren Isolation League's underwater outposts were destroyed by Jedi General Kit Fisto, the Quarren commander was informed by one of his subordinates. However, he dismissed the idea that the Mon Calamari were on the move again.\nShortly after, Fisto entered the command center and defeated the forces stationed inside. Fisto briefly questioned the Quarren commander on the identity of their leader. The commander told him that they all received their orders telepathically, referring to the Moappa. As Fisto departed to find the source of the telepathic orders, the Quarren commander stated that Fisto would never find it.",
