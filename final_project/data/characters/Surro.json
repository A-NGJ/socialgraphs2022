 "content": "Surro was a female Jedi Master of the Jedi Order during the Cold War and Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. She led a group of Jedi consisting of Danak, Garault, Landai and Onok that adopted a sixth line to the Jedi Codeâ€”\"There is no contemplation, there is only duty.\"\nIn 3643 BBY the team served as the Galactic Republic's scouts on the planet Balmorra after Grand Marshal Cheketta's defeat at the Balmorran Arms Factory. After Danak failed to return from a scouting mission to the factory, Surro led the team to scout Imperial camps for his location, but they arrived too late and Danak was executed by Imperial Captain Bowenn right in front of them. Surro then led the team to follow a local Imperial sympathizer Ivo, who turned Danak to the Empire in the first place. She questioned him and also persuaded Garault to simply erase his memory instead of killing him in vengeance.\nThe group shared a strong bond that night and when Surro was asked to lead a mission to Ziost by Republic Strategic Information Service agent Theron Shan, Garault, Landai and Onok followed her without hesitation. Unfortunately, after arriving on the planet's surface, the entire team fell under the control of the former Sith Emperor Vitiate, who used them as his puppets, slaying Imperials and innocents alike. Theron Shan and Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko uncovered that Vitiate's mind control over his subjects was broken by electrocution and arranged for Surro and other puppets to be shocked en masse in the city of New Adasta. Vitiate claimed that Surro's body was his favorite so far and engaged Shan's ally in combat, but was defeated and Surro regained control on her body in time to be taken away from Ziost by Shan and Beniko.",
