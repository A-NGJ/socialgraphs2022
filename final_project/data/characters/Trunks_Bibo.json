 "content": "Leader of the Lost Ones street gang, Trunks Bibo was a lanky, tattooed Ortolan who despised everything and everyone; the rich and powerful, the police, and even his own subordinates, taking pleasure only in theft, violence, and torturing new gang members. The Lost One's gartro rookery hazing ritual—devised by Bibo—was infamous in the Coruscanti underworld for its unnecessary cruelty.\nHowever, even monsters could have a change of heart, and in Bibo's case his was stolen by Sleta Suke, the young daughter of the Ortolan ambassador to Coruscant. Conspiring with her to steal her away from her planned engagement, he had the catering for the engagement party poisoned with knockout drops and fled with her into the undercity while the partygoers were incapacitated.",
