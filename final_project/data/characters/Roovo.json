 "content": "Roovo was a Rodian merchant who lived on the planet Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A green skinned Rodian male with the large black eyes characteristic of his species, he was one of many of his species who settled on Taris. Roovo wore light armor for protection from the world's wildlife. He sold weapons from his shop in Olaris, the headquarters of the Republic-sponsored Taris Resettlement Initiative.\nRoovo appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Taris. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Roovo was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors.",
