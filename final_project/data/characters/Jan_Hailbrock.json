 "content": "Jan Hailbrock was an arms dealer who operated in the Tapani sector during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Republic. He supplied a number of nobles on the planet Procopia with illegal weapons and exotic items, and as such they encouraged customs officials on the planet to overlook his activity. Since Hailbrock kept a low profile, most officials were happy to leave him alone. He sympathized with the Alliance during the war and provided Rebel cells in the Tapani sector with weaponry and armor at great personal risk, as if his ties to the Alliance were revealed his career would have quickly been over.\nJan Hailbrock first appeared as a possible ally for Rebel heroes in the campaign guide included in Lords of the Expanse, a 1997 supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games. The supplement was written by Paul Sudlow and Chris Doyle, and did not clarify Hailbrock's species.",
