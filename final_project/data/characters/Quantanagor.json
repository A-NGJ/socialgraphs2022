 "content": "Quantanagor was a male Quarren and the governor of the planet Taypho.\nWhen the Empire realized that Taypho was not of much interest, Quantanagor was named governor of the small colony, which he administrated from the only Imperial outpost of the planet.\nQuantanagor was overthrown during the Great Run, an annual race on Taypho. The Quarren governor participated with some of his men, but was attacked by another crew, consisting of rebel Taïs and Alliance agents. Since the race was often used to settle local conflicts, nobody paid much attention to the attack, and Yele, leader of the local rebellion, announced the creation of a new government.\nQuantanagor was a devious and calculating governor who took advantage of all the ressources of the planet. He didn't hesitate to encourage the Taïs exploitation.",
