 "content": "Armbrus was the son of Sleightan, and the original owner of L7-BO. Armbrus was an honest man who made his living flying people and cargo through the Outer Rim Territories. He was caught by the Empire for apparently hauling engine parts and detained. Sleightan was later informed that Armbrus has been killed attempting to escape.\nArmbrus was used as part of the story that Sleightan told to potential marks as part of a scam routine. As a result, Armbrus might not be a real person.",
