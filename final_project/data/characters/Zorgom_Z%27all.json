 "content": "Zorgom Z'all was a male Rodian who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Zorgom Z'all lived on Corellia with his wife Norith and his daughter Neeka. At some point, Zorgom and his family were captured by Faye Patrick who sold them to the Corellian slavers. The Z'all family was enslaved in the Corellian Slaver Bunker near Tyrena. In 1 ABY, Zorgom and Norith managed to escape the bunker, along with a group of slaves led by Kyran Silene. Unfortunately, they lost their child in the escape and Neeka was catch up. The escaped slaved did not reach Tyrena and established a camp in the wilderness. A spacer recruited by Kyran Silene's wife later arrived at the camp. The spacer planed to infiltrate the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the Corellian Security Force. The spacer also met Zorgom and Norith Z'all and agreed to rescue their daughter while going to the bunker. With the help of the slave Gordo Zek, the spacer was able to find Neeka Z'all and helped her to escape the bunker. The child later returned to her parents.\nZorgom Z'all was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Zorgom Z'all was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
