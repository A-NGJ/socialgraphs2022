 "content": "Raala Ponchar was a female Human spy for the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.\nIn the days following the First Battle of Geonosis, Ponchar sent multiple messages to the Jedi Council on Coruscant regarding several attacks on Tatooine citizens by a new type of battle droid, but the Council lost contact with her soon after. Ponchar was hunted down by the Dark Jedi Saato. She was later imprisoned in Jabba Desilijic Tiure's palace.\nJedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker was dispatched by the Council to Tatooine to find her, but was captured by Saato and placed in Ponchar's cell. Skywalker was able to use the Force to open the cell door, however, and the two escaped together. Ponchar found his lightsaber which had been taken from him after his imprisonment. She told the Padawan that the Separatists had hired Jabba to transport a metal called cortosis for them. Cortosis was resistant to lightsabers, and the Separatists were using it in their new battle droids.\nAfter informing Skywalker that there were other prisoners in the dungeons, the two split up, releasing as many prisoners from the dungeons as they could. Skywalker later reported the information provided to him by Ponchar to his master and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is unknown what became of Ponchar following these events.",
