 "content": "An O'reenian weapons smuggler hired a group of spacers to deliver a cargo of high-tech weaponry to a contact on the planet O'reen in the Unknown Regions, albeit under the ruse that the crates were merely filled with luxury goods and other sundries. During the mission, the spacers discovered the subterfuge and had to negotiate with the O'reenian authorities to avoid arrest or execution.",
