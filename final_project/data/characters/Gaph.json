 "content": "Gaph was a male Ryn refugee from the planet Gyndine. During the Battle of Gyndine he was evacuated along with his fellow Ryn Melisma to the world of Ruan. While searching for Droma, he was approached by two individuals known as Tall and Short, who asked him to forge official documents to get the rich off of Roan in exchange for their own safe passage. Agreeing, they left the planet just as Droma and Han Solo arrived. Gaph eventually wound up stranded on Fondor.",
