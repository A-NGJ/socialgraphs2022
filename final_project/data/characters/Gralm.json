 "content": "Gralm was a human male Imperial officer who held the rank of colonel in the armed forces of the Galactic Empire in the time following the Battle of Endor. He commanded an Imperial munitions depot in the Remitik system, a posting assigned to him by Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine himself, and one that he took very seriously.\nWhen the Overseer arrived at the Remitik depot, heavily damaged following a disastrous encounter with the New Republic's Project Starhawk, Gralm refused Captain Terisa Kerrill's request to be supplied with baradium explosives needed to resume the assault on the Starhawk. Instead, Gralm commandeered control of the Overseer and ordered Titan Squadron to break off pursuit of their quarry in order to defend the munitions depot, which was besieged by rebel guerilla fighters. Kerrill complied with Gralm's orders, but used the ensuing chaos to steal the supplies he had previously denied her.\nGralm was created for the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons, where he is portrayed by Robin Atkin Downes.",
