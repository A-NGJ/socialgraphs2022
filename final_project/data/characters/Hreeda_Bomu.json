 "content": "Hreeda Bomu was a female Rodian soldier. She was a member of the Bomu Clan and occasionally worked for Zonnos the Lesser of the Anjiliac kajidic.\nSome accounts suggest that Hreeda and her relative, Gespo Bomu, were hired to avenge the death of two other Bomus, pirates Heedron and Ormann, who had been killed when trying to stop the rescue of Zonnos's brother Mika. Gespo and Hreeda went to Endregaad and ambushed the rescuers, trying to \"finish the job.\" However, others believe that Heedron and Ormann had not died in the first place and were the ambushers at Endregaad.",
