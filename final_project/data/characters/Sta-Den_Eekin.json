 "content": "Sta-Den Eekin was a Klatooinian male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In 22 BBY, Eekin was part of a 200-Jedi assault team that was sent to the planet Geonosis, where fellow Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was to be executed in the Petranaki Arena after his capture by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In the ensuing battle, the Klatooinian used his powers to cloud the minds of the vast throng assembled in the arena, although it had no effect on the programming of the Confederate battle droids.\nSta-Den Eekin was first mentioned in the 2016 canon reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations, published by Dorling Kindersley. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Eekin was first mentioned in the 2003 reference book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, which was written by Simon Beecroft and Curtis Saxton.\nAlthough Eekin was pictured on the map of the Petranaki arena in Complete Locations, the image of the character was so small that no physical details could be made out.",
