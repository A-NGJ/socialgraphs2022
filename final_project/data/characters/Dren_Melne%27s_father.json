 "content": "The father of Dren Melne was a Human male. He and his wife were the parents of another son after him.\nDren Melne's family held a great deal of contempt to Melne's decision to leave Naboo to become a mercenary and fighter pilot to the point of his father referencing how he came back home years later in a black Flight suit and a Blaster pistol instead of a Hunting rifle.\nAt 33 BBY Dren Melne betrayed Essara Till, who was his lover, when he attempted to collaborate with the Governor of Agamar Challep, to steal N-1 fighters for their technology and was killed by his own contractors. When Essara Till relayed this to the family they were hostile to her inquiries and blamed Ars Veruna's off-world dealings as part of his influence to become a mercenary. He would soon watch with pride when his younger son chased Till down the streets of Naboo. Essara Till believed that Melne's family influenced his decision to betray Naboo.",
