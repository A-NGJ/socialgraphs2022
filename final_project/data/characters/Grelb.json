 "content": "Grelb was the errand boy who served Jemba the Hutt.\nIn 44 BBY, Grelb was stationed on the Monument, where he was employed by Jemba the Hutt. He was accompanying Offworld Mining Corporation workers on a trip to the planet Bandomeer. After the Monument was attacked by Togorian pirates, the ship had to make an emergency landing on an island of an unknown planet with five moons.\nAfter the ship had to be evacuated from a flooding, Grelb was ordered to guard the stolen dactyl. He obeyed the order until he grew suspicious of Qui-Gon Jinn , who struck a different path than the crew. When he ordered the Whiphid thugs to kill the Jedi, they made their encounter with the native draigons, who were drawn . When Jemba's henchmen were devoured by these flying reptiles, Grelb slithered away while the draigons began to attack Qui-Gon Jinn and the rest of the passengers. He feared that his boss would kill him and planned a way to kill the Jedi. Before he could attack Qui-Gon, the Jedi disappeared with the recovered dactyl in the caves. Grelb grew furious and went on to attack Jinn's apprentice; deep inside, he admired Obi-Wan's skill and almost regretted the necessity of killing him. Obi-Wan was able to dodge the stray bolt which ironically killed Jemba, who also trying to make his move to kill the Jedi. Before he could escape, Grelb was attacked and eaten by a draigon.",
