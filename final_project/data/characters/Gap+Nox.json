 "content": "Gap Nox was a male Neimoidian captain in the Neimoidian Gunnery Battalion, who served the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. After the Battle of Moorja, he became a bodyguard of the Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, and in 19 BBY accompanied Gunray to the planet Mustafar, where the Separatist Council had its stronghold.\nNox was stationed to the left side of the bunker entrance where the CIS leadership was waiting when Darth Vader, the newly-appointed pupil of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, arrived. Sidious, a secret ally of the Separatists, however, betrayed them and Vader slaughtered all present, including Nox and Gunray. Nox had orange eyes and green skin. He wore Neimoidian guard armor and was armed with a Neimoidian ceremonial blaster rifle.\nGap Nox first appeared as an unnamed background character in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Nine years later, he received his name in the Star Wars Insider 147 article \"The Devious Neimoidians Revealed\" by Tim Veekhoven, Kevin Beentjes, Sander de Lange, and Leland Chee. The character was specified further in the endnotes for the article included in the Facebook page Star Wars Sourcebooks, which was also run by the first three authors.",
