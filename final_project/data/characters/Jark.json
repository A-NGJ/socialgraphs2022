 "content": "Jark was a male Human CorSec officer who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Jark was a captain of the Corellian Security Force, stationed in Tyrena. Inspector Cora was serving under his orders.\nIn 1 ABY, a ship piloted by CorSec Captain Donovan and carrying a cargo of weapons to the local CorSec force in Tyrena apparently crashed near the city. Captain Jark ordered Cora to investigate the crash. Cora discovered that the criminals known as the Deflarians hijacked Donovan's ship and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft of its cargo. Cora and a spacer finally rescued Captain Donovan from the Deflarian bunker and recovered the ship and its cargo of weapons.\nIn the meanwhile, Captain Jark was interested to find those responsible for the theft of Captain Donovan's ship. Jark discovered that a traitorous CorSec agent named Jori sold to the Ragtag criminals information concerning the cargo of weapons, including Donovan's flight schedule. Lacking firepower to perform themselves the thief, the Ragtags hired the Deflarians to hijack the ship and steal the cargo. Jark thus sent spacers to raid a meeting between Deflarians and Ragtags. Jori was killed during the operation and the CorSec managed to retrieve vital information about Tyrena defense capabilities provided by the traitor to the Ragtags.\nJark appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jark was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
