 "content": "Rendra Maex was a Human female who grew up on the planet Reuss VIII during Imperial rule of the planet. Her father spent his time and money helping the poor and homeless of the planet but Maex wanted just to leave the planet behind. When she was eighteen she bought passage off-world after having a verbal argument with her father. A week later he was arrested and executed by officials for stealing Imperial property. Maex befriended an old pirate who showed her how to handle a blaster and she proved to be a natural at it. She killed her first person for credits at the age of twenty.\nShe made money working as a cheap assassin and mercenary and eventually saved up to buy her own ship, the Zoda. She also took on a partner, the Kerestian Nopul Etrefa.",
