 "content": "Jaith Omir was a human male pilot who flew in the New Republic's Hail Squadron during the Galactic Civil War. In 5 ABY, he flew a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber under the callsign Hail Three. During a battle with the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing over the planet Chadawa, his squadron was tasked with destroying two enemy Raider-class corvettes. However, as the Y-wing squadron flew under the cover of radiation, Omir's starfighter was detonated and destroyed by the particle effect.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Jaith Omir served as a pilot in the New Republic. By 5 ABY, he flew as part of Hail Squadron, a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber squadron serving in a battle group led by General Hera Syndulla, under the callsign Hail Three. The pilot kept a stash of contraband aboard Syndulla's refitted Star Destroyer, the Deliverance. That year, Syndulla's battle group, including Hail Squadron, pursued the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing through a number of systems, following a series of communications signal bursts from the 204th's flagship, the bulk freighter Yadeez. Both parties reached the ancient manmade ocean planet Chadawa, where the 204th became enclosed under the world's cage of mechanical planetary rings with the local navy. Hail Squadron participated in skirmishes with the 204th when the radiation particle tides produced by the rings had openings.\nWith the 204th attempting to sabotage the rings to devastate Chadawa, Hail Squadron, Omir included, were tasked with eliminating the starships carrying out the sabotages, two Raider-class corvettes. Using an opening in the particle tides, the squadron, led by the Nath Tensent, a Y-wing pilot from the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron, passed inside the cage around Chadawa and flew along the edge of it to hide from the 204th's sensors. Omir and the other pilots flew at slow speeds to avoid the radiation detonating their Y-wings' engines and did not speak over comm as the only channel available was shared by the enemy.\nHowever, Omir's fighter detonated and destroyed as a result of the particle tides, Tensent's astromech droid T5 predicting that the radiation may have affected the safeties of a proton warhead. After Omir's death, Tensent and Hail Squadron proceeded to attack the Raider-class corvettes, losing all but Tensent himself and four of their pilots to the 204th and the Chadawan navy, which had intervened against the other two factions during the battle. The 204th retreated from Chadawa shortly after, having lost its Raiders. Omir's contraband stash was soon found, making the task of removing it available.\nA human male, Jaith Omir was a pilot who Nath Tensent found irritating at best and incompetent at worst.\nJaith Omir appeared in a starfighter in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, the final installment of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy which was written by Alexander Freed.",
