 "content": "Jaxa Lian was a female smuggler who operated out of Tatooine for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. She was considered one of Hantor Loftus' most reliable operatives. In 0 ABY, Loftus discovered an imminent attempt to arrest her by Imperial forces working for Project Lasercutter. He dispatched a spacer who was able to protect her long enough to get her to safety back at his base of operations in Mos Entha.",
