 "content": "Sinoca Meeku, also known as Sin, was a Rodian female who lived during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Meeku was born into a family with a long history of working in the bounty hunting profession. Though she mastered many skills of their trade, she opted not to pursue the family business and instead she ventured to the planet Coruscant, intent on making a fortune on the property market. Over the next decade, Meeku had several dealings with the Pyke Syndicate criminal organization and she gained any appreciation for how she could further her business aims by working with criminal elements. Meeku was later among a band of Pyke-affiliated operatives who were assigned to track down the rogue Kadas'sa'Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos and after tracing Leeachos' movements through the Coruscant underworld, they confronted him inside an abandoned annex of the NovaCORE kelerium processing plant, in The Works region.",
