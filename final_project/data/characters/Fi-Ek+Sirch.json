 "content": "Fi-Ek Sirch was a Kajain'sa'Nikto Jedi who was a member of the Jedi Order during the Fall of the Republic. Sirch participated in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY as a part of the Jedi assault team deployed to rescue Senator Padm√© Amidala and the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Petranaki Arena. Wielding a blue lightsaber, Sirch assisted in thinning the hordes of battle droids that had entered the arena. As the battle progressed, many Jedi lost their lives. The Jedi were ultimately surrounded and ordered to surrender by former Jedi Master Count Dooku. However, the surviving Jedi were rescued when the Grand Army of the Republic intervened. Sirch had orange skin and wore brown Jedi robes.\nFi-Ek Sirch appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. In Star Wars canon, the character was identified in 2016 by the digital card trading app Star Wars: Card Trader. However, Card Trader does not provide enough information to determine where Sirch was positioned in the battle.\nIn the Star War Legends continuity, Sirch was identified in Star Wars Saga Daily Calendar 2003. Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee also speculated that the character had died in the Battle of Geonosis in a blog post. He was played by an uncredited extra.",
