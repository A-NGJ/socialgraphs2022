 "content": "Femi was a female Rutian Twi'lek who lived during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire in the year 3653 BBY. She served aboard Orbital Security Station Six, a satellite monitoring the traffic in and out of the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant, just prior to an attack by the Sith Empire. Femi was killed, along with her co-worker, in the first blast of the battle after an Imperial Sith Lord named Angral ordered his flagship to fire on the station, starting the conflict.\nServing aboard Orbital Security Station Six over Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic government, Femi, a female Rutian Twi'lek who lived in the year 3653 BBY, worked with a co-worker for Coruscant Security monitoring the traffic to and from the planet. She checked into Coruscant Control, reporting that there was nothing in her vicinity, and shared a brief conversation with the dispatcher, saying that she was going planetside as her rotation aboard the satellite was complete. She then noticed Sith ships in her area and asked the flagship for clearance codes.\nThe Sith Empire and the Republic were meeting at Alderaan to discuss terms for ending the Great Galactic War, a galaxy-wide conflict that had been taking place between them for decades, and the unexpected arrival of their fleet caught Femi off-guard. Rather than transmit a response back to her, Femi and her partner were killed after Angral, a Sith Lord from the Empire and leader of the assault, ordered his ship to fire on the satellite. This began the Sacking of Coruscant, a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement that forced the Republic to abandon long-time allies and give many outlying worlds over to the Sith, putting an end to the Great Galactic War in favor of the Sith Empire.\nFemi was a blue-skinned Twi'lek female with blue eyes. She worked for the Coruscant Security Force in a satellite orbiting the planet, regulating traffic arriving at or leaving the planet. She did not seem to take much pleasure in her job and was relieved when her shift was over so she could go planetside.\nFemi and her co-worker wore a uniform with a black torso, white shoulder pads, and white sleeves. Their pants were also white. The headset that she wore on the job was a gold color.\nFemi was created for the first issue of the opening arc of Star Wars: The Old Republic, Threat of Peace, a webcomic serving as a prequel to Star Wars: The Old Republic, a Massively multiplayer online role-playing game made by BioWare.",
