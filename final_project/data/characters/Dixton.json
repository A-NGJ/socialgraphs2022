 "content": "Lord Dixton was the Imperial Governor-General of the Fakir sector shortly after the Battle of Yavin.\nLord Dixton was the Human male Governor-General of the Fakir sector. Officially, Dixton held the rank of Moff, but preferred the more prestigious title of \"Governor-General.\" He had a mistress, Marska, who was secretly a loyal Imperial spy tasked with keeping Dixton in line. Dixton was traveling aboard the Curich-class shuttle Resurgence with a light TIE/LN starfighter escort when they were attacked by Irregular T-65 X-wing starfighters. To escape, the ship made an emergency jump to hyperspace which deposited the ship several light-years from its destination above Abonshee. Damaged in the escape, with life-support failing and its grav motor compromised, the shuttle ejected a distress buoy and made an emergency landing on Abonshee, just outside of the Godking's castle. Dixton was subsequently captured by Green squad of the Reekeene's Roughnecks, who were on-planet at the time negotiating with the Godking, Trisstan.\nDixton was an arrogant coward, happy to send the soldiers under his command into battle while he hid. He was incompetent and unreasonable, although he was well versed in bureaucratic procedure and other cultures. He dressed in expensive clothing, and wore a poison ring.",
