 "content": "Bana Breemu was a human female politician and member of Galactic Senate during the waning years of the Republic. She was also a member of the Delegation of 2,000—a group of senators who were concerned with the growing influence of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—by the final days of the Clone Wars. Prior to the formation of the Galactic Empire, the delegation presented the Petition of 2,000 to the chancellor.\nBana Breemu was played by Bai Ling in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the last installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Her scenes, however, were deleted from the film's final cut. Ling claimed that it was the result of her posing in the June 2005 issue of Playboy, but director George Lucas insisted that the cuts were made nearly a year prior to her posing for the magazine. Her scenes were later featured in the \"Deleted Scenes\" category on the Revenge of the Sith DVD. On the DVD commentary, Lucas reiterated his claim, saying her scenes were deleted for length.",
