 "content": "Skolin was a Human male sergeant who served in the military of the resurgent Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nDuring a mission on Taris, Skolin and his squad were sent to raid a pirate outpost in the Tularan Marsh. However, the pirates were infected by the rakghoul plague and attacked Skolin's squad. Skolin fended off the rakghouls, but was badly injured during the attack. He asked an Imperial-allied individual to finish his mission and sabotage the power generators outside the outpost in order to wipe out the rakghouls.",
