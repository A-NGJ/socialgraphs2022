 "content": "Mannee Swaano was a young male Rodian. An ambitious and overly-aggressive braggart, he was a sneaky sales executive who would say anything to close a deal. His coworker, Ruku Kooff, was not particularly fond of him. Mannee was an informant for Navik the Red and alerted the Rodian's Protectors that Ruku was a member of a persecuted clan living under a false identity.",
