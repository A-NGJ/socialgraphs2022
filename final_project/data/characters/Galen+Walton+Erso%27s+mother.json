 "content": "The mother of Galen Erso was a female human and the wife of Galen's father. They lived in a poor neighborhood on the planet Grange, where she worked as a preschool teacher. From a young age, Galen demonstrated high intelligence and being the first to recognize her son's genius, she supplied him with whatever he needed to keep his mind busy when credits weren't tight; first providing him a music synthesizer, chemistry set, and later whatever datacrons she could find.\nAt the urging of his mother, Galen wound up in the Futures Program on Brentaal in 40 BBY. During his time in the Program, Galen's mother died of a short illness.",
