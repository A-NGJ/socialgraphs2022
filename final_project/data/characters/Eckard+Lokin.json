 "content": "Eckard Lokin, also known as Fixer Fifteen, was a Human male doctor of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nEckard Lokin was thought to have been born on Dromund Kaas during the pre-war years, at some point studying biochemistry and medicine, and worked as a science and medical adviser to Kaas City military police during this period. He subsequently received a doctorate, and following the breakout of the Great Galactic War, he was present on the Imperial dreadnaught Warhammer and was one of two individuals aboard who evaded capture when Republic soldiers boarded. Lokin was first identified as Fixer Fifteen during Operation: Red Cell, which saw the Republic Strategic Information Service keeping a dossier on his activities.\nLokin was apparently well-acquainted with the former Imperial agent known as Keeper that went on to become the Minister of Intelligence, noting that the Minister had his eternal respect. During the pre-war years he was also a friend and technical adviser to Cipher Twelve whom he had met in the Old Guard before the agent's assassination, and expressed their shared interest in Mirialan cuisine, during a conversation with the agent known as Cipher Nine in the war that followed over a decade after the Treaty of Coruscant.\nHe was known for conducting extensive research on the Rakghoul plague and created a custom variant, unique to his DNA, that allowed him to switch between Human and Rakghoul forms at will, while retaining the same personality and intelligence.\nCipher Nine encountered Lokin on Taris in Nasan Godera's laboratory. While Cipher Nine's mission was to investigate a Jedi called Ki Sazen, Doctor Lokin falsely claimed he was sent by Watcher Four for a clean up operation, and to catalogue the contents of Godera's lab. The two decided to pool resources to complete their missions. Cipher Nine eventually discovered Sazen was searching for Nasan Godera's Ultrawave Transmitter, a device that she hoped to use to control the rakghouls and make them into her own personal army. Since Sazen was also hunting Doctor Ianna Cel, Lokin offered to be captured by Sazen in her stead by posing as Doctor Cel's assistant. Once taken to the Ultrawave Transmitter, he signalled his location to Cipher Nine. After Cipher Nine dealt with Sazen, the agent then discovered a Rakghoul savagely killing some armed Nikto, which soon transformed back into Doctor Lokin who explained that he freed himself to examine Sazen's laboratory. After handing the Ultrawave Transmitter to Cipher Nine, he promised to provide further explanation of his history once they had regrouped at the Imperial Command Center.\nLokin explained that he was studying the Rakghouls for some time and his true goal on Taris was to review Sazen's stolen research. Lokin surmised that the agent was working without official sanction just as he was and considering both had secrets harmful to each other's careers in Imperial Intelligence, both agreed to an alliance that benefited both parties. Lokin moved aboard the agent's ship and worked extensively in its medical bay, though was officially semi-retired. While travelling with the agent, he scavenged data on the Rakghoul plague and conducted experiments on himself to further his research.\nAgents from Project Protean were scouting the safe houses of Doctor Lokin in order to eliminate him. This was because he was conducting his own research on the Rakghoul virus. One of their operatives and two genetically enhanced human agents were killed on such a mission by the safe house's booby traps and died in an explosion. This led to a period of investigation by Lokin who discovered the existence of the project and their involvement in Vector's Joining. Thus, he departed with Hyllus to deal with the matter. Both Lokin and Vector assaulted Project Protean's HQ and \"interviewed\" the woman in charge to gain answers. Lokin discovered why they desired his demise and how his research was used to further Project Protean and Vector had his files deleted and stopped further Killik experiments. In return for sparing their laboratory, Lokin became the new head of Project Protean.\nDuring the Eternal Empire's Conquest, the Agent went missing. Soon afterward, Lokin retired to a small plantation on Alderaan with his tamed rakghouls. Soon he became terminally ill from his rakghoul disease, until he received aid from the Outlander and was recruited into their Alliance, dedicated to bringing an end to the Eternal Throne.\nEckard Lokin serves as a companion for the Imperial Agent class in Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG, and later for all classes as a whole as part of the Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion. He is voiced by Anthony Cochrane.",
