 "content": "The human Elenzia of the Noble Court, an assembly of exiled aristocrats, had a brother who stayed with her in her apartments on Cloud City, a floating city orbiting the Gas giant Bespin. He wandered into the lower levels of the city and became trapped by rogue mining droids. Becoming aware of his predicament, she asked a young smuggler for assistance through an intermediary—Sir Corto Belrake, also of the Noble Court. A payment of crystals was offered if the smuggler could liberate the brother.\nElenzia's brother was mentioned in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, in the description for the \"Elenzia's brother\" 4–star daily opportunity mission offered by the Noble Court faction.",
