 "content": "Volks was a Lieutenant in the Imperial Army that was stationed on Eiattu 6 under the command of Moff Leonia Tavira. Shortly before the liberation of Eiattu, he was sent to find the body of the Rebel X-wing pilot, Nrin Vakil. He was unable to find the Quarren in the swamps around Eiattu's capital city, and the female Moff executed him for his failure. His death served as an example to the others under Tavira's command that failure would not be tolerated.",
