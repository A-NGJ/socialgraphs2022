 "content": "Nan Pakota was a male Morseerian who along with Urshe Torr and another Morseerian worked for the Confederacy of Independent Systems as scientists during the Clone Wars. The three were tasked with overseeing the creation of a biological warfare agent that would affect the clone troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic. Galactic Republic Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic undertook a mission to the planet Merj to capture the scientists and then use them in a prisoner exchange on Vallt. During the mission, Pakota was captured along with Torr, after they were taken to Vallt where they were exchanged for Galen Erso and his family.",
