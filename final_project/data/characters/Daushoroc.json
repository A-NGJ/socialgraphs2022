 "content": "Daushoroc was an Eirrauc. He and another Eirrauc named Tamoss helped each other escape from Imperial slavery, settling other slaves on a safeworld before striking out on their own.\nSometime during the Galactic Civil War, Daushoroc and Tamoss had become dealers in gems and rare artifacts. They went to Tatooine to search for the Athallian Messenger's remains, making a deal with a tribe of Tusken Raiders in order to gain access to the stretch of desert where the ship's remains were said to be hidden.",
