 "content": "A Gamorrean guard was at least once the employee of the month at his job. His award stated that he earned it for tirelessly standing by the throne of his employer, bringing dignity to his uniform even when covered in rotten manta pears, being punctual, helping ladies across the chasm, volunteering often to take the rancor's temperature, offering family members as fertilizer for the castle, keeping his uniform clean, stomach display, expert show of swordsmanship—although, during a Haiku festival— and for accepting the award.\nThis guard was mentioned in Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a book published in 1993. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in the book is non-canonical.",
