 "content": "Simms was a female Chalactan Jedi Master who served as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Chalactan Force-sensitive, Simms was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Embracing her Chalactan heritage, Master Simms had obtained the rank of Adept amongst the Convocation of Adepts as she wore both the Greater and Lesser Mark of Illumination.\nWielding a blue-bladed lightsaber of her own making, Master Simms selected Initiate Noirah Na as her Padawan. Both Master and apprentice were forced into military roles as the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems; Master Simms was appointed as a General while Padawan Na took up the title Commander.\nSurviving three years of war, Master and apprentice were assigned to the campaign on Toola, both joined by Bothan Master Kai Hudorra in the fight. Leading their clone troopers from atop motmots, Simms was successful in repelling the Separatist Army, until her clone troopers betrayed her. Unknown to the Jedi at the time, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was the alter-ego of the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Sidious, under the guise of Palpatine, issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army and they began to follow its directive: execute all Jedi. Directing Master Hudorra to take Padawan Na and flee, Master Simms laid down her life to allow the others to escape execution.",
