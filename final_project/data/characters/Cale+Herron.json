 "content": "Cale Herron was a male Zabrak slicer who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nCale Herron was a slicer who resided in Mos Taike, on the desert planet Tatooine. He also owned an outpost on the remote planet Lok.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Cale Herron was contacted by a long time associate, the biologist Derg Prantis from Mos Eisley Biolab. Prantis had obtained a sample of the dreadful Blackwing virus from an Imperial scientist and performed his own research on the virus in order to create a super soldier drug. However, Prantis was betrayed by his lab assistant, Bera Jeza, who contacted the Hutt Crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure to sell him the drug. Derg Prantis requested some assistance to evacuate a secret laboratory on Lok, near Cale Herron's outpost, and destroy evidence. Herron later started investigating the disappearance of several high profile scientists all around the galaxy.\nIn 1 ABY, Derg Prantis was finally assassinated, as well as his assistant, Bera Jeza, on Tatooine. Because of the ties between Jeza and Jabba the Hutt, his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, hired a spacer to investigate the crime. Cale Herron was then contacted by the spacer who had found on Prantis's corpse a data disk with the scientist's last words and instructions to contact Herron. The spacer encountered the slicer in Mos Taike and both agreed with working together to find the assassin.\nHowever, Bib Fortuna urged the spacer to solve the case. Herron therefore suggested the spacer to blame Lady Valarian, Jabba's rival on Tatooine. The spacer visited Lady Valarian at the Lucky Despot, in Mos Eisley, and accused the criminal of the murder. Indeed, Lady Valarian was not eager to be held responsible for a murder she did not order. Valarian then ordered the assassin Titus Sypknee to get rid of the spacer but he was soon killed by the spacer. The spacer eventually forced Lady Valarian to pay reparations to Jabba the Hutt.\nCale Herron and the spacer later traveled to the slicer's outpost on Lok in order to continue their investigation. Herron tasked the spacer to investigate Derg Prantis' secret laboratory on Lok. The spacer discovered that the lab was brutally attacked and the entire staff was assassinated. The spacer ended up finding a mysterious datapad next to the body of a dead Twi'lek. In the meantime, Cale sliced the satellites around Lok and intercepted a large amount of communication traffic from the planet Dathomir. The spacer therefore traveled to the origin of the transmission on Dathomir. The spacer found that the area was quarantined by Imperial military forces. Nevertheless, the spacer managed to discussed with three scared people, Illrian Nhagy, Tk-216, Tyla Gallamby, from whom the spacer discovered that an accident happened at a secret Imperial Research and Prison Facility, resulting in an outbreak of the Blackwing virus. After the discovery of this frightening situation, Cale Herron eventually contacted the Rebel Alliance to notify what was happening on Dathomir. The spacer was then recruited to work in the Quarantine Zone.\nCale Herron appeared as a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Cale Herron was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13\", released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong\", an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.",
