 "content": "Cyreltov was a Chiss male bounty hunter who operated during the Clone Wars. He worked for the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and the Confederacy of Independent Systems during a battle on the planet Bogoa, tracking the rogue B1-Series battle droid Coppertop. The bounty hunter and Ventress attacked the 212th troopers. Commander Cody threw a thermal detonator, distracting him, and putting him in the path of a chunk of coral. However, Cyreltov caught it and threw it back. The skirmish ended with Coppertop surrendering. The droid then stole Cyreltov's deactivator and shut himself down.\nCyreltov wore a suit of armor equipped with powerful weapons in the gauntlets that vastly increased his strength and a jetpack allowing him to fly.\nSince the Chiss were not widely known outside the Unknown Regions at the time of the Clone Wars, it is unclear how Gunner identified Cyreltov's species.",
