 "content": "Garindan, also called Long-Snoot, was a Kubaz who was considered to be the \"greatest spy in Mos Eisley spaceport.\"\nWith his face hidden beneath his dark hood, goggles and insect-eating snout, few on Tatooine knew his origins. Many believed that he was wildly wealthy, though his vast amounts of credits were only seen when he paid for information. He was seen carrying the Model 434 blaster pistol, popular among bounty hunters and mercenaries.\nGarindan's information was priceless, and his skills went to the highest bidder, whether it be to Jabba the Hutt  or to the Imperials. Garindan was apparently capable of finding out a wide variety of information, as evidenced when he gave the possible whereabouts to Jabba concerning the fabled Yavin Vassilika.\nAround 0 BBY, Garindan visited Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where he observed a shootout between Rff Huff and Purong.\nJust prior to the Battle of Yavin, he was hired by the local Imperial prefect to find two missing droids. Once he discovered them, he followed the droids and their new owner to Docking Bay 94 and called in a squad of Imperial stormtroopers to attack. Despite this, the droids were able to escape, in part due to the help of stormtrooper Davin Felth's betrayal when he shot his commanding officer in the back.\nAfterward, Garindan met with the Ketton spy Derrida and conferred. The meeting was witnessed by Meyser Kayson's son, who reported it to the Rebel Alliance.\nGarindan later was interrogated by the Rebellion to discover the location of his cousin, Udin. He also discovered that Luke Skywalker had sold a landspeeder in Mos Eisley, helping Darth Vader to confirm the origins and identity of the Death Star's destroyer. After the battle of Yavin Garindan went to Hoth. He had heard there where jedi hunters hunting a jedi. Garindan was paid by pirates to find the location of the jedi. Garindan killed the crew of pirates and gave the information to the jedi hunters.\nGarindan's eyes were hidden beneath dark goggles, as they were extremely sensitive to the harsh sunlight of Tatooine. His name translated to \"Blessed One,\" \"Burnt wood,\" \"dust from a windstorm,\" \"ugly,\" and \"toast\" in five different languages.\nGarindan was played by Sadie Eddon in A New Hope. His voice is a processed version of John Wayne's.\nIn Star Wars  2, Garindan is portrayed as Human.\nIn LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, Garindan is referred to simply as \"Imperial Spy\" and is actually a boss in Episode IV chapter three, where you have to \"kill\" him to escape in the Millennium Falcon. He dresses up as a Rebel pilot and infiltrates the award ceremony after the Battle of Yavin, but is quickly discovered and led away.\nAfter the completion of Episode IV chapter three, \"Imperial Spy\" is unlocked for purchase in the Mos Eisley Cantina. However, similar to Chancellor Palpatine, he carries no weapons. When the attack button is pressed, Garindan pulls out a communication device  and speaks into it, similar to his only appearance in A New Hope.",
