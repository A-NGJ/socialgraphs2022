 "content": "Jude Rozess was a female Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic.\nDiscovered to be Force-sensitive at a young age, Jude Rozess was taken to the the Coruscant Jedi Temple where she began training to learn the ways of the Force and the light side. After passing through the Temple academy, Rozess was selected as a Padawan by one of the Order's Jedi Masters. Training one-on-one for nearly a decade and crafting for herself a green-bladed lightsaber, Rozess passed her Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight herself.\nPursuing the path of the Jedi Guardian, Rozess focused her independent studies on becoming a Peacekeeper; specifically working with the Temple Security Force. In 33 BBY, Rozess was stationed at the entrance to the High Council Tower of the Jedi Temple when a group of Yinchorri attacked the Temple. While putting up a valiant defense after having been surprised by the assault, Rozess was overcome by the sheer number of attackers and was slain by a Yinchorri commando. As she lay dying, her murderer gloated that she was his first kill just as she managed to impale him with her weapon, being the first and last time she would take a life.\nRozess was not the only Jedi to die in this raid. Tieren Nie-Tan would join her in becoming one with the Force.",
