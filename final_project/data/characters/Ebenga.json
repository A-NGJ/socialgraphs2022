 "content": "Ebenga was a Arcona male who worked for the Republic Strategic Information Service during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. Around 3643 BBY, Ebenga was sent to track the suspected Imperial spy Alma near Fort Garnik on Ord Mantell. When Alma asked a Republic individual to retrieve a family heirloom necklace from her home in Talloran village, Ebenga was able to intercept the individual and revealed that the spy's heirloom was actually a recording device. After retrieving the device, the individual gave it to Ebenga, and the Arcona was able to pass it to the SIS for decryption and analysis. Ebenga later mentioned the individual in his report to Harson Nild, the Director of the Core Worlds Operations Group.",
