 "content": "Genel was a Duros Jedi youngling who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars and was one of the survivors that escaped Order 66 with K'Kruhk and Chase Piru following the establishment of the Galactic Empire.\nGenel was a Duros member of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan. The clan was stationed at the Jedi chapter house on Bogden 3. They were awaiting transport back to the Coruscant Jedi Temple, which had been delayed due to the battle there. When masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel arrived with their clone troopers, Order 66 was issued. Several of the younglings were killed as Du Mahn defended them. K'Kruhk and Chase Piru Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, the young Jedi was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\nGenel was present when Lumbra and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, Seddwia, jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the Empire.\nThe younglings were freed by K'Kruhk who gave in to un-Jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru, he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber. After the conflict, K'kruhk didn't want to be a constant reminder of what he had done and left the Soaring Hawkbat Clan after dropping them off on another planet.\nGenel was present with Master K'kruhk, Piru, and the rest of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan when then were shot down over Arkinnea. He was placed in a refugee camp and later had dinner prepared by Master Zao. He was present as Zao taught them their daily lesson. Genel, along with the rest of the younglings and Jedi, escaped the refugee camp under the cover of darkness and made their way into the Arkinnean countryside. He and the other younglings scavenged fields, picking Beelpop melons and other vegetables. When K'Kruhk returned with a pack beast to help them in their journey, Genel ran up to greet him. They continued their trip, and Genel took a nap in the back of the repulsorcart with the rest of the children. They reached a hill, and Genel joined in with the rest of the younglings as they raced Piru to the top. When they reached the top, Genel was shocked to discover an open mass grave where the Arkinnea Militia had been dropping refugees to their deaths. He helped comfort Sidirri. He then watched in horror as an ore carrier flew over the valley and dropped another load of refugees to their deaths. When K'Kruhk realized the group had been spotted, he used the Force to toss Genel and the others into the back of the cart. The vehicle reached the bottom of the hill and hit a tree, throwing Genel and the others from it.\nAfter recovering from the crash, Genel and the rest of the younglings followed Zao deeper into the forest. He hid with the group when they heard blaster fire. Genel was present when the Yunu found the group of Jedi. The Arkinnea Militia caught up with the two groups and held them at gunpoint. As the militia opened fire, Zao used to force to raise a boulder out of the ground to give them cover. Genel fled with Piru and the other younglings but returned when the blasterfire subsided. After the battle, Genel and the rest of the clan followed the Yunu deeper into the forest. He greeted K'Kruhk when he caught up with the rest of the group. Genel settled into his new home and continued his training as a Jedi.",
