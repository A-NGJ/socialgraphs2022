 "content": "Deringon Lobacc was a Human male who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nDeringon Lobacc was one of many Humans who lived in the territory of the Black Sun gang, who had seized control of the area after the Sacking of Coruscant. During the Cold War, he was contacted by the Bith detective Dooce Everton, who was investigating who was leading Black Sun on Coruscant.\nEverton convinced Lobacc to become his informant, and Lobacc began to secretly gather information on the gang for the Bith. But when Everton asked for his information, Deringon refused to meet anywhere except for the Silent Sun cantina deep in Black Sun territory. As Everton was known in the area and could not come himself, a traveling hero got Lobacc's information from him and gave it to Everton.\nDeringon Lobacc appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, as the target of the mission \"The Pickup\" on Coruscant. Lobacc is a Human, but is identified as a Duros in the mission log for \"The Pickup.\"",
