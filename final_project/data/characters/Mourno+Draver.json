 "content": "Mourno Draver was a representative of the Corporate Sector Authority on the planet Talus. He was a criminal, doing business with the Hutts and ruthlessly killing those who posed a threat to his operations.\nIn 1 ABY, the Hutts killed one of his employees during a negotiation. In retaliation, Draver hired a spacer to eliminate a Hutt employee. After the job was done, he paid the spacer to destroy a glitterstim operation of the Hutts outside Dearic to make them \"understand the financial costs associated with poor management\".",
