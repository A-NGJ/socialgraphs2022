 "content": "Swyy'm-Ee was a Trogodile gladiator in the Cauldron on Rattatak, where he wielded twin fi'langs against the likes of other combatants such as Flalios. He was later defeated by assassin Asajj Ventress.\nSwyy'm-Ee only appeared in the sixth episode of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated television series. In the episode, his death was depicted twice in a mere few seconds. The first time, he was shown to be crushed by a falling piece of ceiling right after Anchor Blue. Three seconds later, he suffered the exact same fate once again, right after Grunda Dolma.",
