 "content": "Gek was a male Zabrak captain in the Republic Navy during the Cold War, a conflict fought between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was deployed as a merchant selling starship upgrades for military personnel on Carrick Station, a massive space station located in the Galactic Core.\nGek had tan skin, amber-colored eyes, and black hair, as well as facial tattoos, which were usual for his species. The captain wore a black-and-blue Republic Navy jacket with orange-and-silver accents.\nGek first appeared as a starship upgrades vendor for Republic players in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released by BioWare in 2011.",
