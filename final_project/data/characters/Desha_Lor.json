 "content": "Desha Lor was a female Twi'lek who in 43 ABY was appointed by Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala to be the assistant to Daala's assistant, Wynn Dorvan. As Dorvan had said the day before her appointment that the really did not want an assistant, Daala placed a bouquet of flowers in his office with a note:'Sorry, a favor'.\nLor was born into a family friendly with Chief of State Natasi Daala. She was a stellar student with no criminal record. She was thought by Wynn Dorvan to have been selected by Daala because the chief of state felt that Lor, as a female, may not have the chance later in her career, and because she sympathized with her, having been looked down upon during her Imperial career due to her gender.\nDesha was eager and hardworking. She was also very compassionate and saw the best in people. Dorvan would sometimes wonder whether anyone was this innocent anymore. She was also a very caring person, as she was horrified at the carnage wrought by Jedi Knight Natua Wan at the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition when she succumbed to a mysterious ailment.",
