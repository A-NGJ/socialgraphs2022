 "content": "A Human male member of the Rebel Alliance. In 0 ABY, the individual was stationed on Yavin base and questioned the Imperial assassin X-7, who was using the alias of S'ree Bonard, when he landed on Yavin 4.\nDue to the outdated Alliance landing codes that Bonard used, which were taken from the Rebel Lieutenant Jez Planchet under torture, the individual was suspicious of him. Bonard explained to the individual that Planchet recruited him to the Alliance and asked him to report to the base. The individual tested Bonard by remarking that he must have met Planchet on the planet Kashyyyk, and Bonard correctly answered that he met Planchet instead on Malastare, where the lieutenant was on a deep undercover mission.",
