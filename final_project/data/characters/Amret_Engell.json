 "content": "Amret Engell was a human female who served as a general in the armed forces of the First Order and was also a member of First Order High Command. After Captain Phasma was killed during the Battle of Oetchi, Engell took over Phasma's responsibilities and commanded a large portion of General Armitage Hux's stormtrooper training program.\nEngell served on the Supreme Council, a cabinet of high-ranking First Order officers, during the last days of the First Order-Resistance War. As new planets fell under the control of the First Order, Engell saw it as an opportunity to obtain an abundance of children that she could mold into stormtroopers. With the discovery of the Sith Eternal and its Xyston-class Star Destroyer fleet, the Final Order, Engell enthusiastically welcomed the addition of Sith troopers to the First Order's war effort. Engell admired Supreme Leader Kylo Ren for his initiative and unquestioned authority, and strived to create an army that was worthy of his approval.\nEngell was killed during the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY. After the general's death, an uprising against the First Order occurred across the galaxy.\nGeneral Engell was played by Diana Kent in Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.",
