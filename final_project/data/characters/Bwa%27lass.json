 "content": "Bwa'lass was a male Selkath who lived in Ahto City during the time of the Jedi Civil War. Serving as an Arbiter, he was appointed by the Ahto High Court for various cases.\nBwa'lass was appointed to represent Revan as a result of his attack on the Sith Embassy while searching for Manaan's hidden Star Map. Seeing that Bwa'lass was not competent in his questioning, Revan chose to represent himself.\nIf Revan allows Bwa'lass to defend him without interruption, Bwa'lass will desperately turn to an insanity defense when his other strategies failed. The player will be found guilty and be executed.\nIf the player finds the datapad that details the Sith plan to corrupt Manaan's youth and spread the dark side of the Force among those Selkath who are sensitive to the Force, he can present it to Bwa'lass, who is competent enough to realize the value of the evidence. Bwa'lass does not accompany Revan to the trial, so it appears that the player represents themselves.",
