 "content": "Tobin was a male Mosciive soldier and a loyal supporter of the Empress Sephani of his homeworld of Simocadia. During the Clone Wars, the CIS launched an assault on the planet and Tobin was one of the last men standing to defend the Empress in her palace. They were about to be overrun, but were saved by the timely arrival of Jedi Master Mace Windu and his troops. When the Empress revealed that her son, Yojan, had joined the CIS, Mace decided to go and stop him. Tobin and his men, as the loyal supporters of the royal family, tried to delay him to buy the prince some time, but were defeated in the seconds when the Jedi Master Force-pushed them against a wall.",
