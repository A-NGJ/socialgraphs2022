 "content": "Ahk'laht was a male Noghri bodyguard, assigned to protect Leia Organa Solo in her duties as ambassador.\nDuring negotiations between Leia and a Barabel ambassador over access to the Alater-ka spaceport, Ahk'laht feared that in the Barabel's effort to intimidate Lady Vader, he might strike her. He subsequently took action and rendered the ambassador unconscious.\nAlready under pressure from Mon Mothma and other New Republic representatives—including an Elomin representative who called Leia a \"slaver\"—to cut her ties with the Noghri, this incident finally convinced Leia to send the Noghri home. She instructed Ahk'laht to contact the clan dynasts on Honoghr and report that he and his comrades were returning home.",
