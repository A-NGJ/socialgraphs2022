 "content": "Bodwae was a male Laerdocian who worked as a sensor officer on the Errant Venture as of 19 ABY. He spoke with his species' characteristic accent, inserting J's before I's so that, for example, \"ship going to get hit\" became \"shjip gojing to get hjit.\" He continued to serve as sensor officer during the Battle of Yaga Minor, when the ship was briefly under the command of Garm Bel Iblis.",
