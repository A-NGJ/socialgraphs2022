 "content": "A Troig individual served as the auctioneer of an auction on the planet Spira during the Galactic Civil War. During the auction, a Nihil strikeship was put up for sale by the auctioneer, beginning with a twenty-five thousand credits bid from the curator of the Imperial Museum. The Troig confirmed the curator's bid, adding that the strikeship would be a nice addition to the collection at the museum, before asking if anyone was prepared to bid twenty-six. Rebel captain Amilyn Holdo then made a bid for the proposed amount, but the curator immediately countered with a thirty thousand bid. Before the sale could be finalized by the auctioneer, Holdo bidded thirty-five thousand, to which the curator eventually responded with a fifty thousand credit bid. After Lando Calrissian suggested to the rebels that they let the curator win, the Troig completed the sale and wished that it bring great joy to the curator.",
