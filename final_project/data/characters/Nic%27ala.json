 "content": "Captain Nic'ala was a male Twi'lek who served as Commander of the Republic Special Forces Division during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3642 BBY, Captain Nic'ala led his special forces unit on the planet Balmorra to battle the Empire and expressed concern over starship development that the Imperials conducted in the Balmorran Arms Factory. Their efforts to retake Balmorra had become dangerous due to the production of new stealth bombers that had been developed. His subordinate, Private Derrik Reed, had produced several overload modules that would short out the bombers' electrical systems, which they convinced a fellow Republic citizen to deploy and use.",
