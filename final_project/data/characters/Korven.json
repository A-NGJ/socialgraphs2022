 "content": "Korven, codenamed Cipher Fourteen, was a female Human Cipher Agent of Imperial Intelligence living during the Galactic War. During her service for the Sith Empire she earned multiple commendations, but was also reprimanded for using methods too extreme even for the Sith standards. Her reputation as a ruthless, ambitious, and amoral individual eventually backfired when other agents started to refuse working with her for fear of back-stabbing, leading to a stall in her career. It led to her defecting and later being suspected in several anti-Imperial terrorist acts. Following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, Korven re-emerged as a leader of a rogue faction of Sith defectors. Operating from the Vanguard Station, they began targeting and destroying nearby Alliance outposts. This eventually prompted the Alliance to retaliate and in defending the Vanguard Station against the assault, Korven was killed.\nMajor Korven appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during the final boss fight of \"Fractured\" Uprising.",
