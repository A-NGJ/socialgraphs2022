 "content": "Kaveri Ra was a Force-sensitive Togruta female who traveled to Spintir to hone her Force abilities.\nSeparated at an early age from her family, Kaveri Ra had to rely on the wilderness for her survival. She eventually came into contact with the scholar Hethan Romund, who deduced her Force-sensitive nature due to her interaction with fauna and anticipation of danger. She eventually learned the force from her, and eventually met up with the Zabrak monk, Dao Jodh, when traveling to a monastery on the Outer Rim world of Jiran VII.\nAfter Romund was captured by the dark sider Malefax in 0 ABY, Ra joined with other individuals to rescue her.",
