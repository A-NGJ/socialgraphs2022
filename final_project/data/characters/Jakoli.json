 "content": "Jakoli was a male Rodian bounty hunter who was known for never sparing his prey from death. In order to ensure success in the field of bounty hunting, Jakoli felt that it was only necessary to kill his targets. The Rodian's ruthlessness eventually caught the eye of the Sith Lord Count Dooku during the Clone Wars. Dooku invited twelve prolific bounty hunters, including Jakoli, to the planet Serenno, where they were to compete in a series of deadly challenges inside a structure known only as the Box. The prize was a place in a kidnapping operation. Jakoli survived the first two challenges, but during the third challenge, which involved evading electrical ray shields, Jakoli was caught in a shield that rose from the floor of the room. The electrifying experience killed Jakoli, bringing an end to his bloody career.\nJakoli was a male Rodian from the planet Rodia. Growing up in his homeworld's jungles, Jakoli, like other Rodians, fostered dreams of becoming a big-time bounty hunter. However, while many rookie Rodian hunters became a victim to their own prey, Jakoli managed to survive by never taking chances with live bounties, and instead opted to kill his targets. By the time of the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide struggle, Jakoli's violent tactics caught the eyes of the Sith Lord Count Dooku. As the war waged on, Dooku, who headed the Confederacy of Independent Systems, planned to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Needing a team of skilled bounty hunters, Dooku invited Jakoli and eleven other bounty hunters to the planet Serenno. The other bounty hunters included the Duros hunter Cad Bane, the Concord Dawn marksman Rako Hardeen, the Ithorian brothers Bulduga and Onca, the Weequay bounty hunter Kiera Swan, the acrobatic Frenk Twazzi, the Snivvian inventor Sinrich, the Selkath Mantu, the Kyuzo bounty hunter Embo, the Sakiyan Sixtatâ€”better known as the \"Outlands Butcher,\" and the Parwan bounty hunter Derrown.\nTogether, the bounty hunters were to take on five potentially fatal challenges. The survivors' prize was a place on Dooku's kidnapping mission. The challenges were to take place inside a massive structure known only as the Box, which was designed by the Phindian Moralo Eval. In addition, Eval was to preside over all of the challenges, monitoring the bounty hunters from a control room. Shortly before Jakoli and the others were to enter the box, Bane shot Bulduga over the Ithorian's hat, decreasing the number of Jakoli's competitors. Once inside the Box, the first challenge involved the bounty hunters being stranded on a series of tall pillars while the room slowly filled with toxic dioxis gas. Hardeen concluded that the only way to escape the room was to dive into the gas and escape through a tunnel system in the floor. Jakoli and the others complied, and the hunters made it safely to the next room. The second challenge required the bounty hunters to escape into a tunnel located in the second room's ceiling while evading moving blocks that were armed with laser blades. Swan and Onca were both skewered during this challenge, and Sinrich was strangled to death by Embo, while Jakoli and the others made it to the third challenge room.\nThe third challenge required the bounty hunters to evade electrified ray shields. A pedestal in the center of the room contained a serum that would allow someone to reach through a ray shield that guarded a switch that, once activated, would deactivate the remaining ray shields. However, the serum was also toxic to everyone but Derrown, who could naturally resist the toxins in the serum. However, before the Parwan could deactivate the shields, Jakoli was caught in a shield that rose from the floor, which fatally fried the Rodian. Mantu was also killed by the same ray shield before Derrown could flip the switch. Ultimately, the only bounty hunters who survived were Bane, Hardeen, Twazzi, Embo, and Derrown.\nJakoli was a violent, ruthless bounty hunter. However, he found that killing his targets, as opposed to taking them alive, was far safer. As far as Jakoli was concerned, there was no such thing as a dead or alive bounty.\nA male Rodian, Jakoli had pale green skin, blue eyes, and was 1.74 meters tall.\nJakoli owned a blaster pistol.\nJakoli was created for the TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and appeared in the episode \"The Box,\" where he was voiced by series creator Dave Filoni. Jakoli's body model was a modified and repainted version of the model used for the character Greedo, another Rodian who appeared earlier in the episode \"Sphere of Influence.\"",
