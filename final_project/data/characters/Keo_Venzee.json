 "content": "Keo Venzee was a Force-sensitive Mirialan pilot who served as a member of the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Endor, Venzee fought against the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron.\nVenzee was born on the Mirialan homeworld of Mirial. There, they learned to feel the ways of the Force, as was tradition on Mirial. Before Venzee joined the New Republic they were a professional starship racer. In their time racing, they won five medals, including a champion's medal from the Socorro Sunset Grand Prix. Due to their championship wins, they angered criminal syndicates who controlled races in the Outer Rim Territories. They were subsequently saved by someone who opened their eyes to the struggle between the Galactic Empire and the New Republic.\nVenzee flew for the Vanguard Squadron, a starfighter squadron that was vital in the destruction of the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Venzee predominantly flew an A-wing starfighter. The squadron served in the Bormea sector around 5 ABY on a special assignment known as Project Starhawk. Venzee and the other Vanguard Squadron pilots worked under General Hera Syndulla when she brought some forces to assist them. Shortly after, Syndulla received word that her own battle group had been devastated by the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing during its campaign in the Cerberon system.\nHowever, they denied their Force-sensitivity by saying their abilities were just a hunch. Venzee frequently used this ability to make predictions regarding the battles they were in, much to the amazement of their wingmate Feresk Tssat.\nKeo Venzee was a Mirialan with yellow skin, black hair, and blue eyes. They were optimistic and easygoing, often making jokes with their wingmate during even the most stressful of times.\nKeo Venzee was created for the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons. They were voiced by Bex Taylor-Klaus, who also uses \"they/them\" pronouns and is nonbinary. Keo's flight helmet prominently features the colors of the non-binary flag. When pointed out, Electronic Arts Star Wars community director Jay Ingram stated that the design was a \"complete accident.\"",
