 "content": "Tresalis was a Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order before the fall of the Galactic Republic at the end of the Clone Wars.\nTresalis was a Jedi Master trained in the ways of Force healing. As a noted Jedi healer, Tresalis created a holocron which held her teachings on compassion, support, and a bedside manner. The holocron came to be known as the Mournful Holocron because of Tresalis' overwhelming sadness at the loss of a loved one. In order to access the holocron, a user had to first console its gatekeeper and help the part of Tresalis imbued in the holocron cope with her loss.",
