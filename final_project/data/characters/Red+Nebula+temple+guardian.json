 "content": "The Red Nebula temple guardian was a giant hairy beast who, along with a priest, was charged with protecting the sacred crimson jewels which were important to the temple priests. When Han Solo and Chewbacca were forced by Klysk to attempt to steal the gems, they encountered the beast. But instead of attacking them she took hold of Chewbacca and cuddled him as though he were her cub. With the guardian distracted, Solo was free to take the gems from the temple and give them to Klysk.\nShe appears to share the same prolific stature as the Goraxes, the Bobog, and the Grudakk. However, it is unknown if any of them share the same genetic ancestry.",
