 "content": "Ysanna was a human female who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Ysanna resided with her husband onboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. Her husband was a soldier in the small military fore defending the station. In 1 ABY, a war erupted between Tansarii Point Station and the Rak'qua, an aggressive tribe of Nautolans living on Station Gamma, another space station in the Bright Jewel system. At some point, Ysanna's husband and his unit were dispatched to investigate disappearances on Station Gamma. After the soldiers engaged the Rak'qua, communications were lost and the unit never returned to Tansarii Point Station. Fearing for the safety of her husband, Ysanna contracted a spacer to travel to Station Gamma and bring back proof of what happened. Ysanna's fears proved to be correct; the spacer discovered that Ysanna's husband had gone mad from the violent fightings in that place. After killing the now-crazed soldier, the spacer presented the soldier's datapad to Ysanna as proof of what had happened. Though grief-stricken at the loss of her husband, she paid the spacer 1,500 credits.\nYsanna appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Ysanna was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
