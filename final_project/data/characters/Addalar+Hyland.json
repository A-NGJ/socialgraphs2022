 "content": "Addalar Hyland was a Human male who founded Galactic Solutions Industries, a personal weapons manufacturing company, on the moon of Nar Shaddaa around 3642 BBY as the Galactic War erupted. He also had a relative named Arnell Hyland who he employed at GSI Headquarters. The entrepreneur also founded The Hyland Organization for Rakghoul Neutralization , in hopes of eradicating the rakghoul plague in the galaxy; however, few were aware that Hyland had lost two of his children to the rakghoul pandemic on Tatooine. The loss of his children led him to divert a great deal of wealth to THORN in hopes of eliminating the plague.",
