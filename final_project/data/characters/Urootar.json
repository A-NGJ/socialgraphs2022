 "content": "Urootar was a male Human Jedi who had served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Going into hiding on Kashyyyk, he had descended into madness and strayed from the Jedi Path.\nA Force-sensitive, Urootar had received some form of formal training in the ways of the Force from the Jedi Order before the initiation of the Great Jedi Purge and the disbandment of the Order. With the rise of the Galactic Empire, Urootar fled into exile on the planet Kashyyyk where he set up a small hovel along the Rryatt Trail. Living in solidarity and living a life of relative obscurity, Urootar fell into madness without the Order.\nBy 1.5 ABY, as the Galactic Civil War kept the Galactic Empire busy and off the task of hunting Jedi, Urootar was considered dangerous by inhabitants of surrounding areas. Indeed, the Wookiee Krepauk hired a spacer who was passing through the area to kill the madman as he felt the Jedi was too dangerous to be left alive. The spacer completed the task, and Urootar became one with the Force, freeing him from his madness and finding redemption.\nUrootar appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
