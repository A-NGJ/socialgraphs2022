 "content": "Tae Diath was a male human Jedi Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He was the apprentice of his uncle, Jedi Master Nico Diath.\nA Force-sensitive human born into a family which had produced a long line of Jedi Knights, Tae Diath was quickly turned over to the Jedi Order to begin the training. Selected by his uncle, Jedi Master Nico Diath as a Padawan, young Diath had a strong bond with his master, focusing on his mind whenever he felt his control of his telepathic abilities was slipping. Under his master's instruction, Diath crafted for himself a green-bladed lightsaber.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Diath's took up ranks in the Grand Army of the Republic. Padawan Diath, now a Commander, led clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army alongside his master; however, on a mission without his Padawan, Master Diath was slain on Queyta. Following his master's death, a grieving Diath was dispatched to the battlefields of Jabiim where he became one of the orphaned Padawans comprising the Padawan Pack.\nAs the group worked together to survive through the battle's harsh conditions, Padawan Diath was often distracted by his mentor's death, often making comments about his Master's great ability and power. Combined with the stresses of war, Diath's grief caused his telepathic abilities to act up, causing Diath much discomfort and lack of clarity. To aid her comrade, fellow Padawan Elora Sund forged a mental link with Diath which allowed him to remain calm and in control. As the battle surged forward, the Padawans attempted to stand as the final defense of the Republic's sole remaining base. Defending it from the Jabiimi Nationalists and their leader, Alto Stratus, Diath was killed by several vicious A-series assassin droids. Upon his death, Padawan Sund was simultaneously killed as a result of psychic backlash.",
