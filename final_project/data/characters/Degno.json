 "content": "Degno was a male Gran who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDegno appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, he would have been on Tatooine. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game. Although the Interchange File lists his name as Degno, the game's creature database lists his name as Durr Roddack, which was actually the name used for a Human male NPC which made it onto the live servers.",
