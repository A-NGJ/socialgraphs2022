 "content": "A male Theelin Jedi youngling came to be trained by the Jedi Order sometime before the end of the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY, he perished at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant when the newly appointed Sith Lord Darth Vader led an attack against the Jedi.\nIn 19 BBY, a youngling was among a group of five Jedi Initiates—including Reva Sevander—that were led through a training routine by Jedi Master Minas Velti within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, when the Grand Army of the Republic executed Order 66—the command to eliminate the Jedi—under the authority of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As part of the siege of the Jedi Temple, clone troopers of the 501st Legion interrupted Velti's training and opened fire upon the Jedi Initiate Clan. Velti defended herself and the younglings, striking the troopers down in the process. She then led her younglings through the Temple, protecting them from troopers along the way. Velti was soon overwhelmed by clone troopers and was killed in combat.\nThough Velti died in the escape, she protected the group of younglings, who were able to use her sacrifice to run. However, Velti's death only delayed the inevitable as the Sith Lord Darth Vader found the younglings and slaughtered them all, except for Reva.\nIn 9 BBY, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi gained entry into a secure chamber in Fortress Inquisitorius, where he discovered the remains of several fallen Jedi, including the youngling, perfectly preserved in stasis.\nA member of the Theelin species, the male Jedi youngling had small horns on either side of his face and spotted, mottled skin.\nThe Jedi youngling was played by twin martial artists Jonathan and Oliver Ho in the TV series Obi-Wan Kenobi. The two filmed their part in the summer of 2021, and got to meet and have scenes with Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. The part where Obi-Wan Kenobi finds the remains of their character preserved in stasis in \"Part IV\" required wire work. Although it does not show very well on-screen, the two wore special make-up to transform their character into a Theelin with tiny horns and spotted, mottled skin.",
