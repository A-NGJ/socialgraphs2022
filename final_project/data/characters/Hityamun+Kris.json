 "content": "Hityamun \"Hitch\" Kris was a Human male Black Sun Vigo and a former Mandalorian who turned his back on his clan to join the Black Sun. He was once in a relationship with holostar Javul Charn, the two were engaged into a marriage before Javul broke it off once she discovered Hityamum had been smuggling illegal goods aboard her starship. Despite being a former Mandalorian, most of his bodyguards were seen in Mandalorian armor besides one, indicating he still has ties to his former culture.",
