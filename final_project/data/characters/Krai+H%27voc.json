 "content": "Krai H'voc was a Nagai and parent of Ozrei N'takkilomandrife.\nKrai was a scout for the Nagi sent out to find the legendary \"Skyriver\". Instead of searching and observing the galaxy, Krai settled down on Corellia, where she fell in love with a human male and gave birth to a child, Bey. When it was discovered by Nagai commanders that Krai was not doing her job, she was ordered to leave her family and continue her mission elsewhere. She left her family with little explanation. After the Battle of Yavin, Krai suggested to the Nagai commanders that the invasion of the galaxy should wait until the war was over.\nThe character's name is a reference to the line, \"Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war,\" from William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.",
