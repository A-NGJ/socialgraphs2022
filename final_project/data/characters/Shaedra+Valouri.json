 "content": "Shaedra Valouri was a Human female Corellian Security Force lieutenant who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. She was murdered after it was discovered that she helped her friend, Denell Kel'Vannon.\nShaedra Valouri was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Shaedra Valouri spawned under the generic \"corsec_lieutenant\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of four possible depictions. She could either appear as a brown haired, brown eyed Human male wearing either an officer's uniform or a pilot's jumpsuit, or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female wearing either the officer's uniform or pilot's jumpsuit. Because the quest dialogue identified Valouri as female, this article assumes that the Human female depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity. However, the type of clothing she wore cannot be definitively determined.",
