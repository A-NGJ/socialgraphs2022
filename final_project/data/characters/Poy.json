 "content": "Poy was a male Twi'lek slave of the Yuuzhan Vong on the moon Yavin 4 alongside the Jedi Anakin Solo in 26 ABY. During their time together as slaves, Solo asked Poy about the differences between the implants he had seen used on Yuuzhan Vong slaves on the planet Dantooine and the implants used on Yavin 4. Poy explained that the implants Solo saw on Dantooine were used on those the warrior caste planned to send into battle, because they destroyed the ability of the slaves to think. Because Poy and the others enslaved on Yavin 4 served the shaper caste, who needed their slaves intelligent enough to follow directions, their implants only conditioned them to obey and caused them pain. He warned Solo that if he acted out, the shapers would fit him with the implants used by the warriors' slaves and send him to the war front to fight.\nPoy first appeared in the 2001 novel The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest, written by Greg Keyes.",
