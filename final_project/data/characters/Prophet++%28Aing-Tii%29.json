 "content": "The Prophet was a male Aing-Tii who lived around the time of the Second Galactic Civil War. He was known for making many specific predictions, all of which came true. The most controversial of these was his belief that the Aing-Tii deities, Those Who Dwell Beyond the Veil, would come to the Aing-Tii homeworld before his death. However, around 43 ABY, soon after making this prophecy, the Prophet died, and there was still no sign of Those Who Dwell Beyond the Veil. This event threw the Aing-Tii into turmoil, splitting them into two factions.",
