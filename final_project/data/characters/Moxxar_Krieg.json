 "content": "Moxxar Krieg was a male individual who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Krieg and Doctor Edvar Vang discovered the existence of a new kind of spice. This spice was trafficked by the Rebel Alliance but was also sought by the powerful criminal organization Black Sun. While Vang considered that the situation had become too dangerous, Krieg continued to look into the source of the spice. He was then detected and threatened to stop his investigation. However, Moxxar Krieg refused to do so and was finally assassinated in his house in Mos Eisley. In 1 ABY, a group of spacers discovered a sample of the new spice while looking for a missing pilot, Cal Handro. They brought it to Doctor Vang but the latter exhorted them to interrogate Krieg instead of him. The spacers only found the corpse of Moxxar Krieg in his house.\nMoxxar Krieg appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Moxxar Krieg was added to the game with the first chapter of the \"Secrets of the Syren\" questline, released with the \"Publish 14,\" on March 9, 2005. The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"Chapter 1,\" published on June 8, 2006, due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the Battle of Restuss.",
