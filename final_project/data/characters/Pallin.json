 "content": "Lieutenant Pallin was an officer in the Imperial Army during the Yuuzhan Vong War who was stationed on the planet of Ord Sedra. The lieutenant was known to have cooperated with Jedi Master Kyle Katarn and New Republic agent Jan Ors in stopping a series of slave raids being conducted by the Yuuzhan Vong and Peace Brigaders.\nEarly scripts of \"Equals \u0026 Opposites\" had named this character Lieutenant Ducce, which was meant to be pronounced \"Doo-chuh\", but writer Nathan P. Butler decided that it would be far too easy for fans to read \"Ducce\" and pronounce it like a certain feminine hygiene product. The name was promptly changed.",
