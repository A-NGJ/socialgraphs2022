A skiff racer, Hakin joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic shortly before the Battle of Yavin in the year 0 BBY.

He joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic shortly before the Battle of Yavin in the year 0 BBY, eventually becoming a corporal. That year, Hakin was among the Rebel troopers stationed aboard the Alderaanian Senator Leia Organa's CR90 corvette, the Tantive IV. Rebel spies transmitted the stolen plans of the Galactic Empire's DS-1 Orbital Battle Station superweapon to the vessel, leading to its pursuit and overtaking by the Dark Lord Darth Vader's personal flagship, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. Hakin and the rest of the Rebel troopers unsuccessfully attempted to defend the ship from the invading stormtroopers.\nHakin had light skin, brown hair, and blue eyes. During his time aboard the Tantive IV, he sported a thin mustache and wore a typical Rebel trooper uniform. Due to his skiff-racing experience, Hakin knew how to bargain on the black market, a skill valued by the Rebel Alliance. Hakin wielded a DH-17 blaster pistol.\nHakin was created by Decipher's 2001 Premiere set of the Jedi Knights Trading Card Game.",
