 "content": "Boffen Nibs was a male Drall who lived on the planet Drall. The son of Duchess Lassa Nibs, he stole a large diamond known as the Eye of Corell from her which traced their family line back for many generations. He stole the diamond due to a wish for excitement and adventure, and planned to use it to fund the beginnings of a criminal career. He then fled, being chase by the local police, and found a group of spacers in a market near the Boiling Sea. He offered to pay the group 500 to help him evade capture, but was willing to pay them up to the full 2000 credit sticks he carried on him in his utility belt. A self-centered and naive individual, Nibs was good at lying and generally deceitful behaviour, telling those he begged for help that he had been falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit. At the time he begged for help he looked particularly disheveled, with matted and dirty fur.\nBoffen Nibs first appeared as a character in the adventure module \"Beyond the Boiling Sea\", one of several modules included in the Suns of Fortune sourcebook for the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying system. The book, which was released in 2014, gave several ways in which the players, whom were the spacers Nibs begged for help, could react but favored no one option and so this article makes no assumption about what action was taken.",
