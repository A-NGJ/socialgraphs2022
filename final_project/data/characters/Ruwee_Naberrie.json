 "content": "Ruwee Naberrie was a human male and a member of the Naberrie family. He was the father of Sola Naberrie and Padmé Amidala. During his lifetime, his strongest ally in the Galactic Senate was Onaconda Farr of Rodia. His daughter Padmé became elected queen and later member of the Senate of the Galactic Republic for their homeworld.\nSon of a cloth weaver in the Naberrie family, Ruwee married a woman named Jobal at some point. They had two daughters, Sola and Padmé. To live with his family, Ruwee built with his own roughened hands a stone house. He held careers as an educator, builder, and relief worker.\nSometime later Ruwee met Senator Onaconda Farr of Rodia, who became his strongest ally in the Galactic Senate.\nWhen Padmé was a child, she traveled with her father on relief missions to offer relief to suffering planets. They traveled together to Shadda-Bi-Boran to help resettle the population after an ecological disaster when Padmé was seven years old. The effort, however, failed as Shadda-Bi-Boran could not adapt to their new homeland. It caused Ruwee to declare that he would try 10,000 times to save a person later in his life.\nWhen Padmé turned fourteen years old, she ran and was elected Queen of Naboo and adopted the name of \"Padmé Amidala.\" In the few days leading up to the election Rwuee hadn't seen Padmé except on holos as she gave last-minute campaign speeches and the morning of the election when she and the other candidates cast their live ballots. Rwuee voted for his daughter, though he secretly wished she hadn't run. After Padmé leaned that she had won the election she called her parents who told her they were proud of her and reminded her that they loved her and to be herself before the call had to be ended for Rwuee's usual postelection get-togther.\nSuccessful and well-liked, she served two two-year terms, including during the Invasion of Naboo. Though she'd planned to retire from public life, Padmé was asked by her successor, Réillata, to represent Naboo in the Senate. That same day she informed Ruwee and Jobal of her decision.\nIn 28 BBY, Ruwee's daughter Sola had her first baby, Ryoo; making him a grandfather. Shortly after Ryoo's birth Padmé returned home and she and her entourage helped Rwuee on a greenhouse he was building for the local school so that they could have flowers to study and draw during the cold season. Rwuee came to greatly like Padmé's new handmaiden Dormé who he claimed was the best carver he had seen in ten years. Sola joked that Rwuee wanted to adopt her.\nShortly before the Clone Wars, his daughter Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker visited them.\nFollowing the end of the Clone Wars and the execution of Order 66, Padmé died on Polis Massa. Ruwee attended Padmé's funeral with Jobal, Sola, Ryoo and Pooja Naberrie. The family wore black to reflect their sadness and mourning.\nRuwee had ruddy cheeks along with blue eyes and dark hair.\nHe was a staunch pacifist. By the time his daughter became queen, he had left politics in the past a long time ago save when some cause pulled him back in and made use of his extensive offworld contacts however he was \"no stranger\" to its workings. Rwuee didn't want Padmé to become queen, though he did vote for her, as he wanted his daughters to be happy first and to provide their service to the planet outside of that happiness. He knew that being elected would make Padmé happy but it would always be tied to something else. While his wife Jobal always encouraged Padmé's dreams, Rwuee tempered them with practicalities just as much though they were both showing love.\nRwuee was known at least by reputation to most of the important people of Naboo and had a gift of knowing how to be friends with powerful people without taking advantage of it something which his daughter Padmé greatly admired about him. He rarely slipped up.\nAlthough Rwuee didn't always agree with the methods of Captain Quarsh Panaka, Rwuee came to understand him as he kept everyone safe so that they could keep his daughter safe. Rwuee was also fond of Padmé's handmaiden Dormé due to her wood carving skills. Rwuee was also a talented wood carver having made a greenhouse for a local school so that they could have flowers to study and draw during the cold season.\nRuwee wore a somber black and dark red robe to his daughter's funeral, with the dark tones reflecting the family's sadness and mourning at Amidala's death.\nRuwee Naberrie was portrayed by Graeme Blundell in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.\nDuring the filming of Attack of the Clones, Blundell traveled to Lake Como, Italy in order to shoot his scenes as Ruwee Naberrie, but all his scenes were deleted from the film's final cut. His scenes at the end of Revenge of the Sith, however, remained unchanged and made it into the finished version of the film.\nRuwee's card from the digital card game Star Wars: Force Collection erroneously lists him as Qui-Gon Jinn's father.",
