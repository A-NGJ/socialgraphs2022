 "content": "Jabbat was a male Grindalid who served as Head, the lead child of the White Worm criminal organization on the planet Corellia. At some point he disappeared resulting in the position being opened up to members of the gang including Han, Qi'ra, and Rebolt. After being asked by Han if she knew what had happened to the last Head, Qi'ra who sought to gain the position, noted that all of the gang's scrumrats had heard murmurings of what had happened, that Jabbat had mysteriously disappeared in territory owned by Old Man Powlo. Qi'ra also noted that rumor was that Lady Proxima, the gang's leader, had dumped Jabbat's body in Powlo's lair on purpose and that Jabbat had been served up to Powlo as part of a deal.",
