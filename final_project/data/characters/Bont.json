 "content": "Bont was a member of a group of pirates that had been stealing shipments of high tech supplies from around Gadrin. The pirates were using a landing platform hidden in Cularin's jungles west of Gadrin. Bont was assigned with Kerner to keep people out of the sector near the landing platform. When a speeder bearing a group of people looking for Darin entered the area, the pirates attempted to shoot them down. Kerner lost control and crashed early on, but Bont kept on the chase. The people in the speeder eventually shot him down, although their speeder ended up damaged and crashed.",
