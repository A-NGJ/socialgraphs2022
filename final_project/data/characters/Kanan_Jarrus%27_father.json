 "content": "This human male was the father of Kanan Jarrus. Jarrus never knew his father as he was taken from his family at a young age to be trained as a Padawan. The miner Okadiah Garson, whom Jarrus knew during his time on Gorse eight years after the rise of the Galactic Empire, attempted to be a father figure to him, and Jarrus thought that his own father might have been somewhat like Garson. He was the paternal grandfather of Jacen Syndulla.",
