 "content": "Macken was a Snivvian female who served the Galactic Republic as Station Controller of Relay Post Epsilon One. While overseeing the space station, she realized that her colleage, Chief Technician Raleigh, had forgotten to activate the station's Targes scanner, a device that warned of starships arriving from hyperspace. Upon activating the scanner, they were alerted to the arrival of ships from hyperspace, which turned out to be a group of Nihil Stormships and the Lourna Dee, the starship of Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee. Macken sent a distress call to Starlight Beacon as the Nihil attacked the station, who sent Jedi Order and Republic Defense Coalition forces. As the Nihil fought the Jedi and Republic in what became known as the Battle of Galov, Macken and Raleigh were rescued by Jedi Master Sskeer and Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis and brought to safety.\nMacken appeared in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast.",
