 "content": "Stax Mullawny was a male Human from the planet Corellia. Mullawny served as a gunner for the eighth T-47 airspeeder of Rogue Group, a Rebel Alliance squadron, during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY when Imperial troops attacked the Rebels stationed there. He was killed during the battle when an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport shot down his airspeeder.\nStax Mullawny was a scarred male Human from the planet Corellia. Mullawny joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic around the time the Alliance's headquarters were on the desolate planet Hoth at Echo Base, as the Rebels tried to overthrow the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. He was part of the base's starfighter pilot complement that composed Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron, and Green Squadron.\nIn 3 ABY, an Imperial Viper probe droid discovered the existence of the Rebel presence on Hoth, leading the Imperial Military's Death Squadron to attack the Rebels there. Mullawny was one of the many Rebel pilots from the starfighter complement who were scrambled together to create Rogue Group. A gunner in the T-47 airspeeder designated Rogue Eight, Mullawny flew with pilot Zev Kabir as Rogue Group attempted to buy time for the Rebel personnel to evacuate Echo Base aboard GR-75 medium transports. As Rogue Group confronted the Imperial forces, an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport walker shot down Mullawny's T-47, killing both him and Kabir.\nMullawny was a scarred, sardonic person, and a tinkerer who knew an immense amount about the weaker points of Imperial facilities and equipment.\nStax Mullawny's T-47 first appeared in 1999's Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back 1, an adaption of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, released in 1980. Mullawny was first identified as the T-47's gunner in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare, an extensive Guide dedicated to the conflicts in the galaxy, written by Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart.",
