 "content": "Lanniter Droge was a Human male scientist who worked for the rebellious Sith Lord Grathan on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas. Unlike some of his fellow scientists, Lanniter volunteered to work for Grathan due to the fact the Sith was the only person who had the resources required for the scientist's work. While on Lord Grathan's estate, Lanniter designed revolutionary cybernetic replacement limbs for the Sith Lord, who intended to give them to his wounded soldiers, although Lanniter himself hoped that they would also be given to the civilian victims of the Great Galactic War. However, Ismar Brengle, one of Lanniter's colleagues, planned to steal the cybernetics and sell them to the highest bidder, much to his dismay.",
