 "content": "Forrs was a male Human who served as a lieutenant in the Republic Army during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire, when he was stationed the space station Carrick Station.\nLieutenant Forrs appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendors for the Trooper class; his actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
