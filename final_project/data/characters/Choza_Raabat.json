 "content": "Choza Raabat was a male Ithorian Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire until he was stranded in the depths of the Unknown Regions after his starship crashed in a scouting mission. Raabat survived for ten years before he encountered a patrol ship from the Eternal Empire, which he was forced to commandeer and use to escape after they opened fire on him. Raabat returned to find the galaxy under the control of the Eternal Empire, and worked with the Alliance to free Alderaan from their control.\nAn Ithorian male, Choza Raabat served the Jedi Order as a Jedi Knight during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, Raabat embarked on a scouting mission to Wild Space, but he barely survived a crash on an uninhabited and uncharted planet that destroyed his starship and astromech droid. Raabat was marooned on that world for an entire decade, surviving alone until 3633 BBY when a patrol ship from the Eternal Empire of the planet Zakuul set down to survey the world. The crew opened fire on the alien when he introduced himself and requested rescue, forcing Raabat to incapacitate them and commandeer their vessel. Interrogating his prisoners, Raabat learned of the Eternal Empire's conquest of the galaxy and returned to the Core Worlds, where he found planets such as Alderaan under the control of massive Star Fortresses. Together with the Commander, the leader of an Alliance against the Eternal Empire, Raabat rallied some of the local nobility and destroyed the shield bunker protecting the Star Fortress, and formally joined the Alliance after the destruction of the Alderaan Star Fortress.\nChoza Raabat was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the Digital Expansion Knights of the Fallen Empire, as the local contact for Alderaan in the Star Fortress series of missions.",
