 "content": "Oro was a male Mon Calamari who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nOro was a male Mon Calamari who worked as an aide to Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel Alliance, and he was also secretly employed by the Galactic Empire. In 0 ABY, Oro spent some time with the Imperial General Sebastian Parnell on Tol Ado, an Imperial prison planet, and the Mon Calamari revealed to the Empire some information that compromised an Alliance operation in the Sil'Lume system. Afterward, Oro departed from Tol Ado aboard a starship and, unknown to the Mon Calamari, he was observed by Luke Skywalker, a member of the Alliance who had stowed away aboard the ship. Oro eventually made it to Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4 and after Skywalker arrived at the base, General Jan Dodonna summoned Skywalker to a meeting with Mon Mothma and Oro, to discuss the recently compromised Alliance operation. Skywalker immediately recognized Oro and deduced that the Mon Calamari had compromised the operation in the Sil'Lume system, so Skywalker ignited his lightsaber and held it to Oro's throat.\nOro was created by Troy Denning and appeared in a role-playing strand in the 1990 West End Games role-playing supplement Jedi's Honor.",
