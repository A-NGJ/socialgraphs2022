 "content": "Deej was an Ewok male who lived in Bright Tree Village as part of the Bright Tree tribe on the Forest Moon of Endor. He and another Ewok were the parents to four children: Weechee, Widdle Warrick, Wicket Warrick, and Winda.\nOne winter, he and a hunting party left the village in order to obtain essential supplies. Weechee was able to convince his father to let him come with, which made Wicket, who was younger, jealous. Wicket was watching when his father came back with their spoils, which included a large kublag and brub berries. Later that day, Weechee told his young brother that he felt that he took after Deej, noting that he was very strong. Deej wore snowshoes when traveling in the snow.\nDeej first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in \"The Kroolok,\" a short story written by George Mann and Cavan Scott and published in the 2021 short story collection the Life Day Treasury. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Deej Warrick was introduced in the 1984 television film, Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure.",
