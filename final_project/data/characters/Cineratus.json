 "content": "Cineratus, born Jevan, was a Human male Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. His father chose the Sith name of Cineratus for him, though Cineratus preferred his birth name. Wishing to stay independent, he became on agent of Darth Thanaton and was sent to Quesh, claiming a want to \"stay off Thanaton's hit list.\" He slew Corrin and Kaal, apprentices of Lord Kallig, and waited at the site of their deaths to slay their master. Upon Kallig's arrival, Cineratus insisted that his actions were not personally reflected and that he was only doing the job on Thanaton's behalf. He was killed by Kallig in the ensuing duel.",
