 "content": "Balic Cormac was a Human male captain in the military forces of House Organa during the Alderaan Civil War and the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Balic and his troops captured a House Thul prisoner named Markus Thul who was leading a group of Imperial commandos to sneak inside the castle Organa. He was ordered to place the prisoner inside the Organa's detention center on Alderaan and find out information that he was hiding. Eventually, Balic encountered the new Havoc squad lieutenant who was sent by General Elin Garza to search for Gearbox, who was one of the traitors from Havoc Squad. Balic was able to provide everything and set the security doors to grant access for the lieutenant to interrogate the prisoner.\nAfter Markus provided the intel and begging the Havoc lieutenant to save his family, Balic didn't believe that Markus was telling the truth. He was seen with Pallos Organa after the Havoc lieutenant was able to stop an Imperial missile that Gearbox launched to destroy Castle Organa.",
