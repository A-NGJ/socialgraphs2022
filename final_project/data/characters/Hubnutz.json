 "content": "Hubnutz was a short-snouted male Rodian student at the Orsis Academy who often felt disdain to a young Maul who was also enrolled there. Skilled in tracking and sharp-shooting, he teamed up with Meltch Krakko and fellow Rodian Fretch in a combat mission against Maul in the Vale of Pale Tears in 39 BBY. Sporting a mimetic suit, respirator mask and a blaster, Hubnutz and the other two were defeated after Maul had used the Force to gain the upper hand. He was eventually killed by Maul, along with the rest of the school, per Darth Sidious's orders.",
