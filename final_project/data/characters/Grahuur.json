 "content": "Grahuur was a Wookiee male hunter who was alive during the time of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Around the year 3643 BBY, while at his camp in the swamps outside the city of Jiguuna on the planet Nal Hutta, the Wookiee hunter was killed by an individual affiliated with the Empire.\nA Wookiee male, Grahuur was a hunter who lived during the time of the Cold War, a period of unrest between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Around the year 3643 BBY, Grahuur had a camp in the swamps outside the city of Jiguuna on the planet Nal Hutta.\nWhile on Nal Hutta, Grahuur was killed in combat at his camp by an individual who was affiliated with the Sith Empire.\nGrahuur had brown fur, dark-colored skin, and light-blue eyes.\nDuring his time at his camp on Nal Hutta, Grahuur wore a dull-green-colored vest and a bandolier. He was armed with a wrist-mounted blade as well as a sniper rifle equipped with both a scope and a laser sight.\nGrahuur first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 BioWare–LucasArts MMORPG. In the game, he appears as a lower-level boss on Nal Hutta—known in-game as Hutta—the starting planet for the bounty hunter and Imperial agent classes. However, any Imperial player class—bounty hunter, Imperial agent, Sith Inquisitor, or Sith Warrior—can kill Grahuur, and the Wookiee's death is one of the required kills for completing the \"Hutta's Most Wanted\" achievement. While the achievement is not required to continue with any of the main storylines, this article is written with the assumption of 100 percent game completion.",
