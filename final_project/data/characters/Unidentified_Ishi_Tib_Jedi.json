 "content": "This individual was a male Ishi Tib Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final decades of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive trained in the Force by the Jedi Order, this Ishi-Tib had achieved the rank of Jedi Knight sometime before 33 BBY, having constructed for himself a green-bladed lightsaber sometime before that. In that year, a serious of uprisings were springing up throughout the Yinchorri system, a conflict which drew most of the Jedi High Council away from Coruscant. Stationed at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at the time, this Jedi was present when a group of Yinchorri infiltrated the Tower of First Knowledge in an attempt to slay the Jedi Initiates housed there. The Jedi in the Temple attacked the raiding party in force, this Ishi-Tib among their number. Successful, the invaders were repelled and the Jedi only suffered two casualties, Jedi Tieren Nie-Tan and Jude Rozess.\nThis Ishi-Tib Jedi was created by penciller David√© Fabbri for the second issue of the Jedi Council: Acts of War comic book arc. Depicted at the beginning of the conflict in the Jedi Temple, this has been the Jedi's only appearance to date.",
