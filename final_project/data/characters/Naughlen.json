 "content": "Naughlen was a male Human commander of the Galactic Republic during the time of the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY he was stationed on Nar Shaddaa and together with lieutenant Weggland was defending Outpost Shylon from an Imperial attack led by General Kligton when the apprentice of Darth Baras arrived on the scene. The apprentice was systematically dismantling the power base of Sith Lord Rathari whom Kligton answered to and attacked his men when the General refused to switch sides. After Kligton and his soldiers were slain, Naughlen attempted to negotiate with the apprentice on behalf of himself and the garrison only to be slain by the Sith.\nThe Sith Warrior could choose to spare Naughlen and his men and his men or attack and kill them. If Naughlen and his men are spared, they will help the warrior defeat Rathari and his troops. After defeating Rathari and his forces, the warrior could choose to spare him for light side points or kill him.",
