 "content": "Zogor Sturm was a Human male officer of the Galactic Empire's Commission for the Preservation of the New Order who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nZogor Sturm appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Zogor Sturm would have been located on Naboo. However, Zogor Sturm is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
