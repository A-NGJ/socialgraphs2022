 "content": "Stren Colo was a Human male Imperial officer who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he was stationed in Kachirho on the forest planet of Kashyyyk. Colo worked as an Imperial bounty officer; his job was to post and redeem bounties. During that time, he was contacted by the bartender Tien Wallub who placed a bounty on a the Trandoshan Jessk who had been catch cheating at sabacc. Around the same time, Belga Daeri, a spaceport official, placed a bounty on Dorn Nareusu, a pirate who had destroyed several transport ships in the Kashyyyk system. Jessk was later shot down on the planet Tatooine while Dorn Nareusu was killed in a space battle above Kashyyyk. Stren Colo eventually rewarded the bounty hunters for their work.\nStren Colo appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Stren Colo was added to the game with the release of the expansion pack Rage of the Wookiees on May 5, 2005.",
