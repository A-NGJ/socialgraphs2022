 "content": "Chai was a female Corellian Human who was married to the man Bern during the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, Chai's sister, the scientist Bant'ena Fhernan, was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Confederacy forced Fhernan to work for them by claiming that they would kill Chai and Fherman's other family members if she refused to co-operate with them. The CIS put Chai and Bern under surveillance and a Confederacy droidcam recorded footage of Chai, Bern and their sons disembarking from a transport on the planet Alderaan while on their way to their annual camping vacation.",
