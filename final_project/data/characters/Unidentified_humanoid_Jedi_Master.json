 "content": "A humanoid Jedi Master with pointed ears was among the founders of the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, collectively known as the Four Masters. A monument in his or her effigy was placed at the main entrance of the Temple, but was destroyed millennia later following the start of Operation: Knightfall at the end of the Clone Wars.\nA humanoid Jedi Master served the Jedi Order around 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin. When the Jedi enclave of planet Ossus and its Great Jedi Library were brought to the ground by the Brotherhood of the Sith, that Jedi Master and three other colleagues were tasked with the construction of new headquarters for the Order. Together, the Four Masters established a new Jedi Temple on the site of the Sacred Spire, a natural peak located on the galactic capital of Coruscant, where earlier generations of Jedi had already erected small meditative chapels. The humanoid Master and his fellow founders were remembered through a series of four engraved pylons that ornated the formal entrance to their Temple. Those statues, however, were either toppled or destroyed at the end of the Clone Wars during \"Operation: Knightfall,\" when the Sith Lord Darth Vader stormed the Temple with a detachment of the 501st Legion's clone troopers.\nIf their engraved effigy integrated into the Temple's fa√ßade was accurate, the Jedi Master belonged to species of bulky, bald sentients with tapered ears. He or she sported long robes with wide sleeves and a double collar, and wielded some sort of pole weapon.\nThat Jedi Master's species remained unidentified. However, that individual shared his pointed ears and bald head with the inhabitants of the Red Nebula shown in Star Wars  50, the fiftieth issue in the Marvel Star Wars series of comics. When clarification on the pointy-eared Valenthyne Farfalla was sought from Leland Chee, keeper of the Holocron continuity database, he shared his personal theory that \"all pointy-eared species are either Sephi or closely related to Sephi,\" a reference to a pointy-eared species from Jedi: Yoda, published in 2004. The original design of the Four Masters' bas-reliefs was done by Ryan Church, Concept Design Supervisor for Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.",
