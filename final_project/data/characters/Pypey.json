 "content": "Pypey was a Force-sensitive Ithorian child and the son of Oora, living on the planet Takobo a few years before the Battle of Yavin. He was targeted for abduction or assassination by Imperial Inquisitors Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister, but was rescued by rebels Garazeb Orrelios, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, and Ahsoka Tano and reunited with his mother. Before being reunited with his mother he attempted to grab Ezra's blade, but was unable.\nPrior to being rescued by members of the rebel Phoenix Cell, Pypey lived with his mother Oora in the Hammertown district of Takobo Cityâ€”the capital of the planet Takobo.\nPypey was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who also voices Captain Rex, Admiral Kassius Konstantine, and many other characters in Star Wars Rebels. Though the child's name is given as \"Pypey\" in the Star Wars Databank, both the closing credits and captions of \"The Future of the Force\" give the spelling \"Pipey.\" He was originally going to be named \"Pypie,\" but the spelling was changed during production. The house that Oora and Pypey live in features a cloth with the same repeating pattern that is sewn or printed on the material that Alora is swaddled in.",
