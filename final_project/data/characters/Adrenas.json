 "content": "Adrenas was a male Human from the Outer Rim who spoke Ryl rather than Basic as his native tongue. Although he could also speak Basic he refused because he feared his strong accent would be mocked. He worked as the chamberlain at the Sith Academy on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War. However, despite his membership he did not train or study as a proper Sith student. Adrenas met his death, together with his fellows, when Revan killed his way through the complex after finding the world's Star Map.\nIf the player informs Uthar Wynn about Yuthura Ban's plot to overthrow him, then the player has the option of siding with Wynn. Adrenas will agree to poison Yuthura's bath.",
