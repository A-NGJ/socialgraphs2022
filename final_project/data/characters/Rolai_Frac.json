 "content": "Rolai Frac was a male Bothan member of a squad of young mercenaries that trained secretly at the elite Leadership School of Andara during the Republic Classic era, before the Clone Wars.\nShort in stature, with long, curling hair down to his shoulders, Frac was in charge of the group's finances and served as security expert.\nOstracized by the wealthier students because he was admitted to the school on scholarship, Frac and the other squad members planned to kill Jedi Anakin Skywalker and frame a wealthy politicianâ€”the Senator-father, in fact, of his squad's mercenary leader, Gillam Tarturi. The plan was foiled by Skywalker and his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who arrested the young mercenaries and took them to Coruscant upon their expulsion from the school, to sort out the lies, betrayals, and criminal activity that had occurred within the group.",
