 "content": "Zaoron was a Human male Dread Commander of the Dread Host during the Dread War. He was stationed on Oricon in 3638 BBY. Zaoron commanded the central watchtower and had custody over its computer core. When a spacer penetrated the tower's defenses and deactivated the battle droids assigned to protect it, Zaoron engaged a manual override of the final defensive system and chose to engage the intruder in person. Despite his skill in combat, Zaoron was killed and the computer core was taken.\nZaoron wielded two lightsabers in combat and was extremely skilled. He utilized a series of attack flurries that were capable of dealing tremendous damage to any opponent. His combat abilities integrated both Jedi and Sith combat maneuvers as well as unique techniques.\nZaoron serves as the final encounter of the quest 'The Tower's Core' on Oricon. He utilizes combat maneuvers from both Jedi Sentinel and Sith Marauder combat trees, as well as unique abilities. This article assumes 100% game completion which means he was killed.",
