He was the commander of Rust Squadron.\nDorrian Vodani is a quiet and introspective, and likes to read old texts written by corrimias, a Philosopher who Dorrian honored and lived by his teachings. unfortunately, his quiet and antisocial personality makes him a big suspect of being a traitor to the Ardan resistance. Eventually he is ruled out of being a traitor because he shares his philosophies of peace and equality with his peers.",
