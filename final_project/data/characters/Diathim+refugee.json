 "content": "This individual was a Diathim native to Millius Prime, a moon in orbit of the Outer Rim world of Iego. During the Clone Wars, Millius Prime, the rest of Iego's moons, and the planet itself were invaded by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Confederate forces pushed the Diathim inhabitants off of Millius Prime, causing them to seek refuge on the planet below. This particular Diathim took up temporary residence in the town of Cliffhold, where she later met with Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker during their mission to free the people of Iego from the malevolent god called \"Drol.\" After hearing from the Diathim refugee, the two Jedi deduced that Drol was not a god, but in fact a Confederate LaserWeb Defense Station whose primary node was located on Millius Prime. The two succeeded in destroying the station and freeing the people of Iego.",
