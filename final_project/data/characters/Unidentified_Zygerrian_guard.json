 "content": "Around 21 BBY, this Zygerrian was working as a guard in a slave pit on the planet Zygerria.\nFollowing a mission to infiltrate the slavers on Zygerria, High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and captain Rex arrived at a slave pit to rescue the Togrutan governor of Kiros, Roshti, but the rescue attempt fails when Obi-Wan was spotted and shot down by Zygerrian guards. Obi-Wan was then chained to a wall and this guard tortured him with a Shock whip to make him talk. The torture was momentarily stopped when the the Zygerrian supervisor, Atai Molec arrived to see if the Jedi has said anything. This guard then continued to whip Obi-Wan until Atai Molec realized who the Jedi actually was.",
