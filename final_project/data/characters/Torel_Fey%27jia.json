 "content": "Torel Fey'jia was a male Bothan and a member of Clan Ojia. Along with his clan-mates, he migrated and colonized the planet Kothlis. Once under the employ of MCS, Torel embezzled enough funds to support himself, even after the company's collapse. He later started his own business buying and selling top-secret corporate information, using his profits to establish one of the largest spynets on Kothlis. With this information, his good friend, Borsk Fey'lya, was kept informed of anything of interest from the colony.",
