 "content": "Savar was a Human male captain in Galactic Alliance Security. He and a group of Security troops arrested Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker in 43 ABY for dereliction of duty. Savar then took Skywalker to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse, though the Jedi was released soon thereafter. Savar later led the Security forces under the orders of Chief of State Natasi Daala to capture Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who had become a fugitive after suffering a psychotic breakdown. Horn was caught by Skywalker, however, and Savar and Skywalker eventually agreed that Horn should be placed in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center, a secure facility located about halfway between the Jedi and Galactic Alliance Security jurisdictions.\nSavar, a Human male, worked as a captain in Galactic Alliance Security on the galactic capital of Coruscant. In 43.5 ABY, acting on orders from the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances government, Savar enlisted the assistance of three bounty huntersâ€”Quarren inventor Dhidal Nyz, Human hunter Zilaash Kuh, and Skakoan hunter Hrym Mawarr. Savar led the hunters and a GA Security team to arrest Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker for failing to prevent Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord Darth Caedus's fall to the dark side of the Force. During the arrest, Skywalker, who was accompanied by several other Jedi as well as ex-smuggler Han Solo, did not cooperate precisely to Savar's specifications, handing his lightsaber to Jedi Knight Leia Organa Solo instead of turning it over to the Security troops. Han Solo insulted Savar as tensions rose, and and Savar stiffened.\nNyz, assuming that Skywalker was attempting to use the Force on Savar, exclaimed that Skywalker was resisting the arrest. One of Savar's troopers, Bessen, panicked and opened fire. The shot missed, and Jedi Master Kam Solusar deflected it with his lightsaber. Solo shot Bessen's blaster, destroying it, and the situation was brought back under control. Savar devised a punishment for Bessen, ordering the man to perform calisthenics and run back to the barracks, and then led Skywalker to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse. Savar felt sympathy for Skywalker, and though he never gave anyone any reason to believe that he did not approve of Chief of State Natasi Daala's decision to arrest the Grand Master, Skywalker felt Savar's regret through the Force.\nSavar later led the Security forces sent by Daala to capture Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who had gone on a destructive rampage through Coruscant after suffering a psychotic breakdown. Horn was caught by Luke Skywalker, who had been released from the blockhouse. Savar ordered that Skywalker hand Horn over to Security forces, but Skywalker suggested that Horn be taken to the Jedi Temple and studied there. Leia Organa Solo eventually proposed a compromise that both Skywalker and Savar agreed to: Horn was placed in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center, a secure facility located about halfway between the Jedi Temple and the Senate Building. They agreed that Horn was set to be studied by six Jedi and six Security agents, and no bounty hunters or press were to be allowed access to the facility.\nCaptain Savar was a firm and imposing officer, and exerted his authority over his subordinates. He expected each of his troops to operate efficiently and follow his orders, and when they did not, he was often rather harsh in punishment. Savar also expressed a general dislike for dealing with bounty hunters. Skywalker felt through the Force that Savar regretted his order to arrest the Grand Master, but Savar never showed it physically; his first loyalty was to duty and following the orders he was given. After Horn's capture, Savar also showed that he was open to compromise; though at first he demanded that Horn be handed over to the Security troops, he later agreed to Leia Organa Solo's proposal that Horn be put in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center, a secure facility about halfway between Jedi and Security jurisdictions. He was considered by many to be an intelligent leader, although his fellow Security captain, Oric Harfard, believed he was soft.\nSavar was created by Star Wars author Aaron Allston for his first novel in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Outcast, released on March 24, 2009.",
