 "content": "Tret was a male Sullustan who lived during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nIn c. 31 BBY, Tret accompanied a number of tourists that were visiting the droid production plants on the moon Uffel, in the Cularin system. During the trip, Tret and some of the other tourists, the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera, and Philinda, and the Rodian Nikolo, were recruited by the droid LN-73 into assisting him at sabotaging the production facilities. LN-73 accomplished this by lying to them by claiming that HG-211, Uffel's head of security, had been corrupted. Tret and the rest of the group then attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who LN-73 falsely claimed were sabotaging the droid factories.",
