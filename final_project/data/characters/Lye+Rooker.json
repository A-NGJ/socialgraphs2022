 "content": "Lye Rooker was a Human male living on the planet Coruscant. He served as a police officer with the Coruscant Police Force where he held the rank of captain.\nLye Rooker was a Human male originally from the planet of Ord Mantell. He later lived on the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant where he became police officer. Rooker eventually attained the rank of captain in the Coruscant Police Force. At some point, Rooker obtained a generous loan from the InterGalactic Banking Clan. However, he defaulted on the loan causing the Banking Clan to issue a bounty on Rooker through the owner of the Jetters Bar. They offered 3,000 credits for him alive and 1,500 for him dead.\nIn 32 BBY, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett tracked down Rooker in Coruscant's Financial District and collected on the reward.\nRooker was a Human male with light skin. When on duty, he wore his CSF uniform and carried a blaster.\nLye Rooker first appeared in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter a single player game released on December 5, 2002. The player can choose to pursue Ryko's bounty though it is not required to move to the next level. The player can also choose to capture Ryko alive or to kill him. He also had an entry in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide which was published on November 26, 2002.",
