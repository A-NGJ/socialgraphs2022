 "content": "Ter-Doac Vaine was a male Dark Jedi.\nIn 1 ABY, it was discovered that Ter-Doac had been mind-controlling Garrick Orion and Jonas Nova in an attempt to cause a rift in the Nova Orion Industries. Ter-Doac's goal was to get Nova Orion Station to build weapons for his campaign to take control of the renegade Imperial Star Destroyer in the Bright Jewel system.\nTer-Doac Vaine appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. His physical appearance could be seen briefly when he threatened a spacer via comm channel. The game files reveal that his right hand was cybernetic, however as his hand was not seen during normal gameplay, the canonicity of this attribute is ambigious.",
