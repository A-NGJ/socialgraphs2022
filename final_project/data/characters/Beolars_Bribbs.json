 "content": "Beolars Bribbs was a Sullustan male who served as President of the Sullustan Council, CEO of SoroSuub Corporation and Senator of Sullust.\nIn 22 BBY, Bribbs was elected shortly after Sullust and its de facto corporation-cum-government body, SoroSuub, aligned itself with the growing Separatist movement through its connections to the Commerce Guild. In his inaugural speech, standing beside Guild Presidente Shu Mai, Bribbs outlined his platform of guiding Sullust through the rocky pre-war days on his framing of Sullustan value: \"Hard work, persistence, and the cherishing of family is the Sullustan brand identity.\" He supported the controversial doubling of SoroSuub shareholder votes in future Sullustan elections, which presumably led to SoroSuub taking over the Sullustan Council.\nAt some point during the Imperial period, Beolars Bribbs, in addition to his becoming CEO of SoroSuub, also worked with the Incom Corporation, where he had aided in the development of the X-34 landspeeder and the T-65 X-wing starfighter, respectively, acting as the Chief Architect of both designs.\nHis name is also spelled \"Beolar Bribbs\".",
