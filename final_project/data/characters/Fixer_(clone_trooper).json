 "content": "\"Fixer\" was the nickname of a Clone cold assault trooper who served in the Devil Dogs of the 44th Special Operations Division of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Battle of Khorm around 22 BBY, Fixer and his fellow brother Jark were assigned to Jedi Generals Plo Koon and Kit Fisto, who were planning to destroy the local Weather-control station, and helped them bury several native Khormai killed by CIS battle droids. Later, the group was ambushed by Asajj Ventress and BX-series droid commandos, and Fixer was one of the few clones who survived the ambush. After the group finally reached the Weather-control station, Fixer sliced into the junction box and changed the coordinates for the upcoming artificial storm, directing it at the station itself. The station was destroyed and mission's objective was achieved.",
