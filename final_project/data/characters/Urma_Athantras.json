 "content": "Urma Athantras was an Arkanian female who served as a consular during the Imperial Era. Alongside Tione Zrar and Velai, Athantras attempted to protect a village led by Thissa Somori from a group of pirates. When the pirates landed to collect payments from the villagers, Athantras and her companions stood in their way, bringing the villagers into diplomatic negotiations with the pirates. While the pirates were unwilling to work with the villagers, the consulars managed to arrange a mutually beneficial agreement. Athantras wielded a staff, the end of which could be ignited into a lightsaber blade.",
