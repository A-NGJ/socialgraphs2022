 "content": "Mioe was a female Human who worked in Starwind Chandlery, a general store and starship outfitter that was located on StarForge Station, a space station in the StarForge Nebula. While the Devaronian Labio managed Starwind Chandlery, Mioe and the Wookiee Wurrooba clerked the store in 0 ABY. Mioe was small-sized for a Human.\nMioe first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit.",
