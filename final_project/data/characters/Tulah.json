 "content": "Tulah was a male Muun who was a member of a squad of young mercenaries that trained at the elite Leadership School on Andara during the final years of the Galactic Republic before the Clone Wars.\nTall and skinny, with a shock of bright yellow hair that stuck straight up from his head, Tulah was in charge of formulating the group's strategies and battle plans. His voice and demeanor were described as \"all business,\" and his own confession to being the squad's \"comic relief\" was simply a tongue-in-cheek expression that masked his serious purpose.",
