 "content": "A human pilot served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the human piloted a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft with four Pathfinders led by Sergeant Kes Dameron on an unsanctioned mission to rescue Dameron's wife Shara Bey from the Imperial Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will. As they traveled through hyperspace with Starlight Squadron, the ship received a message from Alliance Command and the pilot informed Dameron. Dameron told the pilot to not answer the message as they would just be ordered to return to the rebel fleet, and the pilot complied.\nShortly after, the team arrived at the location of the Tarkin's Will and as Starlight Squadron engaged the Star Destroyer's TIE fighters, the pilot flew the U-wing into a damaged area of the Tarkin's Will and dropped off Dameron and his companions so they could infiltrate the ship and rescue Bey. As the TIEs and Starlight Squadron continued their engagement, the Tarkin's Will suddenly powered up its engines and went into hyperspace with Dameron and his Pathfinders still aboard. After it had departed, the pilot noted the Star Destroyer must have been in a hurry as it had not recalled it's TIEs and informed Wedge Antilles of the fact that it had just taken the Pathfinders with it.",
