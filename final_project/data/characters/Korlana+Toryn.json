 "content": "Korlana Toryn was a Human woman who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. She was the daughter of Senator Jasso Toryn.\nWhen Toryn was a child, she became close to Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk, a good friend of her father. She called him \"Uncle Lanni\" and thought of him as almost being a second father to her. When the Cularin system disappeared from the galaxy for ten years, between 31 BBY and 21 BBY, Toryn became very upset, as it meant that she could not contact Qel-Bertuk.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Toryn was sent by her father to stay on the moon Nar Shaddaa, which was neutral in the conflict. He hired the heroes of Cularin to protect her, while she was there. After she arrived on Nar Shaddaa, she stayed at the hotel Bespin's Cloud and the heroes planned to meet her there. However, she left to visited Totor's Party Kave, a sail barge that was used as a nightclub. The heroes met with her there, but the barge was attacked and destroyed by a group of bounty hunters, who wanted to collect a bounty that had been posted on the heroes.\nA short time later, the bounty hunters captured Toryn and the heroes. However, the heroes were able to escape and they freed Toryn. The heroes then flew with Toryn to the Cularin system, where she went to stay under the protection of Master Qel-Bertuk and the Jedi Order.",
