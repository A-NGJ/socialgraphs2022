 "content": "Carid Tamb was a human male who served as a junior officer in the First Order during the First Order-Resistance War. Recruited from a conquered planet, he gained experience through combat simulations and became a technician. He served on the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast in the Battle of Exegol around 35 ABY.\nCarid Tamb was a human male brought to the First Order from a conquered world and, like many such recruits, became a junior officer and was assigned to fleet operations. Star Destroyer control stations were crewed by Tamb and other young and impressionable technicians, often under the command of Imperial veterans. During the war against the Resistance, junior officers such as Tamb gained experience through vivid combat simulations.\nIn 35 ABY, Tamb served on the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast. He was present on the ship during the Battle of Exegol against the Resistance, during which he interacted with the buttons of a monitor as the Citizens' Fleet arrived. The battle ended with the Steadfast's destruction and the defeat of the First Order.\nCarid Tamb had light skin and brown hair and eyes.\nTamb had experience which he had gained through combat simulations.\nTamb donned a black First Order military uniform along with black boots. He also wore a device on his left ear that routed internal communications through a shielded physical network.\nCarid Tamb first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. He was identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary by Pablo Hidalgo.",
