 "content": "Major Tso was a Human male who commanded the Galactic Republic's Viridian Squad during the Galactic War. Following the Battle of Rishi, he was part of Satele Shan's force that traveled to Yavin 4 and established the anti-Revanite Yavin Coalition along with forces of the reconstituted Sith Empire under Darth Marr. During an excursion into Massassi territory, the squad was ambushed, with Sergeant Era Jung killed and the rest taken captive. After a fellow Coalition member rescued the prisoners, they informed Major Tso of Sergeant Jung's death.\nMajor Tso appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
