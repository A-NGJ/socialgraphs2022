 "content": "After the fall of the Galactic Republic, the former Jedi Master Eeth Koth fathered a daughter during the Imperial Era. The Zabrak female was born to Koth and his wife, Mira. Immediately following the girl's birth, Koth was discovered by the Sith Lord Darth Vader and killed in a duel. With her father dead, the child was taken by Vader to the planet Coruscant and placed into the care of Sith nursemaids.\nThis infant was born to Eeth Koth and his wife, Mira, on an Unidentified planet. As soon as the baby was born, Koth was eager to hold her, but before he could, Darth Vader, who had been searching for Koth with the assistance of the Inquisitorius, appeared. Koth ordered Mira to take their baby and run. Mira almost made it to her father's transport when a red-skinned Inquisitor named Iskat appeared. Mira begged her not to take her baby. Iskat pretended to let them go. Mira and her child boarded her father's ship, but as they ascended the Inquisitor used the Force to take the baby out of Mira's hands.\nIskat brought the baby to Vader, who was in a lightsaber duel with her father. Koth saw the baby in the Inquisitor's hands and was killed from a slash in the back as Vader used the window of opportunity to force his advantage. The baby was given to Vader and continued crying in his hands before he used the Force to silence it. The group then took their Zeta-class shuttle back to Coruscant where the baby was given to two nursemaids to be put into Project Harvester. As the nursemaids took her, they exclaimed its prettiness in a manner that The Grand Inquisitor found worrying.\nShe had black eyes and light skin.\nLike her father, Eeth Koth's daughter was Force-sensitive and had the potential to connect to the Force.\nEeth Koth's daughter first appeared in Darth Vader  19, a 2018 canon comic written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli.",
