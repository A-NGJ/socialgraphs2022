 "content": "Uri-Los was an A'Mar, the Human settlers of Lamus. He was not eligible to participate in the Vigil as he had already drunk the waters from the Wellspring. He took part in the Beastlord's Hunt when his party was attacked by a Brachian Beastlord. His companion Jeg was poisoned by the beast and together they went to the Wellspring to seek help from the offworlders protecting it at that time.",
