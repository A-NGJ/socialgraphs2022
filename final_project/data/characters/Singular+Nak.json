He lied to this individual, telling them that she had in fact stole the lightsaber from him. Once the individual had killed her and brought the lightsaber back to him, he told them the truth.\nSingular Nak was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
