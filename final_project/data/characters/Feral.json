 "content": "Feral was a male Dathomirian Zabrak Nightbrother who lived during the Clone Wars. He was the younger brother of Savage Opress and Maul, and a son of Mother Talzin. Feral was among those chosen by Nightsister Asajj Ventress to become her chosen champion in her campaign of vengeance against her former master, Count Dooku. Feral survived the tests, but Savage was chosen as the champion. Soon thereafter, Savage was made to kill Feral to prove his loyalty to Ventress.\nFeral was born as a Nightbrother of Dathomir, and the brother of Savage Opress and Maul. Feral and Savage went through rituals to become Nightbrothers.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Nightsister Asajj Ventress visited the Nightbrothers to find a champion, one who could be given advanced strength and power through magic to aid her in her quest for vengeance against her former master, Count Dooku. A number of Nightbrothers were chosen to participate in the tests designed to find Ventress' champion.\nWith Savage's help, Feral survived all three tests. Savage pleaded for mercy for his brother, and Feral was spared despite failing in the final challenge. Savage became the champion and was taken by Ventress and given enhanced strength and power, enough to rival that of a Jedi Knight. Shortly thereafter, Feral was taken prisoner by the Nightsisters and brought before his brother so Savage could kill him as a test of loyalty and strength. Feral tried to appeal to Savage's love for him, but his brother's mind had become twisted by the Nightsister magic. Savage, disgusted by Feral's weakness, ignored the pleas. At Ventress' command, and with only a moment's hesitation, Savage grabbed Feral and used his newfound strength to break Feral's neck, snuffing out his brother's life and passing his final test.\nFeral was reckless and arrogant, often shrugging off Savage's warnings, believing himself to be a vigilant warrior. However, he quickly learned of his combat faults in his first fight against Asajj Ventress. During the Selection, Savage was able to repeatedly protect Feral, but Feral's reliance on Savage would be his undoing as he was killed by Savage's bare hands after his display of weakness.\nFeral first appeared in \"Monster,\" the thirteenth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' third season.",
