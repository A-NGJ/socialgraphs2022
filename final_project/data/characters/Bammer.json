 "content": "Bammer was the nickname of a clone trooper who served the Grand Army of the Republic as a pilot of Gold Squadron during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 21 BBY, he served alongside Jedi General Anakin Skywalker when they were tasked to destroy a Separatist ship during the Battle of Lanteeb. However, the Separatist ship was hijacked by General Grievous which gave him enough time to escape and fly to safety. After a short pursuit, Bammer was hit unexpectedly by a volley of lasers that destroyed his starfighter, which killed him.",
