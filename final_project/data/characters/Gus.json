 "content": "\"Gus\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He participated in the Battle of Christophsis as a member of Clone Sergeant Slick's squad.\nDuring a battle on Christophsis, Gus and the rest of his squad were setting up for ambush on the droid army from a tower with Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Commander Cody. Gus then spotted the battle droids bring up AATs and were splitting up. The battle droids then stormed the tower and Gus was wounded. They were then saved by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Clone Captain Rex, and their men before retreating to the rooftop. Before being picked up by Hawk's gunship, Gus then took TJ-55's head back with him.\nGus and the rest of platoon were called to their barracks by Cody and Rex for questioning if someone among them were a spy, much to Sergeant Slick's chagrin. Gus then told them he was being treated for his wound after the ambush and that the medical droid would have the records. He then ganged on up on Chopper when he lied about his whereabouts. However, Slick was revealed to be the true spy and escaped. Gus and the others then went to the base's weapons depot and spotted Slick going into the command center after blowing up the depot.",
