 "content": "Bekhaj was a male Evocii who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nDuring the war, he worked as a merchant on the planet Nal Hutta, the homeworld of his species previously known as Evocar, but taken over and renamed by the Hutt species who adopted it as their homeworld. Whilst at the stall the Evocii wore a piece of head-wear which revealed the top of his head as well as brown clothing. Bekhaj had pale yellow skin, blue eyes and was bald.\nBekhaj first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He appears as a stims vendor on the planet Nal Hutta, the starting planet for players of the bounty hunter and Imperial Agent class.",
