 "content": "Shai Tenna was a male Weequay who was the leader of a group belonging to the White Maw pirates, during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3642 BBY, during the Galactic War, Tenna was sent to Hoth by Rogun the Butcher to take over the White Maw pirate gang. At the same time, the smuggler later known as the Voidhound, working as a privateer for the Galactic Republic, arrived on the frozen planet in search of a cloaking device that enabled the White Maw to hide their ships.\nTenna's lackey Languss Tuno set up a meeting between his superior and the Voidhound, the latter seeking to join the White Maw. Tenna told the smuggler that they need to perform a task for him before he inducts them. His rival, Kandhar, was dealing with Imperials to acquire cold-weather droids and blasters to gain favor with the White Maw's Gen'Dai leaders. Tenna left the details on how to accomplish this to his slave, Alilia.\nAfter the Voidhound accomplished this task by turning Kandhar's own men against him, Tenna reneged on their deal and threw the smuggler into a wampa cave and began a coup against the White Maw.\nTenna later confronted the Voidhound in the wreckage of the Star of Coruscant, after having captured the turncoat Tuno. The smuggler had discovered that the cloaking device was actually a mentally-impaired Force-sensitive Kitonak known as Trick. Tenna and his men attacked the Voidhound but the gangster was killed in the fight.",
