 "content": "Twin was a young female Cerean and the girlfriend of Skeel. After the death of Skeel, Twin went directly to Maj-Odo-Nomor, who fell for Twin's charms.\nIn 33 BBY, Twin supported a movement by Bron and stood up for the development of advanced technologies on Cerea. She and her friend Skeel joined the Techrats and went on a dangerous race they fought out within the Outsider Citadel.\nAfter Skeel crashed and died in the swoop race, Twin sought affection from Maj. Twin and her close friend Sylvn were once captured by Jabba the Hutt, and suffered the humiliation and disgust of serving as his slave girls. She and Sylvn were later rescued by Sylvn's father, Jedi Ki-Adi-Mundi, during a lightning storm, in which the Hutt tried to execute them.",
