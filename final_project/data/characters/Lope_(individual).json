 "content": "Lope was a Human male who was described as being large and muscular enough to be a smashball player. He was a veteran of the Stark Hyperspace War. After the war, he became a mercenary; his specialty was melee weapons, although he was equally proficient at both short-range and sniper blaster usage.\nAfter he became wanted for murder on Sacorria, Lope stayed out of the Core Worlds, working along the Corellian Trade Spine, eventually winding up on Karfeddion around 33 BBY. There, Arwen Cohl hired him to participate in the Nebula Front attack on the Eriadu Trade Summit, where, after a brief struggle with Qui-Gon Jinn, he was captured.",
