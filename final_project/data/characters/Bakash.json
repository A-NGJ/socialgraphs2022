 "content": "Bakash was a male Human who served as a colonel in the Imperial Army of the Sith Empire during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. In 3643 BBY, Bakash and the men he commanded were stationed on the Sith world of Korriban where they were sent to the Lower Wilds region. There they were driven mad by an unknown force and became hostile to their former allies. Bakash was killed, along with his men by a Sith apprentice who was sent to wipe out the insane soldiers.",
