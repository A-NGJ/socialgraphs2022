 "content": "Snoo was a Devaronian male who worked as an information broker around the time of the Galactic Civil War. At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Snoo was present at the Rii Jenks Cantina on the planet Formos. There, he encountered a group of off-world individuals who had been hired to recover the droid R4-W9, which had been stolen by the Aqualish smuggler Bandin Dobah. In return for a small fee, Snoo agreed to provide the off-worlders with information regarding Dobah and his activities.",
