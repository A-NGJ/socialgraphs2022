 "content": "A Klatooinian was captain of a freighter belonging to Noggox the Hutt during the Clone Wars.\nA male brown-skinned Klatooinian was captain of a freighter. The freighter was owned by Noggox the Hutt. In 21 BBY, the ship was carrying droid brains to the Fondor Shipyards when it was intercepted near Shipwrights' Trace by a pirate ship. The pirate Dool Pundar contacted the Captain and ordered his surrender and sent B1-Series battle droids to capture the freighter, though the Captain warned him that the ship was owned by Noggox. Pundar allowed the crew to take refuge in an escape pod. As Pundar absconded with their freighter a lieutenant voiced his concerns to the Captain, who ordered him to transmit a distress signal to Coruscant. He and the crew were later recovered safely.\nThe Captain appears in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies, a comic tie-in to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions series.",
