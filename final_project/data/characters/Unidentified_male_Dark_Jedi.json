 "content": "A male Dark Jedi was a Human who was sensitive to the Force, having fallen to the dark side. He served the forces of the Galactic Empire, and commanded at least one stormtrooper. At some point during his career, the Dark Jedi gave into his anger and murdered one of his subordinate soldiers with his lightsaber. The man was light-skinned and had black hair, and also wore blue clothing with a hooded cloak. He used a lightsaber with a yellow crystal.\nThe male Dark Jedi appeared in an image created for the Jedi Academy Training Manual, a resource guide for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. He was drawn by Francis Tsai.",
