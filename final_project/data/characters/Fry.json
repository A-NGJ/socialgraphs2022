 "content": "Fry was a human female Councilor aboard the Galactic Republic prison ship Restitution during the High Republic Era. She worked alongside Councilor Jon Wittick, and was often more hostile toward the Restitution's prisoners than her counterpart. After a number of Nihil marauders captured by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order at the Battle of Galov were transferred to the Restitution, Fry and Wittick oversaw their arrival. The Nihil included Tempest Runner Lourna Dee, who had managed to escape the Republic's notice and took a false name, with whom Fry conflicted on various occasions.\nDee's presence aboard the Restitution eventually led her rival, former Tempest Runner Pan Eyta, to attack the vessel. Fry, Wittick, and several prisoners, including Dee herself, survived the initial assault, and were forced to work together against the attackers. When the group came under attack from Nihil scav droids, Fry lost an arm and received a severe stomach wound. The group attempted to escape from the approaching droids through a maintenance shaft, but Fry did not have the strength to make it through. Fry instead chose to stay behind, sacrificing herself to slow down the droids.\nFry was voiced by Kathleen McInerney in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott.",
