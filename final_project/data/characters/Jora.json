 "content": "Jora was a male Rodian big game hunter who worked for the Nar Shaddaa-based Hutt crime lord Sinasu, as Sinasu's chief local leader on the planet Tatooine. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Jora captured some Krayt dragon eggs and a small Krayt dragon at Sinasu's request and transported them to the outpost Vapor Station, where he prepared them for shipping to Nar Shaddaa by a group of individuals that were indebted to the Sinasu. However, just as Jora finished briefing the agents for their upcoming mission, the outpost was raided by a band of Tusken Raiders. Jora opened fire on the Tuskens with his blaster and directed some of his henchmen to attack the raiders.",
