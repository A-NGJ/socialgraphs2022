 "content": "Ika Sulko was a Mon Calamari male pilot who flew an A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter for the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Starfighter Corps. His ability to operate within the fighter's rotatable cockpit was heightened due to his inherent kinesthetic sense. He wore a green flight suit and a helmet while in his B-wing, and he had orange eyes as well as brown mottle skin.\nIka Sulko was created for a scene in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, that was ultimately deleted. He was first pictured in the new Star Wars canon in issue 67 of De Agostini's Star Wars Helmet Collection magazine, published in 2018. He was then identified in the 2019 reference book Rebel Starfighters Owners' Workshop Manual, written by Ryder Windham. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Sulko was first mentioned outside of his deleted scene in his 2012 Hasbro action figure, released as part of the Star Wars: The Vintage Collection line.\nFootage of the scene was first revealed in a trailer for the Star Wars: The Complete Saga box set at Comic-Con International in 2011. In the scene, Sulko says several lines as they are given to Tim Rose, the puppeteer for Admiral Gial Ackbar in the film. Many of the lines were given to other rebel pilots whose roles were cut as well, including a Sullustan and a human. Among others, the lines included mentioning that he was in range, that he was losing power, as well as a warning to stay clear, as a nearby starship was going to explode. Rose utilized the same puppet that was used to film closeup shots for Sulko on the face of Admiral Ackbar.",
