 "content": "CT-915 was a clone trooper who fought in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars along with fellow trooper CT-914. Raised and trained together on the planet Kamino, the two troopers shared a close bond, viewing each other as brothers. In 20 BBY, both served during the Battle of Drongar, in which CT-915 was killed. His death left CT-914 grief-stricken for the rest of his days, until the latter was also killed shortly thereafter in the same battle.\nCT-915 was one of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett that were produced on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. CT-915 was decanted just after fellow clone CT-914; the two trained together and eventually developed a brother-like bond. When the Clone Wars broke out, CT-914 and CT-915 fought side-by-side as clone troopers for the Galactic Republic. In 20 BBY, they were posted on the planet Drongar, where the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems fought for control of the valuable bota plant fields; bota possessed great medicinal qualities. Once again, the two friends were inseparable, as they were assigned to the same cohort.\nDuring one of the engagements on the planet, CT-915 was gravely injured and was brought to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 to receive help; CT-914 helped transport his comrade there. The surgeons of the RMSU fought for Nine-one-five's life for an entire day, while CT-914 waited for the results outside the surgery. However, the doctors were unable to save the clone's life, and CT-915 died. When CT-914 learned of his best friend's death from Doctor Jos Vondar, the trooper was stricken with grief, although he tried not to show it. CT-914 mourned for his fallen comrade, until he also met his end on Drongar in a Confederate ambush.\nLike all clone troopers, CT-915 stood 1.83 meters tall. Having known each other for their entire lives, CT-915 and CT-914 trained, fought, and spent their off-hours together. Although all clone troopers were, in a sense, brothers, as they were copies of Jango Fett, Nine-one-five and Nine-one-four were especially close. CT-914 thought of Nine-one-five as a good and skilled soldier and was deeply saddened by the loss of his best friend.\nCT-915 was created by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry for the 2004 MedStar Duology, consisting of MedStar I: Battle Surgeons and MedStar II: Jedi Healer. Nine-one-five did not physically appear in the books, but was rather only mentioned. In 2008, he received a brief entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
