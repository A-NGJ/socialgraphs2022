 "content": "A human male villager resided in the Tatooinian town of Mos Pelgo during the New Republic era. Following the Galactic Civil War, he bore witness to a feud between the people of his village and a group of indigenous Tusken Raiders. Around the year 9 ABY, these tensions came to a head when Mos Pelgo's marshal, Cobb Vanth, brokered a truce between the villagers and the Tuskens in order to band together and kill a krayt dragon that plagued both groups. The villager voiced his repulsion to the idea, angered that the Tuskens had raided the small town's mines in the past.\nLater, while loading explosive devices onto the Raiders' bantha mounts, the villager entered into an altercation with a Tusken, who accidentally dropped one of the charges. At the behest of Vanth, however, the man dropped the subject. Together, the two groups were eventually able to take down the dragon with the help of the Mandalorian Din Djarin.\nThe villager appeared in the second season premiere of the 2019 television series The Mandalorian, which aired on October 30, 2020 on Disney+. He was portrayed by Dieterich Gray.",
