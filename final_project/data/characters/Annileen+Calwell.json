 "content": "Annileen Calwell,  nicknamed Annie, was a female Human storekeeper who lived in Dannar's Claim, in the Pika Oasis. The widow of Dannar Calwell, she was also the mother of Kallie and Jabe, and a friend of Leelee Pace. She did not like her teenage son Jabe hanging around with Orrin Gault and his posse as she feared he would get injured or killed by Tusken Raiders.\nAfter Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi delivered Luke Skywalker to his uncle Owen Lars and his wife, he settled down close to where Annileen was dutifully running Dannar's Claim, a general store her late husband left in the Pika Oasis. Kenobi's oddity intrigued her initially. Through brief but eventful interactions, she developed feelings for Kenobi. However, after a showdown involving Orrin's posse, she found her position in the oasis untenable due to her perceived connection with Orrin, who had embezzled the oasis.\nThough she had hoped her future would involve Obi-wan, he prepared Annileen and her family to leave Tatooine immediately. She learned that her old college application was mysteriously accepted by the University of Alderaan, which was a dream of her younger years.",
