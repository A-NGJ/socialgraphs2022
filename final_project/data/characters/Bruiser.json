 "content": "Bruiser was a Human male criminal who lived during the final years of the Galactic Republic.\nA prisoner exiled to Kiffex, he was hired by Gorto Zaga to defend the local settlement's walls against the attacking Anzati. His standing orders were to shoot anyone who tried to enter at night; as a result, he attempted to kill the Devaronian Vilmarh Grahrk and his Jedi companions. After entering the city, Tholme used a mind trick, causing Bruiser to forget the affair entirely.",
