 "content": "Ormann Bomu was a male Rodian of the Bomu Clan. Along with his brother he worked for Zonnos of the Anjiliac kajidic. Onboard the light freighter Vengeance, they led raiding parties against enemy ships.\nIn typical Hutt fashion, there was much infighting in the Anjiliac kajidic. Heedron were dispatched by Zonnos to prevent the rescue of his brother Mika from Endregaad. The rescue was instigated by Zonnos' parent Popara, and was more than the pair could handle. In the ensuing firefight, it is believed that Ormann was killed and Heedron handed over to the Corporate Sector Authority.\nThe rescuers found two more Bomus on Endregaad when returning to their ships, wanting to \"finish the job\". It is unclear if they were Heedron and Ormann, or if they were their relatives, Gespo and Hreeda Bomu, looking for revenge.",
