 "content": "Deidre Jocund was a female human who served in the Thaereian military during the Clone Wars.\nJocund was a member of a squad under the command of Lorwin Derlynn and she was the squad's medic. During the Clone Wars, she and the rest of her squad were sent to occupy an abandoned Cularin Militia base in the Cularin system asteroid belt. The Heroes of Cularin arrived there, intending to deliver supplies to the Militia, so the squad tried to make them surrender to them. However, the heroes tried to convince Jocund and her comrades to defect to the Militia instead.\nJocund respected Lorwin Derlynn, but believed that he should indulge in a bit more critical thinking, as she was beginning to doubt the truthfulness of the things they were being told by their Thaereian superiors.",
