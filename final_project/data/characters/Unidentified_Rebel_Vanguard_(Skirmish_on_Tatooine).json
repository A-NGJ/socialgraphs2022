 "content": "The unidentified Rebel Vanguard was a male Human who joined the Rebel Alliance and became a member of the Rebel vanguard division. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin he accompanied Admiral Ackbar on a scouting mission to Boz Pity to look for a new base for the Alliance. After serving at Boz Pity, the Mon Calamarian took a small party with him to go look at Saleucami, the Vanguard included. Saleucami was another possible location for a new base. They never made it.\nWhile on their way to the planet, their starship was attacked and boarded by the infamous bounty hunter, Boba Fett. The Vanguard survived the attack but was captured by the Mandalorian. He and the rest of the scout party, minus Ackbar who was sold to the Galactic Empire, were sold to the Hutt Cartel on Tatooine as slaves. During the Mission to Mos Eisley, he and the other rebel prisoners were freed by General Han Solo and Renegade Squadron.",
