 "content": "Gar Bettle was a Gungan male who lived on Cularin during the Clone Wars.\nBettle owned Hedrett Holovid, a holovid rental shop. One of his most regular customers was Nek Lawsirk, a Zabrak Jedi Knight, who was a fan of Jedi Action holovids. Bettle disliked Jedi Action vids and tried to persuade Lawsirk to watch something different, but the Zabrak refused to listen. When Lawsirk went missing, the Heroes of Cularin spoke to Bettle during the course of their investigations to find the absent knight.",
