 "content": "Yve was a Filordus who worked as an independent pilot during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Yve was a genderless individual who was referred to by the male Osten Dal'Nay with the pronoun \"it.\"\nDuring the Clone Wars, Yve was hired by the Cularin Militia to escort the Heroes of Cularin, a group of Militia-allied freelance agents, from the Cularin system to the planet Caarimon, in the Meridian sector. On arrival on Caarimon, the agents discovered a Z-95 Headhunter on landing platform A-12 in the city Joventusek, which had been left there by the Shistavanen Blik, and Yve remained with the craft while the agent searched Caarimon for a team of Believers. However, soon afterward Blik recovered his starship, and Yve and the Shistavanen susbequently engaged in a starfighter dogfight near to Caarimon.\nYve was created Morrie Mullins and featured in Belly of the Beaast, a roleplaying adventure that formed part of the Metatheran Caution trilogy of the Living Force campaign. During the adventure, the players role-play as the Heroes of Cularin and they have the option of accepting an offer from the Cularin Militia to have Yve accompany them to Caarimon.",
