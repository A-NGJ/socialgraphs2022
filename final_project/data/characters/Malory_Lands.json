 "content": "Malory Lands was the cousin of Roan Lands, one of the founding members of the resistance group The Eleven on Bellassa. She was the daughter of Roan's Aunt Lilia. Malory was a med student at ChanPal on Coruscant until the Empire took control renaming it Emperor's Reconstructive Surgical Center, and she returned to her home world of Bellassa. It was there that she reunited with her cousin's best friend and husband, Ferus Olin at the Nine Days of Mourning being held for Roan. It was at this meeting that Ferus Olin asked her to return to her former school in an attempt to uncover information about the true identity of his nemisis, Darth Vader, in effect enrolling her in the ranks of The Eleven.",
