 "content": "Twool was a young Rodian apprentice in Luke Skywalker's Jedi order, five years after the peace treaty between the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong.\nTwool was assigned to introduce Cal Omas and Chiss Aristocra Mitt'swe'kleoni to the Jedi Masters during a Masters' Council meeting in the new Jedi Temple. However, Luke Skywalker sensed the presence of his visitors, and opened the door to a surprised Twool. Skywalker shooed Twool from the chamber as the Chief of State and the Aristocra entered. Later Luke asked Twool to bring Jacen Solo to him so they could talk.\nDuring the Second Galactic Civil War, Twool was a full-fledged Jedi Knight. He flew several missions in a StealthX and was tasked with using his starfighter's special sensors to monitor Jacen Solo. Later, Twool would fly in Rakehell Squadron under the command of Wedge Antilles. Twool was killed when the Rakehells squared off against Rogue Squadron.",
