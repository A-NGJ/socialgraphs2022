 "content": "Mika Horn was a Human male who served as a soldier in the army of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Sergeant Mika Horn served as a trooper in the army of the Rebel Alliance. He used to wear a Rebel battle armor.\nIn 1 ABY, an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nThe Rebel Alliance quickly discovered the accident on Dathomir and dispatched a small unit of Rebel troops to investigate the Imperial Research and Prison Facility and rescue survivors. However, the Rebel forces were soon attacked by undead stormtroopers and suffered heavy casualties. When some Rebel soldiers started to display symptoms of the sickness, the evacuation missions were aborted and the few remaining Rebels were stuck in the Quarantine Zone. Mika Horn eventually took shelter in Camp Alpha, along with the TIE pilot Jeb Maris and the Bothan Oona Wran. Sergeant Mika Horn was in charge of the forward defense of the camp and used to recruit spacers who ventured into the Quarantine Zone to help him in that mission.\nMika Horn was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mika Horn was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
