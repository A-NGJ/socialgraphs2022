 "content": "Seeral Korrd was a Human male who served as a colonel in the Imperial Army of the reconstitute Sith Empire.\nSeeral Korrd was born shortly before the Battle of Korriban and the start of the Great Galactic War in 3681 BBY. Both of Korrd's parents were high-ranking and respected members of the Imperial Navy, which guaranteed his admittance into prestigious Imperial military academies.\nIn 3665 BBY, Korrd's older brother Harkas Korrd was killed during the Battle of Hoth, an event which devastated Korrd and prompted him to request transfer out of his specialized combat program so that he could study coordinating and transferring supplies. Due to his age and reputation, Korrd was transferred to a quiet outpost on Dromund Kaas.\nDuring the Reconquest of Ord Radama, Korrd bore witness to the cost of running an extensive campaign with limited provisions and he vowed to keep soldiers from fighting in such conditions.",
