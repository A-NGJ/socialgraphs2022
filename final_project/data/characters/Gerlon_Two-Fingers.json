 "content": "Gerlon Two-Fingers was a male Human who was at one point considered one of the greatest duelists in the Taris dueling ring.\nGerlon was a veteran duelist in the Taris dueling ring. He quickly rose through the ranks, gaining more skill every day. After a tragic accident where Gerlon's blaster overheated during a match and exploded and paralyzed three fingers on his right hand, he earned the name Gerlon Two-Fingers. Marl described this incident as a \"one in a million occurrence\". After the injury, he slowly lost his high standings in the ring, until the only person he was able to beat was Deadeye Duncan, the weakest duelist. Gerlon remained quite bitter about the accident and frequently claimed that he could have beaten most other duelists if he still had his digits. Ajuur, the owner of the arena, eventually began using him simply to soften up opponents for later battles.\nIn 3956 BBY, Revan, under the alias of \"the Mysterious Stranger\", defeated him in a broadcast duel.\nGerlon's first canonical appearance is as a non-player character in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game. Inside the game, the player, Revan, can choose to fight him in the dueling ring. However, the nature of the encounter is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with him.",
