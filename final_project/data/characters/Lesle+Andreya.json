 "content": "Lesle Andreya was a Human female from the planet Neree.\nLesle Andreya served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as an agent for Alliance Intelligence under the leadership of General Airen Cracken during the Galactic Civil War. She was trained by the Rebellion's best espionage experts and knew all the \"by the book\" tricks. She was known to have been one of the top agents of her time, with information provided by Andreya allowing Alliance forces to avoid Imperial ambushes. However, around 7 ABY, Andreya's loyalties shifted and she began actively working against the Alliance's successor state, the New Republic.\nAndreya stole sensitive computer files containing defense plans and disappeared in the region surrounding Nal Hutta. The New Republic Intelligence Service believed that she obtained transport from there to an Imperial-controlled sector where they believed she was planning to sell the information to the highest bidder. The New Republic was curious as to her motives, cautioning agents looking for her that they would have to improvise given her knowledge of standard tactics. It was believed that she had family members in Mos Eisley; New Republic Intelligence indicated that beginning there was a good starting point for agents tracking her.\nAndreya hid her facial identity, and spoke with a trace of a Neree accent. She was not known to use violent means, relying instead on her persuasion skills.\nAndreya dressed in full body robes that concealed her features, and carried a hold-out blaster, knife, and fragmentation grenades.\nArt depicting Lesle Andreya in Wanted by Cracken was an unused concept for Princess Leia for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.",
