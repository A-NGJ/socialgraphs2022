 "content": "\"Kosmos\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. After the Battle of Malastare in 21 BBY, Kosmos was stationed on Coruscant when a Zillo Beast was brought to the Galactic Republic's capital. The beast was brought to a secure laboratory on the city-planet where Kosmos was part of the detail assigned to guard the facility. Shortly after, the Zillo Beast started to break free from the laboratory. Moments after mentioning the insignificance of their weapons in the situation, Kosmos and his comrades were killed by the beast.\nKosmos was a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett who was created on the planet Kamino and served the Grand Army of the Republic as a clone trooper. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, he was stationed on the Core Worlds planet Coruscant, the capital of the Republic. Kosmos was assigned to the security team for the Zillo Beast, a creature which had been transported to Coruscant for reasearch on its species, specifically its remarkably strong armor after the catastrophic Battle of Malastare, where the beast revealed itself following the Republic's use of a prototype electro-proton bomb.\nDespite the heavy security involved in the operation, the Zillo Beast managed to break free inside the laboratory where it was being studied. Kosmos and the rest of the security detail, which included numerous troopers and All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, readied for the Zillo Beast to escape as the alarms were triggered inside the facility. As Kosmos voiced his concerns about the clone troopers' standard-issue weapons against such an enemy—concerns that were quickly rejected by his comrades— the Zillo Beast burst out of the facility, smashing through the side of the building. As the massive wall crushed Kosmos and his comrades, the beast escaped from the facility. Although its rampage carried it all the way to the Senate Building, the beast was eventually stopped by the combined efforts of Coruscant security forces.\nAs a clone of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, Kosmos stood 1.83 meters tall. Among his fellow clones, Kosmos also displayed a more cautious attitude towards the threat of the Zillo Beast.\nKosmos wore a set of Phase I clone trooper armor and wielded a DC-15 blaster rifle while on Coruscant.\nKosmos appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back,\" which aired on April 16, 2010. Like all clone troopers in the series, Kosmos was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.",
