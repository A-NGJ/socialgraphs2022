 "content": "Lavek Talstin was a male Devaronian who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nWhen Talstin was young, his mother and aunts arranged for him to marry the Devaronian Shelta Sune. However, he considered Sune to be obnoxious and overbearing, so he left the planet where he lived, before the marriage could take place. Under Devaronian law, once Talstin married Sune, she would gain most of his income, so she didn't want to let him go and got her mother, aunts and sisters to send their husbands to find Talstin. Talstin purchased the Action VI transport Wanderer and operated as a trader for several years. However, after he encountered one of Sune's uncles in a warehouse, he escaped and realized that he could only be safe if he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nTalstin served the Alliance for several years, using his ship as a supply transport. He operated from the world Cuirilla.",
