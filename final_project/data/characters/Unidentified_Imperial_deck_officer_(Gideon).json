 "content": "A human male served as a deck officer in Moff Gideon's Galactic Empire remnant aboard Gideon's light cruiser at the rank of lieutenant. When the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle designated Shuttle 2743 was chased by the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I in 9 ABY, the deck officer helped clear the launch tube of the light cruiser by halting the launch of additional TIE fighters, allowing the shuttle to land in the hangar. Infiltrators aboard the vessel then exited and killed personnel in the hangar.\nThe deck officer served in a remnant of the Galactic Empire led by Moff Gideon, stationed aboard Gideon's light cruiser and holding the rank of lieutenant. In 9 ABY, a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle designated Shuttle 2743 was pursued by the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I. The light cruiser's hangar deployed two TIE fighters, but orders soon came from a comms officer stationed at the bridge to clear the launch tube for the shuttle to land.\nThe deck officer ordered hangar control to stand down through his comlink and halted a TIE which was getting ready to launch. The officer then watched Shuttle 2743 approach the launch tube, rushing out of the way when the shuttle landed into the hangar at high speed. From the vessel came an infiltration team consisting of Bo-Katan Kryze, Cara Dune, Fennec Shand, and Koska Reeves, killing everyone in their path.\nThe deck officer was a human male with light skin, dark hair and brown eyes. Upon orders to clear the launch tube, he moved hastily to halt the launch of TIE fighters.\nThe deck officer wore the wore the standard uniform of an Imperial naval officer, including an Imperial kepi and a code cylinders attached below his left shoulder, one of which he used to access his terminal. He wore a rank insignia plaque on his left breast with two red bars above two blue, which signified the rank of lieutenant. The officer possessed a comlink and a SE-14r light repeating blaster that was holstered on his right hip.\nThe deck officer first appeared in \"Chapter 16: The Rescue\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Peyton Reed and released on December 18, 2020. Identified as \"deck officer\" in the episode's audio description, he was played by Stephen Bralver.",
