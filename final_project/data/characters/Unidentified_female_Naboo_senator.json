 "content": "A female Human senator represented the planet Naboo—and presumably the Chommell sector—in the Galactic Senate of the Republic during the era of Great Peace. She was succeeded by Vidar Kim at some point between 65 and 54 BBY.\nThe female Naboo that would eventually become the representative for her homeworld started working her way up the political chain succeeding the former senator. The future senator, Sith Lord, Supreme Chancellor and Galactic Emperor Palpatine criticized her while living on Naboo in his younger years. Staying on for a few years, she was succeeded by Vidar Kim.",
