 "content": "Makna-Ha was a Voss Mystic living on Voss many years before the planet was discovered by the galactic society. His vision showed the need for a civil war between the Voss. As every vision was followed without question, a bloody conflict left thousands of Voss dead, but not Makna-Ha himself, who was devastated by his vision's result. Makna-Ha recorded his thoughts in the Writings of Makna-Ha on a carving outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths.",
