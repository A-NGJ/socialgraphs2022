 "content": "Lokann was a male Rutian Twi'lek who operated on the planet Coruscant in 19 BBY. He and his business partner brokered a deal with Rafa Martez, hiring the young woman to build them three binary loadlifters. After one of the Type II loadlifter droids went on a rampage through Level 1313, requiring Rafa's sister Trace and her new friend Ahsoka Tano to chase it down, Trace and Tano asked Rafa not to go through with the deal. However, in need of credits, Rafa instead charged Lokann double for the job.\nLokann's face was both light and dark blue. He had long fingernails and a scar across his mouth.\nLokann is a character created for the revival of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.",
