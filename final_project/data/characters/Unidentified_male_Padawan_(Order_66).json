 "content": "An individual was a Human male Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. At the time when Order 66 was executed by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, he was part of a group of eight padawans that fled the Jedi Temple's attack and were traveling across the Shinarcan Bridge Extension and attempting to pass through the checkpoint and escape Coruscant, but their chances failed when they were caught by the Grand Army of the Republic and Coruscant Security Force personnel, which led to a shootout. Just Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan, who was also passing through on her way to a join up with the rest of Clan Skirata for evacuation, stepped in front of the padawan, who panicked and struck her down by accident. Seconds soon, he was stabbed in the chest by Darman.",
