 "content": "Vince was a Human male who was alive during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war he worked as a merchant on the planet Nal Hutta, the adopted homeworld of Hutt species. On Hutta he owned a small stall in the market area of Jiguuna, an industrial town controlled by a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro. The stall consisted of a rack covered with the goods he sold, which consisted of various types of light armor. As all merchants in Jiguuna were, Vince was expected to pay some of his profits from his stall to one of Nem'ro's lieutenants at the crime lord's palace. Whilst at the stall the man wore grey colored clothing and a blaster pistol on his hip. He also owned a device capable of displaying a holographic screen of data which he often consulted whilst at the stall. Vince had red colored hair including a beard, blue eyes and pale skin.\nVince first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He appears as a light armor vendor on the planet Nal Hutta, the starting planet for players of the bounty hunter and Imperial Agent class.",
