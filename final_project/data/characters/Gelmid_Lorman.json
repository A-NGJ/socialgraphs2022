 "content": "Gelmid Lorman was a male Human of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nLorman was not known for his skill or talent, so he used his family's connections to eventually earn him the rank of Moff. In 3640 BBY, Lorman served as the deputy commander of the Ascendant Spear and the non-Sith right hand of the Dark Council Member, Darth Karrid. During the Battle of Duro, when all seemed lost, he ordered the evacuation of the ship. He was officially blamed for the ship's loss, but during the Eternal Empire's Conquest, his career was renewed and he had risen to become Minister of Logistics under Empress Darth Acina. During his career, Malavai Quinn defied his orders to cease his search for the missing Emperor's Wrath, so Lorman had him thrown into prison for his defiance. When the Outlander came to Dromund Kaas by Acina's invitation to discuss an alliance, Lorman secretly plotted with the former Supreme Chancellor Saresh to assassinate both the Empress and the Outlander as part of her coup to take over the Alliance. After his plot was failed and deception revealed, Acina allowed the Outlander to decide his fate.",
