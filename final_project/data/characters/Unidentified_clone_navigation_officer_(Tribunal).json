 "content": "A clone trooper officer served as a clone navigation officer aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal after the Siege of Mandalore. During Order 66, the renegade Sith Lord Maul used the Force to destroy the Star Destroyer's hyperdrive, causing it to crash on a moon, killing the clone navigation officer and his crew.\nThis clone navigation officer served aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal during the Siege of Mandalore. During the battle, renegade Sith Lord Maul was captured by the Galactic Republic's 332nd Division. Hence, Maul was brought to the Star Destroyer the clone navigation officer was serving on to be transported to Coruscant. Immediately after arriving, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander CT-7567 \"Rex\" entered the command bridge. The navigation officer along with other clone trooper officers saluted the duo before entering hyperspace.\nHowever en route, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who had revealed himself as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, gave Order 66, ordering all clone troopers to turn on the Jedi, including Tano. Tano managed to escaped and freed Maul to create a diversion. Maul started massacring all the clones that got in his way and eventually went to the engine room, destroying the hyperdrive, sending the Star Destroyer out of hyperspace.\nOver time, the Star Destroyer was pulled and entered the atmosphere of a moon. Another clone officer reported to the navigation officer that they had entered the atmosphere. The navigation officer ordered the bridge crew to use the retrorockets of the Star Destroyer, but that officer told him that they had lost all lateral control of the ship as the command bridge exploded, killing the officer and the bridge crew.",
