 "content": "Tih Qiqah was a member of the Shaper caste of the Yuuzhan Vong. A Master Shaper, Qiqah was assigned to the Baanu Miir in his final years. However, either by senility or sheer greed, Qiqah did not teach any Adepts during his final years. One Initiate he trained, Suung Aruh, was forced to tell the master crèche-tales with adult overtones. Tih Qiqah died shortly after the Yuuzhan Vong War began, and was replaced as lead shaper of the Baanu Miir by Nen Yim—then a mere Adept.",
