 "content": "Tadd was a human male member of the Rebel Alliance. After the Battle of Yavin, Tadd traveled to the planet Tibrin as part of a diplomatic mission with fellow Rebels Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Liddle. During the mission, Tadd attempted to throw a grenade at a group of stormtroopers; however, one stormtrooper shot his hand and the grenade fell, throwing Skywalker to the ground, who was subsequently subdued by the stormtroopers.\nTadd first appeared in \"The Trouble at Tibrin,\" the lead story of Star Wars Adventures  4. In the story, Tadd was only identified by his first name. Author Landry Q. Walker later provided some backstory for Tadd on Twitter: his surname of Marteens, that he was a farmer from Stewjon, and that he piloted an A-wing for the Alliance, which he had joined after the Battle of Yavin.",
