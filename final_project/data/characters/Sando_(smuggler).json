 "content": "Sando was a Rodian smuggler and pirate who operated in the Unknown Regions near Volik.\nSando was known for going after easy targets. She and her gang often would board damaged ships, repair them and then take their cargo as payment. They also looted old smuggler bases in the caves of Volik, since these were often deserted after a smuggling group was driven off or eliminated by rivals.\nSando and her gang were searching for the mask of Darth Nihilus, which was rumored to be in the wreckage of a Dynamic-class freighter, the Nashuaga, that crashed in the canyons of Volik. They came in contact with several other groups also searching for the mask.",
