 "content": "A Wookiee female was born to the Wookiee general Attimun and his wife along with a brother prior to the Clone Wars. During the war, Attimun became a decorated war hero on the family's home planet of Kashyyyk; however, his wife and children were all killed in the conflict. Their deaths enraged Attimun, turning him against the Galactic Republic that the Wookiees had allied with in the war and leading to his failed attack on the speakers at a conference on Kashyyyk.\nAttimun's daughter first appeared as a hologram in the comic Incident on Kashyyyk, written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Tanya Roberts. The comic was published in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.37 in 2012.",
