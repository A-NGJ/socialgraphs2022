 "content": "Kelleran Beq, nicknamed \"The Sabered Hand,\" was a human male Jedi Master who served in the Jedi Order. He was often assisted by the protocol droid AD-3 and the astromech droid LX-R5, and served aboard the starship Athylia.\nKelleran Beq was a Jedi Master who supervised Padawans as they went through their Jedi Trials. He was assisted by the protocol droid AD-3 and the astromech droid LX-R5. Beq had fond memories of his Jedi Trials and earned the nickname \"Sabered Hand\" during his time as a Padawan.\nKelleran Beq was a human male with dark skin and black hair. According to AD-3, Beq was \"halfway through his lifespan.\" While Beq was on friendly terms with his servant droid AD-3, the latter was envious of his Force powers since she lacked them as a droid. AD-3 repeatedly teased Beq about him using his Force powers to close doors and lift rocks.\nBeq was skilled with lightsabers, earning the nickname \"Sabered Hand.\" Beq had the habit of reminding AD-3 about his nickname, much to her annoyance.\nAs a Jedi, Beq was able to use the Force, which he used to levitate rocks. Beq could also communicate with the Force.\nKelleran Beq is a character created for Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge. He is portrayed by Ahmed Best, who also portrayed Jar Jar Binks. In an interview with Anthony Carboni on The Star Wars Show, Best stated that the showrunners Steve Blank and Scott Bromley, and executive producers Christine Beebe and Mickey Capoferri, had given him considerable flexibility in developing Kelleran Beq's histories, mannerisms, and even lightsaber color. Best confirmed that Beq was related to Achk Med-Beq, whom he had portrayed in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, though no canonical source has confirmed the relation.\nDuring a later interview with Kristin Baver, Best confirmed that Beq's purple lightsaber color was an intended homage to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He also stated that other aspects of Beq's character were inspired by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the Shaolin monks from Best's childhood favorite kung fu movies. Best described Beq as the first Jedi dedicated to teaching, adding that he had been inspired by Kenobi and Yoda's nurturing kind of mentorship.\nBest posted on Twitter that the pieces of Kelleran Beq's lightsaber are pieces that are available to everyone at Savi's Workshop. His philosophy when it comes to teaching is that all types of learning should be accessible to everyone, even lightsaber learning. Ahmed says that at Kelleran Beq's core he is a teacher. He said that part of the rationale behind this was his desire for Beq to be relatable to the audience rather than apart from them.",
