After that, the Scandium Team was dismantled, and Korgath continued to do field work for the Alliance.\nKorgath had a reputation for being hard and cold, although close acquaintances found him to be very warm and personable. He worked at maintaining his reputation of having a bad attitude, often starting bar brawls over minor incidents. He was considered very lucky.",
