 "content": "Eilram was a Force-sensitive Zeffo, and one of three of their species who were revered as great sages.\nEilram was a Sage revered in Zeffo culture for being of great wisdom and insight. A master of the Life Wind, they held a place of high honor within a proving ground and academy on the planet Zeffo. They were the first Zeffo to establish a relationship with the Wookiees of Kashyyyk and loved the planet's plants.\nSometime long before 14 BBY, Eilram died and was buried within the halls of the great school on Zeffo. The burial chamber was adorned with wind chimes, and its domed roof was carved in the image of a mighty wroshyr tree. Eilram's sarcophagus was interred under the stone roots of the tree, a symbol of their mighty love for Kashyyyk.",
