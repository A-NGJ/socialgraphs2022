 "content": "Keighlah was a female Human lieutenant and member of the Imperial Reclamation Service. She was second in command to Captain Barden Golah. She lost her brother on Dxun before she was assigned to Mos Ila. In 3643 BBY on Tatooine, after disabling the dampeners on an artifact being studied, she was killed, and her body taken as a vessel for the Imprisoned One. She soon started infecting other members of her team, until she was eventually killed by an Imperial individual.",
