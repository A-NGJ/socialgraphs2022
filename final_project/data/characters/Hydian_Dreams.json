 "content": "Hydian Dreams was a fathier male that mated with Solar Promenade and sired the fathier named Hy-Stepping. Three years later, he mated with Distant Star, who gave birth to the fathier named Kessel Runner in 31 ABY as a result.\nBy around 34 ABY, Hy-Stepping and Kessel Runner had become racing fathiers on the planet Cantonica. Hydian Dreams was listed as the fathiers' sire on race programs, including one collected by the Resistance mechanic Rose Tico and added to her diary.\nHydian Dreams was first mentioned in the 2018 replica journal The Last Jedi: Rose Tico: Resistance Fighter, which was written by Jason Fry.",
