 "content": "Ginger was a male Human who was recruited into the Army of Light during the New Sith Wars to train in the ways of the Jedi Order and help defend the Galactic Republic.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Ginger was born on the Outer Rim of the galaxy and recruited into the Jedi Order's Army of Light as members of the army moved across the Outer Rim. Testing positive as a Force-sensitive, Ginger was taken with the Jedi and their vassals as they followed Jedi Lord Hoth's charge towards the planet Ruusan. Serving in the army's kitchen, Ginger befriended fellow Initiate to the Order Bug while the Army was resting during the Ruusan campaign. It was Ginger who informed Bug that their friend, Tomcat, had killed Jedi General Kiel Charny. During the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, Ginger was struck down by the Jedi traitor Tomcat, now known by his true name, Darovit.",
