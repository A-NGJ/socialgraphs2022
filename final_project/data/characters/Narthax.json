 "content": "Narthax was a Human male clone from the planet Ukio. He served the Galactic Empire as a clone stormtrooper during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 3 ABY, the Empire discovered Echo Base, the Alliance's hidden headquarters located on the planet Hoth, leading to a ground invasion of the facility.\nNarthax was involved in the assault as part of the Imperial Blizzard Force. As a snowtrooper sergeant, he commanded a squad during the battle, where the Empire was victorious and forced the Alliance to evacuate the planet. Narthax trained snowtroopers in extreme-weather survival tactics, and wore full snowtrooper armor with an E-11 blaster rifle in hand.\nNarthax appears in a deleted scene of the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. The scene involved him and his snowtrooper group being tricked into entering a wampa pen during the Imperial attack on Echo Base, provoking the wampas within; C-3PO of the Rebel Alliance had ripped off the warning label on the pen's entrance while evacuating the base. The scenes surrounding the snowtroopers' initial entrance into Echo Base were filmed in England's Elstree Studios between March and April 1979.\nIn 1996, the scene with Narthax was used as the basis for \"One Step Ahead,\" a short story in the second edition of Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back. Although \"One Step Ahead\" canonizes the event of wampas attacking snowtroopers, no link was ever officially made between production photos of the deleted scene and the short story. Therefore, this article avoids making any in-universe links between Narthax and any of the snowtroopers from \"One Step Ahead.\"\nIn spring 1996, the deleted scene was described, along with photos showing Narthax and his squad, in the \"Prequel Update\" article for Star Wars Insider 29. In fall 1998, the CD-ROM Star Wars: Behind the Magic also included the deleted scene with photos of the snowtroopers. While Behind the Magic states that all the snowtroopers were being attacked by the wampas in the deleted scene, the scene itself only shows one of the snowtroopers entering the pen and being attacked by the wampas.\nLater, in October of 1998, David West Reynolds' reference title Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary provided the first canonical depiction of Narthax with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity, and the snowtrooper sergeant was identified by name in a card for the Special Edition Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game the next month. In 2011, the scene depicting Narthax was officially released as part of the Star Wars: The Complete Saga Blu-ray set.",
