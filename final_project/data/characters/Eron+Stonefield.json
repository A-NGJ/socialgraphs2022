 "content": "Eron Stonefield was a beautiful, red-haired woman who took up the profession of bounty hunting during the time of the Galactic Civil War, though before this time, she had mastered several martial arts.\nDespite the fact that Eron grew up while the Galactic Empire was in power, she did not always agree with the Emperor and his New Order.\nEron was among a group of bounty hunters who were hired by Eugene Talmont to track down Han Solo shortly after the Battle of Yavin. This was in fact simply to allow Talmont to claim the prestige awarded to one who could capture Solo in order for him to achieve a better posting than he currently had on Tatooine. She, along with the other hunters, Dengar and Udin, tracked down Solo, but were unable to apprehend him, and instead kidnapped Grubba the Hutt.",
