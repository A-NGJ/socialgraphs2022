 "content": "Cyria Dombasle was a female Human working as inventory supervisor in the weapon storage asteroid Rothe Gate, in the Cularin system asteroid belt.\nIn 32 BBY, this person was loyal to crimelord Nirama, while a faction of Nirama's criminal Organization known as The Cell was trying to oust him. The Cell decided to forge some proofs relating this person to themselves; this would force Nirama to replace a reliable employee.\nThe Cell's plot also included other loyal employees in Rothe Gate, including Maarten Haal, Gal O'Wei and Plu Markeela. They began the operation in a moment when all the four of them were outside Rothe Gate. The scheme failed, Nirama defeated the Cell leaders and he never doubted of his employees' integrity.",
