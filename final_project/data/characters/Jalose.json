 "content": "Jalose was a Human female who served in the Rebel Alliance as a guerrilla fighter during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0 ABY, Jalose fought alongside Merrik and other Rebel soldiers in a campaign against Governor Grigor to rid the planet of Imperial occupation on the planet M'haeli. She became increasingly resentful of Mora, who she saw as competing with her for the attentions of Merrik as well as causing complications for the rebellion, and betrayed her to the Empire.\nLater, when she realized Mora was the descendant of the planets murdered royal family, she was distraught at where her jealousy had led her. Jalose redeemed herself by throwing herself in the path of a shot fired at Mora by the bounty hunter Glott. She slowly passed away from her wound.",
