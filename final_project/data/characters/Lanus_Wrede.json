 "content": "Lanus Wrede was a male Human Senator of Sermeria who served in the Galactic Senate during the waning years of the Republic.\nIn 22 BBY, when he claimed that the Baktoid Armor Workshop had been manufacturing battle droids in non-Republic worlds. This statement was refuted by several business analysts, and turned out to be false after a three-month investigation. With his political career and reputation shattered, Wrede committed suicide.\nIn reality, Wrede was correct in his suspicions, and these hidden battle droids would soon emerge from planets such as Geonosis during the Clone Wars.",
