 "content": "Fetwin Porlo was a male Toydarian information broker who operated from Point Nadir.\nFetwin Porlo started as a low-level librarian at a preeminent university. He stumbled upon information during his work that implicated a number of the high ranking officials of his university of many crimes, and he immediately used this information to blackmail them. After a while, his demands created a large amount of enemies and they decided it would be easier to eliminate him then to continue to pay him. This forced him to flee to Point Nadir.\nPorlo was a nervous, overweight Toydarian. He constantly flitted around and never stayed in one place long. He usually wore unwashed lounge suits. He spoke in a quick, distracted manner that was hard for the casual observer to understand.",
