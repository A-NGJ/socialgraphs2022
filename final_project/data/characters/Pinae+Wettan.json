 "content": "Pinae Wettan was the caretaker of Quekka Trench Station. He was elderly and decided to supplement his income by renting out space in the storage pod to smugglers who were looking for a place to store their goods. He was very cautious and would not let more than one party on the station at the time to avoid being caught up in conflicts.",
