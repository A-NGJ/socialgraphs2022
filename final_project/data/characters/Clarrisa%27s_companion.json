 "content": "A companion of Clarrisa was a Human male who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, he decided to take Clarrisa on a surprise vacation to Mustafar. However, when they arrived, Clarrisa was furious at him for taking her to such a inhospitable world.\nClarrisa's companion was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nWhen examined, his name only appeared as \"an unhappy tourist.\"",
