 "content": "Ja'Boag was a male Gossam who served as head of the Rim Commercial Mining and oversaw operations on the planet Moorjhone during the Clone Wars.\nIn 20 BBY, Ja'Boag placed a bounty on Savage Opress and his brother Darth Maul, who had recently been revealed to be alive. The Jedi Council learned of this and sent Jedi Masters Salmara and Judd, along with Salmara's Padawan, Dray, to Moorjhone. However, Maul and Opress also traveled to Moorjhone, and arrived before the Jedi. After Ja'Boag and his security forces engaged the brothers, Maul and Opress slaughtered the security forces and threw Ja'Boag off a balcony. The three Jedi arrived just in time, and Ja'Boag was saved when Salmara caught him with the Force. Later, he was taken into custody and killed by the Sith brothers.",
