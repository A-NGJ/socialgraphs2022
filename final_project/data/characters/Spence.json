 "content": "Spence was a Human male who joined the Erased along with his twin brother, Gilly, after the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire by Emperor Palpatine. Spence and his brother never talked much and kept things to themselves after they joined the resistance group. When stormtroopers attacked one of the bases, Spence fought alongside his brother to defend the base, but they had no chance and were both shot down by concentrated fire.",
