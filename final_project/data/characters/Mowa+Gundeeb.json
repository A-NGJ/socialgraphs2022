 "content": "Mowa Gundeeb was the First Mate of the Jedi Dreamer.\nGundeeb grew bored of life on Sullust and used his talents at combat to leave at a young age and join a mercenary group. He was nearly killed when his group was ambushed by a rival gang of mercenaries. He ejected in an escape pod and would have been killed if not for the timely arrival of a patrol of X-wings that drove off the hostiles. Gundeeb felt he had a debt to Korren Starchaser who was leading the patrol, and joined the Rebel alliance.\nGundeeb was unusual for a Sullustan in that he was quiet with no sense of humor. He was a competent soldier and had an interest in non-human philosophy.",
