 "content": "Paemos was a male Rodian and ranged weapons expert found in the village of Aurilia on the planet Dathomir during the Galactic Civil War. He was friendly with everyone he met, a trait that made him few friends on Rodia but many elsewhere. He was much happier in Aurilia than he ever was on Rodia and would have given his life to defend it if needed. He also was Force-sensitive and knew a thing or two about Force techniques, and was known to teach at least one Force-sensitive individual in their usage.\nBy the time that Aurilia became a township Paemos had been elected the mayor despite many people's expectations that Rohak, the village elder, would become the first mayor.\nPaemos appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
