 "content": "Ronin Lightrunner was a male Mon Calamari biologist who lived on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he resided in the city of Moenia and studied the veermoks. Lightrunner was really impassioned by these creatures and excited by his work. For his researches, Ronin Lightrunner used to visit the Veermok Cave in the Gallo Mountains and befriended with the Gungans of the Gungan Warrior Stronghold.\nRonin Lightrunner was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
