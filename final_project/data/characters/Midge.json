 "content": "Midge was a Human male native of a rural region of the planet Chandrila. By the year 4 ABY, Midge was a corporal in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and was newly recruited into General Crix Madine's commando unit as a field technician. The same year, Midge attended a briefing held on the Rebel flagship Home One, during which the Alliance discussed its plans to attack the Galactic Empire's second Death Star battlestation.\nThe Human male Midge hailed from a rural region of the planet Chandrila. At some point he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic upon the inspiration of the Alliance's Supreme Commander—and fellow Chandrilan—Mon Mothma. Midge became an Alliance corporal by the year 4 ABY. By that time, he had recently been recruited into General Crix Madine's commando unit as a field technician.\nThat same year, Midge was present during a briefing held on the Rebel flagship, the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Home One, during which Mon Mothma announced the Alliance's plan to strike at the Galactic Empire's second Death Star battlestation in orbit over the moon of Endor. General Madine, who was in charge of planning the attack, announced that members of a strike team led by General Han Solo would be sent to the moon to deactivate the SLD-26 planetary shield generator protecting the Death Star, allowing Alliance starfighters to destroy the battlestation's main reactor.\nMidge was a fair-skinned man. He was a self-taught marksman and scout. Mon Mothma inspired him to join the Rebel Alliance.\nWhen he attended the briefing aboard Home One, Corporal Midge wore the same uniform worn by other Rebel commandos at the briefing.\nMidge first appeared as a background Rebel character during the Home One briefing in 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. He was portrayed by an uncredited extra. In July 2000, Midge was given a name and brief backstory in the Death Star II Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
