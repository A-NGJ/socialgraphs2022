 "content": "Tunga Arpagion was a male Clawdite shape-shifter agent who was known to be a professional actor and impersonator. He was recruited by the Alliance to Restore the Republic for a mission they undertook on Mon Cala. His impersonation of Imperial Moff Tan Hubi allowed Leia Organa and her team to locate Lee-Char, former king of Mon Cala, and deliver his last words back to the Mon Calamari.\nAfter a brief return to acting, he was once again recruited by Organa, who required his talents for a mission to Shu-Torun, with their goal to take down the Spike as an economic strike to the Empire. He impersonated the ore-duke Lord Or-Tar in order to get Organa a scan of Queen Trios' eye, which could unlock Shu-Torun's security systems. Arpagion later took the form of Queen Trios to rid the Ancestral Retreat of its staff, allowing the rebels to deactivate the security systems of Shu-Torun.\nTheir plan went astray when the Partisans, a rebel insurgent group recruited for the attack, sabotaged the Spike so that it would destroy Shu-Torun in revenge for the Empire's destruction of Jedha. When the rebels became trapped by both an orbital bombardment and a group of TIE fighters, Arpagion sacrificed himself, using his shapeshifting abilities to trick the Imperials into believing he was Organa, shooting down his ship. However, Arpagion survived, and was rescued by cultists of the Central Isopter, who initiated him into the cult against his will.\nA Clawdite shape-shifter, Arpagion gained a reputation for the various acts of impersonation he had achieved, such as playing the role of the late Thespus-V for a week after she died before anyone noticed. He also had several connections, including many members of the Meor nobility near Encrust II. At some point, he was caught and imprisoned by Dex Acquisitions, who planned to hand the Clawdite over to the Galactic Empire in exchange for a reward.\nAs part of her mission to recruit the fleet of the Mon Calamari into the Rebel Alliance, Leia Organa planned to kidnap Tan Hubi, Moff of the Calamari sector, in order to use his bio-signature to access the facility where the Mon Calamari king, Lee-Char, was being held. When bringing the idea before the Alliance High Command, General Davits Draven suggested Arpagion, who was being held at the Dex Acquisitions Depot on Meor Ain. Organa led her team on a mission to rescue Arpagion, tricking her way into the facility by pretending that she had been captured by Chewbacca. After the Wookiee had knocked the guards unconscious, Luke Skywalker cut the cell door's panel off with his lightsaber, allowing Chewbacca to break the door down. Organa and her team entered the cell to find Arpagion, who was in the form of her father, Bail Organa, as a joke. An offended Leia saw through the disguise, and punched Arpagion, who reverted back into his regular form. Organa stunned Arpagion with her blaster, and Chewbacca carried him out of the prison and back to the Millennium Falcon.\nOnce he was aboard the Falcon, Organa showed Arpagion a hologram of Hubi, asking if he could impersonate the Moff for several hours. Arpagion stated that he could, but would be unable to impersonate him while on duty. Organa told Arpagion that it would not be necessary, due to a performance at the Moncaladrome which Hubi would be attending. Arpagion inquired as to why why Organa needed the Moff, but the details of the mission were confidential until he accepted. After Arpagion accepted the job, the team went to Mon Cala, where Arpagion stayed in a cave with Leia, waiting until the Moff had been captured. Han Solo and Chewbacca managed to kidnap the Moff, and brought him to Arpagion, who studied his appearance and voice. As Hubi yelled out, Arpagion transformed into him, repeating his words back to him. Appearing exactly like Moff Hubi, Arpagion headed for the Moncaladrome as Organa's team took the Moff to Strokill Prime.\nThe arrival of \"Hubi\" was announced by C-3PO, and Arpagion entered the Moncaladrome, waving to the crowd. He sat between Queen Trios and Regent Dors Urtya, and watched the Mon Calamari opera. C-3PO informed Arpagion that his entrance was out of character for the Moff, but he disregarded it, asking the protocol droid to translate the show for him. During an intermission, Arpagion answered several questions under the\nguise of the Moff. The second half of the show started, and Arpagion returned to his seat. As he pretended to be Hubi, Organa and her team had successfully broken into the Imperial facility on Strokill Prime using the real Moff's bio-signature.\nWhen the opera ended before Organa's team had given an all-clear, Arpagion took the stage with C-3PO and R2-D2, performing a recital from the poet Moobian Tax to buy them some time. On Strokill Prime, the real Moff activated an button in Lee-Char's cell, alerting several stormtroopers to the fact that the Moff on Mon Cala was an impersonator. Stormtroopers burst into the Moncaladrome, announcing that the Hubi on the stage was not real, but a sudden light failure allowed Arpagion to escape with the droids. Hiding backstage, Arpagion shape-shifted into a Mon Calamari, disguising the droids in colorful costumes. They slipped back into the chaos, escaping the Moncaladrome. Arpagion and the droids, no longer disguised, met back up with the rest of the team, but they were confronted by Regent Urtya, who demanded to take the recording that Organa had made of Lee-Char's last words. With the mission an apparent failure, the team boarded the Falcon and left the planet. As they left, Urtya broadcasted Lee-Char's message to the Mon Calamari ships, causing them to overthrow the Imperials on board. However, Urtya had sent the message too early, and several Imperial-class Star Destroyers entered the system.\nAboard the Falcon, Arpagion asked whether Organa could contact her rebel friends, but she was unable to, as the Imperials would jam any signals being sent. However, they received a message from Urtya, who had contacted the Rebellion himself. The Falcon crew watched as a Rebel Alliance fleet arrived above Mon Cala, entering battle against the Imperial forces. Arpagion was shocked when the escape pods from the cruiser Aurora Flare were shot down by the TIE fighters. The Aurora Flare itself was damaged by Admiral Tyrus Meori's Star Destroyer, causing its cargo of coaxium to explode, damaging the Star Destroyer and allowing the rebel fleet to escape with the Mon Calamari ships. Arpagion was dropped off at the Cosmatanic Steppes, where he thanked Organa, who still had not forgiven him for pretending to be her father. Arpagion told her that he'd make it up to her, before walking away from the Falcon. As the Falcon left, Arpagion excitedly thought of the events at Mon Cala as a story to be told, giving it the name \"mutiny on Mon Cala\".\nAfter the end of the mutiny, Arpagion returned to his career of acting. He created a show based on the events of the mutiny, albeit with changes to the characters' names due to a suggestion from his agent, performing it in a theater on Gralack, where he took the role of Luke Skywalker. During the play, several stormtroopers intervened, accusing it of being treasonous material. Arpagion shape-shifted back into himself, and along with the other actors, attempted to run backstage. When the stormtroopers followed them, intending to put them under arrest, the real Luke Skywalker stepped in, taking down the stormtroopers with his lightsaber. Leia Organa and Han Solo led Arpagion and the other actors out, requesting the Clawdite's help in another mission.\nAfter recruiting both the Partisans from Jedha along with the engineer and slicer Meorti, Organa gathered her team in the Millennium Falcon aboard the Home One. She revealed that their objective was to take down the Imperial world of Shu-Torun as an economic strike to the Empire. They traveled to the planet, landing close to the Spike, a structure that powered the entire mining operation. Arpagion was eager to hear Organa's plan, and was not optimistic upon hearing that they had to shut the Spike down. In order to access the planet's master security controls, they needed a scan of Queen Trios of Shu-Torun's eyes. Arpagion was doubtful about successfully kidnapping the queen, but Organa instead planned to impersonate an ore-duke and use the disguise to get close enough for a scanner to view her eyes.\nUsing a speeder, Arpagion, along with Organa, Solo, Meorti and C-3PO, located the ship of Lord Or-Tar in the Abyssal Approach, boarding it and stunned both Or-Tar and his pilot. Arpagion shape-shifted into the form of Or-Tar, and the team took the ship to the Abyssal Rooms, where Trios was holding a gathering. Arpagion and C-3PO, who wore the scanner around his head, walked towards the party, pleased to be working with each other for a second time.\nInside the Abyssal Rooms, Arpagion spotted Trios, and went to greet her. While C-3PO's scanner recorded her eyes, Arpagion distracted the queen, showing off the earring that held his comlink. Trios was suspicious of his display of wealth and the apparently new protocol droid, as Or-Tar had previously complained about the Empire's high quotas. Once the scan was successful, Leia spoke to Arpagion through the comlink, telling him to find an excuse to leave. Arpagion claimed that the earring was merely made of tin, and that the droid was useless, bidding farewell to the queen. Before leaving, Arpagion gave Trios a subtle message under orders from Organa, repeating a phrase that she had used previously.\nArpagion left the Abyssal Rooms, calming a nervous C-3PO on the way to Or-Tar's ship. He reverted into his regular form, and the team headed for the Ancestral Retreat, leaving Or-Tar and his pilot safely on an isolated island. Arpagion returned the clothing he had taken from the ore-duke, before putting on a royal dress that he would wear to impersonate Queen Trios. They landed at the Retreat, where Arpagion, who disembarked from the ship in disguise as Trios, was welcomed by the queen's staff. Arpagion gathered the staff and took their weapons under the pretense of an inspection, before locking them in a room, leaving free roam of the retreat to Organa's team.\nThe Clawdite returned to his normal form, meeting the other rebels in the retreat's throne room, where he was congratulated by C-3PO. Arpagion enjoyed the chance to sit on the throne while Meorti sliced into the security systems. She was able to deactivate the systems, giving Organa's team full control of the planet. However, Trios discovered that she had lost control, finding herself trapped inside the Abyssal Rooms. While the team waited for Skywalker and the Partisans to take down the Spike, Arpagion suggested passing the time with conversational improvisation games. Unknown to Organa and the rest of her team, the Partisans planned to sabotage the plan, causing the Spike to destroy Shu-Torun as revenge for what the Empire had done to Jedha.\nInside the Abyssal Rooms, Trios and her Grand Marshal devised a plan to break out of the Abyssal Approach using mining equipment, heading for the retreat. At the same time, Imperial commander Kanchar was alerted of the rebel attack. As Trios' ship approached, Arpagion and the rest of the team prepared to defend the Ancestral Retreat. Trios crashed her ship into the retreat, forcing the rebels to dive aside to avoid it. While the rebels fought back the Shu-Torun soldiers, Commander Kanchar arrived above the planet, choosing to bombard the retreat.\nThe rebels retreated from the bombardment, returning to the throne room. Arpagion was concerned with the increasing danger of the situation, asking whether they planned to leave before it was too late. Trios managed to enter the throne room with several soldiers, dueling Organa. Trios was fatally injured, leading her soldiers to rush to attack the rebels while Arpagion looked on in shock. Before dying, Trios accused the rebels of attempting to destroy the planet, and Organa realized that their plan had gone wrong.\nUnable to leave in their ship due to the TIE fighters attacking the retreat, and with Trios' forces attempting to cut their way into the throne room, the rebels saw no way to escape alive. Upon hearing that the TIEs prevented any hope of being retrieved by Chewbacca in the Falcon, Arpagion ran towards their ship. Organa and Solo believed that the Clawdite was attempting to steal the ship and escape on his own, but Arpagion intended to distract the TIE fighters away from the retreat.\nImpersonating Organa's appearance and voice, Arpagion allowed Commander Kanchar to intercept a transmission that tricked the Imperials into thinking the rebels were escaping. Kanchar ordered the TIEs at the retreat to pursue the supposed escape vessel, while Arpagion contacted Organa, informing the rebels of his distraction. Arpagion was successful in distracting the TIE fighters, but his ship was shot down, exploding in midair.\nArpagion's supposed sacrifice allowed the rebels to make their way to the Spike, convincing the Partisans that destroying Shu-Torun was unnessecary. The Spike was destroyed as according to Organa's plan, and the rest of the rebel team managed to escape the planet and return to the Home One. While they presumed that Arpagion had died, he had survived the explosion of the ship, the wreckage of which had crashed onto solid ground, where Arpagion was later discovered by members of the Central Isopter cult, who had migrated to Shu-Torun to witness the impending destruction. The cultists rescued Arpagion, and despite his protest, welcomed him to the cult.\nAs an actor, Arpagion enjoyed using his shape-shifting abilities, and the fame he gained from it. He was proud of this, and, according to Han Solo, often liked to talk about himself. When being rescued by Leia Organa, he impersonated her father, Bail Organa, as a joke. He eventually apologized for doing so, claiming he'd make up for it. Ultimately, he chose to sacrifice his life on Shu-Torun for the safety of the rebels, though he managed to survive.\nHe saw the impersonation jobs he carried out for the Rebel Alliance as no different from his regular acting roles. Witnessing the battle above Mon Cala during the Mon Calamari mutiny, he reacted as if it were a play, applauding the heroism and skill of the rebels. Once the mutiny was successful, Arpagion saw its potential, proceeding to actually make a play out of the events.\nWhile performing a recital in the disguise of Moff Tan Hubi, he was disappointed, feeling that the audience at the Moncaladrome missed the subtleties of his performance. During the impersonation, he put on a vain and dramatic personality, so much so that C-3PO advised him that it wasn't in character for the Moff. Arpagion disregarded this, choosing to perform the role the way he liked. He later acted in a similar fashion while impersonating Queen Trios of Shu-Torun. While having to answer questions in disguise as the Moff, Arpagion claimed the Empire was increasing grants towards the arts, even though it was untrue.\nArpagion opposed the Galactic Empire, knowing they were against him and his actions, and was shocked at the sight of them destroying fleeing escape pods above Mon Cala. Creating a play from the events of the mutiny, he was eventually wanted by the Empire for performing what they claimed was treasonous material.\nA male Clawdite, Arpagion possessed green skin and yellow eyes when in his regular form.\nArpagion was known for his talents in acting and impersonation, and was able to perform the role of the late Thespus-V for a week after she had died until anyone discovered the truth. He also used his acting abilities to perform plays, in which he could shape-shift to fit his roles.\nHe claimed to be trained to improvise, and used his skills to pass as Moff Tan Hubi during conversations at the Moncaladrome. Arpagion also had skills in costuming, which he used to disguise the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 after his impersonation was discovered.\nTunga Arpagion first appeared in Star Wars  45, a canon comic written by Kieron Gillen, illustrated by Salvador Larroca, and published on March 21, 2018.",
