 "content": "This stormtrooper was a clone of an unknown genotype and was stationed onboard the Death Star during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Stationed onboard the Death Star, he was part of a squad that were assigned to go up to investigate a ruse at the Detention Block AA-23. As one of his fellow stormtroopers sliced the doors open and was shot to death by Han Solo, he informed the others that the rebels were heading down the cell bay, knowing there was no where out for them to run.",
