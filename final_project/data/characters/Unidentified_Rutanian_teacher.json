 "content": "This individual was a male Rutanian who lived on the planet Rutan. Sometime in 44 BBY, he served as a teacher in the Royal School of Leadership. When the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi went to the school while searching for Prince Taroon, the teacher told the Jedi that if Taroon has not yet left for Senali, he was most likely tinkering with program boards in the school's tech room.",
