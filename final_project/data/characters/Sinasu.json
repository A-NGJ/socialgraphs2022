 "content": "Sinasu was a Hutt crime lord of the Gorensla kajidic who operated on the moon Nar Shaddaa during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He was a rival of the Hutt Noako and the pair became embroiled in a gang war. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Sinasu tasked a group of individuals who were indebted to him with smuggling a cargo of Krayt dragon eggs and a small Krayt Dragon to Nar Shaddaa from the planet Tatooine. Sinasu went into hiding among the outlaw tech gang TechTank, in their shop in the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, but the facility fell under attack from Cordol's Chain, a bounty hunter group hired by Noako. The agents smuggling Sinasu's Krayt dragon arrived at the shop and rescued Sinasu, and at his direction they transported him to the little-used freight pad Spaceport 27 on the planet Nal Hutta, where his personal light freighter Red Nebula was docked. To reward the agents for their efforts, Sinasu relieved them of a portion of the debt that they owed to him.",
