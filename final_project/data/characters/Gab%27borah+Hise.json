 "content": "Gab'borah Hise was Ygabba's father and a dessert chef for Jabba the Hutt. Once a head chef at a cantina in Mos Eisley, Gab'borah was considered \"too successful\" and was taken to serve Jabba. He was a friend of Boba Fett in Jabba's Palace. Ygabba was taken away from her father by a CIS Neimoidian named Gilramos Libkath and was saved by Boba, who brought her back to Gab'borah Hise. Gab'borah and Ygabba re-fitted Boba's armor so it fit him easily.\nHe was renowned for his delicious Ziziibbon truffles.",
