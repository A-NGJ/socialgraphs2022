 "content": "In 3 ABY, an Imperial officer spotted the Rebel Fleet while they were on their way to the Rebel rendezvous point. He then, with his Strike-class medium cruiser and a squadron of nine TIE/LN starfighters, engaged the Rebel fleet. Rogue Squadron attacked his ship and the squadrons to prevent him from reporting their presence. Although he attempted to report to the Executor the location of the Rebel Fleet, the Rebels had instituted a jamming field that prevented them from sending the message. Eventually, he attempted to call a retreat, even maximizing shielding on the rear of his cruiser to ensure his escape. However, he failed to also ensure heavy shielding for the bow of the cruiser, which led to his death when Rogue 5 exploited this and attacked the cruiser head-on. Despite his death, his attempted transmission nonetheless made its way to the Executor, with Darth Vader reporting it.",
