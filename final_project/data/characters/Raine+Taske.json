 "content": "Raine Taske was a male Human trader and artisan who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Raine Taske resided on board Tansarii Point Station, in the Bright Jewel system. He often worked with the Bith vendor Jesi who provided him resources to craft various kinds of items.\nIn 1 ABY, a spacer who was himself an artisan arrived on the station aboard the Millennium Falcon along with Han Solo and Chewbacca. Since Raine Taske was an old buddy of his, Solo recommended the spacer work with the trader. The spacer therefore met Raine, and both agreed with sharing their crafting skills. First, Taske asked the spacer to help the bartender of the station's cantina prepare some drinks. The spacer later returned to Taske, and the two traders started to work together. The spacer taught Raine Taske to craft clothing, make food, namely bofa treats, and produce mineral and flora survey tools.\nRaine Taske appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Raine Taske was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
