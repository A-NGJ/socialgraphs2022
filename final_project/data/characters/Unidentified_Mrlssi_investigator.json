 "content": "This male Mrlssi was a police detective in the Coruscant Security Force in 32 BBY.\nThis Mrlssi, along with his Sullustan partner, investigated the destruction of a PCBU and the death of two police officers. However, not knowing that a Sith had committed the crime, they had no answer as to how someone had jumped 15 feet into the air to disable the PCBU without getting shot. Though Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi promised them the support of the Jedi Order, he was called away to the help with the blockade of Naboo.",
