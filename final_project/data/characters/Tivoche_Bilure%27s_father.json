 "content": "The father of Tivoche Bilure was a Corellian human male who lived on the planet Corellia in a working-class Coronet City neighborhood that never received any attention from the authorities. His family lived in poverty and never had enough credits to buy sufficient food. At some point, Bilure's father took ill with Shipbreaker's Cough. The fear of working his entire life in poverty and seeing no future for himself other than growing old and developing the same disease as his father eventually drove Bilure to leave Corellia behind.",
