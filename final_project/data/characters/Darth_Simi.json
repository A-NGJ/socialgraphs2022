 "content": "Darth Simi was a priestess affiliated with the Sith tradition of Force-users. She was kept alive for millennia through a process of sacrificing young Jedi—the ideological antithesis of the Sith—to the dark side of the Force. At one point, Simi scoured the galaxy for her next victim.\nDarth Simi was a Zabrak with light gray skin and black geometric-patterned tattoos that covered her head, torso, legs, and hands. The Sith's dark hair was arranged in a mass of tendril-like braids extending from the top of her head. Simi was skilled in the use of twin double-bladed lightsabers.\nSimi wore a long brown coat with an ornamented collar; a brown skirt; a wide brown belt; and brown straps across her abdomen and chest. She carried two paired lightsabers that each had a short hilt and produced two short yellow blades.\nDarth Simi was created by Dorian Cleavenger, who in 2009 depicted her in a painting that was included in the 2010 book Star Wars Art: Visions, which collected works by various artists inspired by the Star Wars franchise.",
