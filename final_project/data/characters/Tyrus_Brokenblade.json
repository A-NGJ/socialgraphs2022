 "content": "Tyrus Brokenblade was a male Mandalorian warrior of Clan Varad who lived during the third Galactic War, and represented Clan Varad in Heta Kol's organization known as the Hidden Chain.\nIn 3626 BBY, members of Clan Varad joined in on an attack on the Mandalorian ship the Spirit of Vengeance II alongside the Ash'ad and the Dar'manda at the behest of Heta Kol. Following this attack, after they had secured the banner of Clan Cadera, Brokenblade met with Heta Kol, Bask Sunn, and Durn Wynnward. An argument broke out between Brokenblade and Wynnward but was quickly stopped by Kol when she pulled out a thermal detonator and threw it at Brokenblade. Brokenblade managed to catch and keep it from exploding, and was then stabbed twice by Kol as a demonstration of how they all relied on each other. Kol deactivated the thermal detonator, and Brokenblade was assisted by members of Clan Varad before being dismissed to fulfill the orders given to them.",
