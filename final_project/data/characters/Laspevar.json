 "content": "Laspevar was the leader of the Taloraanian Denfrandi tribe during the Galactic Civil War. He was a wise man who preferred peaceful negotiations to violent solutions, and was much respected by his people.\nHe made contact with the Rebel Alliance, when he saved the lives of Rebel prospectors, whose space ship was just about to crash due to a severe atmospheric storm. He also subsequently helped them acquire a starship from the hostile Wind Raider tribe.",
