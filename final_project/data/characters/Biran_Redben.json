 "content": "Biran Redben was a human male criminal who worked in a gang as a thief during the New Republic Era. At some point, he was arrested on charges of medical malpractice and was sentenced to serve fifty years on Tamazall for his crimes. Around 9 ABY, he and a group of compatriots ambushed the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin on Tatooine. Their goal was to capture Djarin's infant companion Grogu, a powerful Force-sensitive child. Although Redben's crew were successfully able to surprise the Mandalorian, they were ultimately defeated in combat.\nSometime later, Redben's profile in the New Republic prison registry was one of several that Marshal Carasynthia Dune looked at from her office on the planet Nevarro while searching for the profile of prisoner Migs Mayfeld.\nBiran Redben first appeared in \"Chapter 10: The Passenger,\" the second episode of the second season of The Mandalorian,\" which was released on November 6, 2020. The character went unnamed in the episode\" and was only identified later as Biran Redben through Aurebesh text in the sixth episode of the season, \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy,\" which was released on December 4, 2020.",
