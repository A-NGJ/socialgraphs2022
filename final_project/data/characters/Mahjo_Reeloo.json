 "content": "Mahjo Reeloo was a human female and self-proclaimed scoundrel. Originally one of two clones created to serve the rogue Kaminoan scientist Kolac Pru, she came to regret doing so and left, while her fellow clone continued to assist Pru in her absence. After learning that the Mandragonian Mob had hired Pru to replicate a sample of the deadly thornsuckle plant, she vowed to stop him and destroy it, purchasing a defoliator bomb on the black market and hiring the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca to take her to the Undervaults of Gwongdeen under the pretense of stealing from one of the deposit boxes. With the help of Solo, Chewbacca, and the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, Reeloo managed to get the defoliator bomb to the Undervaults, but realized Pru had already collected the plant. To get to Pru, she fought and defeated her clone. Pretending to be the clone herself, she boarded Pru's starship with the bomb, which activated, destroying the plant and seemingly herself. However, she had survived, and later contacted Ohnaka, who she assisted by retrieving the Millennium Falcon from Bazine Netal, returning it to Batuu.",
