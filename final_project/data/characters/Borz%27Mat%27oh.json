 "content": "Borz'Mat'oh was a philosopher of the Duinuogwuin species. In 15,500 BBY, Borz'Mat'oh's species became embroiled in the Duinuogwuin Contention, a conflict with the Galactic Republic, but the philosopher was able to forge a peace between the Duinuogwuin and the Republic after meeting with their Supreme Chancellor Fillorean. After the Contention, Borz'Mat'oh and Fillorean founded the University of Coruscant on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant, and the pair were immortalized in statues crafted from the dark glass known as chalcedony.\nBorz'Mat'oh was first mentioned in the 2003 sourcebook Coruscant and the Core Worlds.",
