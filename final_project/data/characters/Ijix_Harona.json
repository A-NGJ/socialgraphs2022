 "content": "Ijix Harona was an officer of the New Republic Defense Force and later Galactic Alliance Defense Force.\nIn 16 ABY, Lieutenant Harona was assigned to the starship, Glorious, where he served under Colonel Ejagga Pakkpekatt in his search for the Teljkon Vagabond.\nFollowing a promotion around 28 ABY, Colonel Harona was serving as commanding officer of Scimitar Squadron in the war against the Yuuzhan Vong.\nThe New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way describes Harona as both a Colonel and a Major. His rank may have been a brevet promotion during the war or a simple publishing mistake, especially as he was flying under the command of Lt. Colonel Jaina Solo in The Final Prophecy. However, in his entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, he is stated to be a Colonel by the time he commands Scimitar Squadron.",
