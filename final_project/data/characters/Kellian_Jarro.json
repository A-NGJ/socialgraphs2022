 "content": "Kellian Jarro was a Human male Jedi Master during the Cold War. He was both hated and respected among the Mandalorians for his actions during the Sacking of Coruscant. As the Jedi Temple burned, Master Jarro single-handedly eliminated over one hundred battle-hardened Mandalorian commandos in the streets of Galactic City.\nThe survivors described him as an unstoppable force of nature, deflecting heavy blaster fire and slamming armor-plated warriors to the ground so hard that their rocket packs exploded on impact. Nearly half of Master Jarro's victims came from the venerable Clan Spar, which swore an oath to repay the debt. Unfortunately, the clan members were executed for crimes against the Sith Empire before they could make good on that promise.\nDuring the Cold War, Jarro was listed as the final target in the Great Hunt. Tarro Blood tried taking down Jarro but was quickly subdued by a mind trick and imprisoned. Blood claimed that another approaching bounty hunter was his accomplice and Jarro believed him. The Republic cruiser Aurora soon captured a D5-Mantis Patrol Craft emerging out of hyperspace, but the Hunter aboard blasted through the Aurora's security and confronted Jarro. The Jedi Master attempted to use the Force to convince the Hunter to surrender but his opponent had a stronger will than Blood. He then attempted to reason, stating that revenge profits no one but the Hunter wouldn't back down and killed Jarro.\nJarro's death was the catalyst that resulted in his old friend, Battlemaster Jun Seros to begin persecuting his murderer.",
