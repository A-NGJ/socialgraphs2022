 "content": "Merile Yurrion was a Human male who held the rank of Moff in service of the resurgent Sith Empire. During the Cold War, he acted as the sector overseer of the Arkanis sector.\nYurrion believed that the desert planet Tatooine could be reshaped as a bulwark against the influence of the Galactic Republic and the criminal cartels of the Outer Rim. However, he did not have enough troops from the Imperial Military, and thus was forced to recruit Mandalorian clans settled on Tatooine. Moff Yurrion recruited agents of the Empire who had completed their own personal agendas on Tatooine to assist him in this endeavor.",
