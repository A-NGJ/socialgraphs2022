 "content": "Alastar Treen was a male Human Senator who represented Corulag in the Galactic Senate during the waning years of the Republic. In 22 BBY, before the battle of Geonosis, an assassination attempt was made on his life by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The attempt failed when he was rescued by Sia-Lan Wezz, Rorworr, Arani Korden, and a group of adventurers. He was replaced by Zafiel Snopps after he was killed later by the Separatists during the start of the Clone Wars.",
