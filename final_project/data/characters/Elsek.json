 "content": "Elsek was a Human male from Kuat who served as a sergeant and a scout trooper in the Stormtrooper Corps, eventually serving in Tempest Force.\nElsek was partners with Avarik since graduation from the Corulag academy. He was often forced to cover for his partner's rash decisions, such as bailing Avarik out of fights with drunks in local bars and enlisted clubs. When Avarik was accosted by Han Solo, he signaled Elsek to go for help. As Elsek took off on his 74-Z speeder bike, Chewbacca destroyed it with his bowcaster, and the scout was propelled into the air.",
