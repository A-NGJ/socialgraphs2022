 "content": "Squoxx was a male Rutian Twi'lek hunter who worked for King Prana. He rivaled the hunters Winloss and Nokk. After Chelli Aphra hired him to incapacitate the Shadowfang Beast prior to 3 ABY, Squoxx secretly aimed to kill it, believing Aphra wanted to own the creature. He died during the hunt, but not before murdering the beast.\nSquoxx gained fame as a hunter by working for King Grevoth Prana IX. After Doctor Chelli Aphra was swallowed alive by the Shadowfang Beast on X3-299-11 while attempting to steal an artifact prior to 3 ABY, she hired several hunters to subdue the beast but not kill it, allowing her to escape safely. Squoxx was one of the hunters she hired, and he accepted the job. However, assuming that Aphra was attempting to acquire the beast for a collection that would rival that of King Prana's, Squoxx planned to kill the creature instead.\nWhile hunting the Shadowfang Beast, Squoxx was attacked, and the creature ripped off his lekku, which meant that he would die within an hour. He hid in a cave, managing to avoid being spotted by the beast. Two of his rivals, Nokk and Winloss encountered him, and pretended to help Squoxx so that they could use him as bait for the creature. They tied him up and threw him into the path of the Shadowfang Beast, but the creature was unable to locate him as it only navigated through sound. Winloss and Nokk managed to incapacitate the beast with an electro cudgel, and Aphra tried to make them kill it so that she could escape. While they threatened to shoot it with a crossbow, neither of them did, throwing the weapon behind them. Squoxx, still lying on the ground, lifted the crossbow and shot the beast, killing it. At the same time, he died of his injuries, collapsing back onto the floor of the cave.\nExtremely loyal to King Prana, Squoxx would rather sabotage his hunting mission than let what he believed to be a competing crime syndicate outdo his employer. Despite this, Nokk and Winloss were able to trick Squoxx into thinking that they would help, allowing them to sacrifice him as bait for the Shadowfang Beast. Even as he was dying, he still took the opportunity to kill the beast.\nSquoxx was a skilled hunter, whose talents were respected enough by King Prana that he was considered to be his top henchman. Winloss and Nokk saw him as competition, and Aphra claimed that his death left them as the best hunters in the sector.\nSquoxx first appeared in the canon comic Doctor Aphra Annual 2, written by Simon Spurrier, illustrated by Caspar Wijngaard and released on September 5 2018.",
