 "content": "Hayde Gofai was a female Human and a patron of the Outlander Club on Coruscant. She was a thrill-seeking club-hopper who often attempted to catch the eye of prospective partners, including Jedi Anakin Skywalker during his pursuit of bounty hunter Zam Wesell in 22 BBY.\nHayde Gofai was played by Australian actress and model Fiona Johnson who was uncredited in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. She is also notable for her role as \"the Woman in the Red Dress\" in the 1999 science fiction film The Matrix. The actress, in costume, introduced the first episode of the Episode II behind-the-scenes video series on location, and then the eighth episode alongside the actress playing Sne Wo and an unidentified club patron.",
