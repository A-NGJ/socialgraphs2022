 "content": "Gilsaria was a female Human witch of the Singing Mountain Clan who lived on Dathomir during the time of the Galactic Civil War, a major conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Gilsaria fought and died in a skirmish against a spacer who wished to obtain her Shard of Hatred.\nGilsaria was a female Human who belonged to a group of witches known as the Singing Mountain Clan. Gilsaria worked alongside her clan at their stronghold on the Singing Mountain, a geographic feature of the Outer Rim world of Dathomir. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a treacherous Nightsister by the name of Axkva Min attempted to escape from her prison in the Chamber of Banishment, located deep within the Rancor Cave just nearby the Nightsister Stronghold. Meanwhile, a spacer worked alongside two important residents of a Dathomiri township known as Aurilia. They were a Zabrak named Captain Sarguillo, and the Human founder of Aurilia named Rohak. Rohak and Sarguillo informed the spacer that the only way to stop Axkva Min would be to gain access to her Chamber of Banishment by using the Key of Exile. However, the key had to be specially created by relying on The Force to fuse four special shards; the Shard of Indifference, Obedience, Pity, and Hatred.\nAs it turned out, Gilsaria possessed the Shard of Hatred, without which the spacer could not succeed in entering Axkva Min's chamber. Because of this, the spacer traveled to the Singing Mountain Clan Stronghold, outside of which existed a large gong. The spacer sounded the gong, alerting the clan to the existence of the intruder. The spacer was met first by a Singing Mountain clan guardian, arch witch, and dragoon, all of which were defeated. Following their deaths, Gilsaria engaged the spacer in combat. Despite being skilled in combat, Gilsaria was no match for the spacer, and was killed. The Shard of Hatred was retrieved from her dead body, allowing the spacer to continue their mission to fuse the shards into the Key of Exile.\nGilsaria was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Gilsaria was added to the game along with the \"Axkva Min\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 7\" update, on November 1, 2007.",
