 "content": "Skot OnSon was a Human male from Ord Cestus who served as the youngest member of the terrorist group known as Desert Wind. He was tall and thin, with long blond hair and a crescent-shaped scar on his forehead. His family lived near Kibo Sands, and had its water supply cut off by the Five Families. Around 22 BBY., Skot OnSon participated in the Battle of Ord Cestus against the Confederacy of Independent Systems and was later killed. It was rumored that he was close friends with the leader of Desert Wind, Thak Val Zsing.\nSkot OnSon was named after Scott Sonnon, a friend of author Steven Barnes.",
