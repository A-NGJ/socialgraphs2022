 "content": "Finn Ertay was a Twi'lek female who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi during the Clone Wars. Ertay and a Kajain'sa'Nikto Jedi encountered the brothers Maul and Savage Opress on a spaceport somewhere in the Outer Rim Territories. The two Jedi engaged Maul and Opress in a lightsaber duel, where Ertay was impaled by Maul while attempting to save the life of her comrade, who died shortly afterwards.\nFinn Ertay was a Twi'lek Jedi who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, Finn Ertay was present at the Jedi Temple's communication center, where she watched a message from Separatist General Grievous alongside other Jedi. Ertay stood to the left of the Mon Calamari Jedi Eekar Oki, and watched as Grievous tortured Jedi Master Eeth Koth. She, Oki, and several others left the room soon after after Grand Master Yoda dismissed the Jedi younglings.\nIn 20 BBY, Ertay was present at a landing pad at the Temple's exterior standing next to Oki and several Wookiees. There, she welcomed back Jedi trainees Jinx, O-Mer, and Ahsoka Tano, who had been rescued from Wasskah by the Wookiee General Tarfful and returned to the temple aboard the Halo, the bounty hunter Sugi's starship.\nBetween 20 and 19 BBY, Ertay and a Nikto Jedi dueled former Sith Lord Maul and his brother Savage Opress at an Outer Rim spaceport. The Nikto was injured by Opress and Ertay rolled underneath Maul to aid her ally and block Opress' strike, however Maul impaled her through her exposed back and killed her. Ertay's comrade was also killed shortly afterwards.\nFinn Ertay had blue eyes and green skin. Ertay was in close proximity with high-ranking Jedi Masters such as Mace Windu and Grand Master Yoda when she was at the temple. When she saw her fellow Jedi in danger during their fight with the brothers, she quickly broke off her fight with Maul to defend him, which cost her her life when Maul stabbed her from behind.\nFinn Ertay possessed skill in lightsaber combat, managing to briefly defend herself against Maul and Savage Opress. Ertay was somewhat athletic and fast, being able to slide in between Maul's legs to block a blow from Savage that would have killed her comrade, but her skill was not sufficient to save her life or defeat her opponents.\nFinn Ertay wielded a blue lightsaber while in combat, and wore brown Jedi robes in combat and at the Jedi Temple. She also wore headgear which covered most of her head, save for her lekku, but including her ear-cones.\nFinn Ertay first appeared, albeit unnamed, in \"Grievous Intrigue,\" the ninth episode of the second season of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, which first aired on January 1, 2010. Ertay was identified by name in the episode's accompanying episode guide on StarWars.com, in its \"Trivia \u0026 Details\" section.",
