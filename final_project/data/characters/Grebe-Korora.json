 "content": "Grebe-Korora was a male Lanai porter who resided on the planet Ahch-To. Hailing from Temple Island, he was a member of the group known as the Visitors, along with all the other male members of his species from the island. The group spent almost all of their time traveling to other islands across the planet's oceans on a fleet of handcrafted vessels, fishing and hunting in order to feed the female Lanais back at their home. When Grebe-Korora and the other Visitors did return once each month they and the females would celebrate a Festival of Return, in which they danced and amended old relationships for several days before the males returned to their travels. Korora wore a brown robe with a light brown belt and fingerless gloves and a blue scarf beneath a flat hat tied on with string. Grebe-Korora had gray and white skin.\nGrebe-Korora was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release. Despite this, the character still appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film on December 15, 2017. He is a playable character in the 2022 Traveller's Tales video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.",
