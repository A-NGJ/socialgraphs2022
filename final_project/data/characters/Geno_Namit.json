 "content": "Geno Namit was a human male who served as a captain in the naval forces of the Resistance during their war against the First Order. During the attack on the Resistance fleet by the First Order following the evacuation from the planet D'Qar in the year 34 ABY, he served under Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo on the Free Virgillia-class Bunkerbuster Ninka. When the primary bridge of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus was destroyed, killing almost all of Resistance High Command and injuring General Leia Organa, Namit joined Holdo and several other officers loyal to her in transferring to the Raddus so that the vice admiral could take command of the fleet as the highest ranking officer still able to command. Captain Namit survived the Battle of Oetchi and made it to Crait, whereupon he managed to escape alongside other members of the Resistance in the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Crait.\nHe wore a brown brismoss-fiber uniform tunic with dark brown pants, brown boots, and a belt where he holstered a Glie-44 blaster pistol. Namit's skin was fair in color and his hair was brown.\nGeno Namit was portrayed by Hugh Skinner in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. The character was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
