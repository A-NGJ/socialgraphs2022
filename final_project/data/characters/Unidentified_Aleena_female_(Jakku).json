 "content": "A female Aleena was a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku in 34 ABY. A mother of two, she was looking for rations in Kelvin Ravine to help feed her family. When BB-8 was passing through the area to seek a ship off planet, she asked the droid for help in finding food. The droid recalled a supply of rations in a crashed starship he spent the previous night in and led the family to it.",
