 "content": "Carac, also known as \"Iceheart Carac\", was a male Human pirate captain living during the Galactic War. His nickname was given to him by the Galactic Republic in light of his merciless methods and attitude. Around 3640 BBY he became an officer of the Voidwolf's personal strike fleet and later volunteered himself to command it. After the Voidwolf got killed by a smuggler, Iceheart Carac pledged himself to the newly proclaimed Voidhound.",
