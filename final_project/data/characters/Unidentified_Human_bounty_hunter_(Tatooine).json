 "content": "This Human male was a bounty hunter, and present at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine around 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars. The individual was part of a cadre of bounty hunters searching for a bounty with good pay, and happened upon Savage Opress.\nA Human male, this individual entered a life of crime as a bounty hunter, and around 21 BBY was present at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. He stood alongside four other bounty huntersâ€”one male and one female Weequay, a member of a species with distinctive facial tentacles, and a female Human.\nThis bounty hunter had a laugh after the male Weequay told a bartending droid to \"shut its speakers,\" and was observing as the member of the unknown species was scrolled through a list of the latest bounties. The five hunters happened upon the bounty for Savage Opress, who was worth the most credits at one million.\nThe male Weequay expressed his surprise, asking who Opress was, before this bounty hunter announced that they would take the bounty. Before the hunter could finish his sentence, the former Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress stepped in and said that this one was for her. Ventress walked up to the screen, pushing the hunter out of the way, and then transferred Opress's bounty to her comlink.\nThis bounty hunter had a determined personality when it came to getting a bounty, and was the first of his group of bounty hunters to offer to take upon Savage Opress's bounty. He had a bald head, blue eyes, tan skin, and wore a blue shirt and pants while on Tatooine.",
