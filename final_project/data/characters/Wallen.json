 "content": "Wallen was a Human male stormtrooper who held the rank of sergeant, and was assigned to Colonel Dyer's command on the Forest Moon of Endor in 4 ABY during the construction of the second Death Star prior to the Battle of Endor. Governor Yount of the Wakeelmui garrison recommended his unit to Commander Igar of the Imperial Army unit Tempest Force. Wallen and another stormtrooper were present in a landing station on the moon when Commander Igar brought Rebel Commander Luke Skywalker to Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader during the early stages of the Battle of Endor. After a conversation between Vader and Skywalker, Wallen escorted the Rebel to Vader's Lambda-class shuttle ST 321, bound for the orbiting Death Star.\nThe Human male Sergeant Wallen was among the stormtroopers under the command of Colonel Dyer who were stationed on the Forest Moon of Endor during the construction of the orbiting second Death Star in the year 4 ABY. His unit was recommended to Commander Igar of the Imperial Army unit Tempest Force by Governor Yount of the Wakeelmui garrison.\nDuring the early stages of the Battle of Endor, Wallen and another stormtrooper were present at a landing station on the moon when Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived from his Lambda-class shuttle ST 321. The pair of troopers accompanied Darth Vader down a turbolift, and waited inside the lift as the Dark Lord went to meet Commander Igar, who brought recently captured Rebel Commander and Jedi Luke Skywalker to Lord Vader. After a conversation between the Dark Lord and the Rebel, Vader motioned for Wallen and the other trooper to escort Skywalker into the lift and bring the captive to the shuttle, which then brought both the Dark Lord and the Rebel to the Death Star.\nWallen wore full white stormtrooper armor. He wielded a standard E-11 blaster rifle.\nWallen first appeared as an unnamed character in the Return of the Jedi novel and the film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, in which an unidentified extra portrayed his character. He was given a name and brief backstory in the 1999 Endor Limited edition of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
