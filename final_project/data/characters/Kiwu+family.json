 "content": "The Kiwu Family was one of the forty Great Families of the Chiss Ascendancy, the nation of the Chiss species. Senior Captain Kiwu'tro'owmis \"Wutroow\" was a member of the family who served in Admiral Ar'alani's Picket Force Six in the Expansionary Defense Fleet aboard the Nightdragon man-of-war Vigilant. Around 19 BBY, following Picket Force Six's attack on the Paataatus species, a Kiwu syndic was present at the tribunal for Wutroow and Ar'alani, where they answered questions about Senior Captain Thrawn's role in the battle.\nAround 18 BBY, during the warlike Grysk species' coordinator Jixtus's plot to destroy the Ascendancy, Expansionary Defense Fleet Supreme General Ba'kif noted that the Kiwu family had taken a neutral stance in the crisis in the Chiss nation. As such, he asked Wutroow to speak to Roscu, a captain in the Chiss Clarr family's fleet, after the latter had refused to speak to crewmembers of the Vigilant regarding her presence over the planet Sposia.\nThe Kiwu family first appeared in the 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, the first volume of The Ascendancy Trilogy by Timothy Zahn.",
