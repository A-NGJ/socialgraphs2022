 "content": "Kralla was a female Felucian that lived on Felucia during the Clone Wars. She had a rancor she loved. One day, soldiers of the Confederacy of Independent Systems attacked and destroyed her village. She was one of the few survivors, and to protect her rancor, told him to leave.\nLater, she met the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi during a mission on Felucia.\nKralla is first identified in Downhill, in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.43. In this comic, she refers to her rancor and the destruction of her village. This corresponds to the young Felucian that can be seen in Kinect Star Wars, in the Rancor Rampage activity. In addition, both have exactly the same clothing, confirming that Kralla is the same person.",
