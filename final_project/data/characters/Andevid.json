 "content": "Andevid was a male Aqualish pirate who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter his captain lost a reckless game played by pirate boss Aral tukor Viest, Andevid was more or less voluntarily placed in Viest's service and acted from then on as his personal bodyguard. In the year 2 ABY, the rebels Leia Organa, Han Solo, Sian Tesar and the crew of the Aegis also fell into the clutches of Viest. The Aqualishan saw the rebels as a chance to escape from Viest's headquarters and open up a new perspective. He joined the group around Princess Leia and successfully escaped with them. He later helped repel Imperial officer Degoren, who was targeting the rebels. Andevid ultimately turned down an offer from Leia to join the rebellion and went on to go his own way.",
