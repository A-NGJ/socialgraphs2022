 "content": "Augustus Tryll was a Human male with a widespread reputation as a slaver and criminal during the era of the Galactic Republic. Tryll was once a passenger aboard a pleasure cruiser that fell under attack by pirates in the Merson asteroid belt, but Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi stepped up to foil the pirates' plans. Immediately afterward, Kenobi had to come to Tryll's defense, protecting the man from an angry mob that accused him of being in league with the pirates.\nA Human male, Augustus Tryll had, by the later years of the Galactic Republic, earned a reputation as a notorious criminal with dealings in slavery, theft and political betrayal. At some point, Tryll was forced to flee a planet to avoid arrest by law enforcement, taking flight on a pleasure cruiser under the command of Captain Quasar headed for Alderaan. During the trip, Tryll made the acquaintance of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was also aboard the cruiser, and attempted to obtain Kenobi's help on a venture that he wanted to recruit people with \"unusual talents\" for. Kenobi, well-aware of Tryll's criminal proclivities, declined the offer.\nSoon afterward, Quasar's cruiser came under attack by pirates in the Merson asteroid belt, forcing Kenobi to step in and take command. Kenobi's efforts helped repel the pirates, but word filtered out to the passengers that the bridge believed that their attackers had been following a signal coming from within the ship itself. Tryll, as a well-known criminal, immediately fell under suspicion from the riled-up crowd, who threatened him. Although Kenobi had his own doubts about the scoundrel, he felt that it was his duty to step in and protect Tryll, as the raging mob had no actual proof that he was at fault. Kenobi soon saved Tryll's skin when he recognized that it was actually a faulty fermentation device at the ship's bar sending out the signal, and the Jedi destroyed the machine and ended the threat of any further attacks.\nA cocksure criminal, Tryll was confident enough to attempt to rope Obi-Wan Kenobi, a noted Jedi Knight, into one of his schemes. However, Tryll's composure went away when his fellow passengers accused him of being in league with the Merson pirates, causing him to beg for Kenobi's help. Tryll had a strong taste for Deltron spice wine, drinking it often during his trip on Quasar's pleasure cruiser.\nTryll made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Star Wars  24, written by Mary Jo Duffy and released in 1979. Tryll was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
