 "content": "Ferrika Lazerra was born on the polluted planet of Balosar and out of eight brothers and sisters, she was the only child to survive. She got off the planet as soon as possible, by stowing away on a ship.\nShe ended up at Point Nadir when the refugee ship on which she stowed away was captured by pirates. Lazerra slipped into the shadowport unseen and quickly found her place among the city's scum. She started as a fence and spice dealer, but soon began to specialize in spice only, which drew the attention of Tirello Anjiliac; and being a survivor, Lazerra decided to join the Hutts' criminal syndicate.\nLazerra cared only for her own concerns, and viewed others as either potential enemies or tools to be used. She ran the black market shop named Void Imports.",
