 "content": "Glynn-Beti was a female Bothan Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Bothan, Glynn-Beti was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually ascending to the rank of Jedi Master. Taking on the young Ulu Ulix as her Padawan, both were called upon to take up ranks in the Grand Army of the Republic when the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems went to war.\nMaster Glynn-Beti and her Padawan joined CT-4/619 in battling for Raxus Prime. There, the Jedi discovered Count Dooku, leader of the CIS, attempting to harness the powers of a construct known as the Force Harvester. While the Jedi were unable to capture Dooku, they destroyed the potential weapon and sabotaged the Dark Reaper campaign. Discovering the orphaned Boba Fett during the battle, Master Glynn-Beti failed to recognize the dangerous child and had him shipped to Bespin to be placed with a local family there. However, Fett managed to escape, joining forces with the notorious Aurra Sing, a failed Jedi Glynn-Beti detested.\nMaster Glynn-Beti was present on Bespin to defend it from Separatist invasion. However, the best she could do was assist with an evacuation of Cloud City.\nGlynn-Beti and Boba Fett would once more cross paths when she led the campaign known as the Battle of Xagobah. During the battle she thanked the mysterious Fett when he saved the life of Padawan Ulix, stating she was in his debt. In payment of that debt, Master Glynn-Beti assisted Fett in infiltrating the Mazariyan Citadel as part of the overall mission to capture one of the Confederacy's leaders, Wat Tambor.",
