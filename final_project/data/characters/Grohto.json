 "content": "Grohto was a male Ishi Tib Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Ishi Tib, Grohto was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic; obtaining the rank of Jedi Master and constructing a green-bladed lightsaber. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Grohto took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. When the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Maul resurfaced during the war, Grohto was assigned to a strike team tasked with hunting down Maul and his brother, Savage Opress. Along with Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bruu Jun-Fan and Ko Solok, Grohto journeyed across the Republic following reports of the two Zabraks' deeds. Confronting the dark-siders on Yellowblade's Landing, Grohto was killed by Maul's lightsaber, sustaining a fatal blow to the abdomen after the Zabrak distracted the Jedi by using a Human woman as a living shield.",
