 "content": "Drophan was a male Massassi warrior serving under the Sith Lord Saes Rrogon aboard the dreadnaught Harbinger prior to the Great Hyperspace War. In 5000 BBY, shortly before the outbreak of the war, Harbinger and another ship, Omen, were tasked with harvesting Lignan—an ore powerful in the dark side of the Force—on Phaegon III's largest moon. However, the Jedi Master Relin Druur infiltrated Harbinger in an attempt to sabotage the ship. He was confronted by Drophan, who interrogated Druur and intended to report the intruder. Druur then attacked Drophan, decapitating him with his lightsaber before the Massassi could make the report.\nDrophan was a male Massassi who lived during the time leading up to the Great Hyperspace War. He served as a security officer under the Kaleesh Sith Lord Saes Rrogon, aboard Rrogon's ship, the Sith dreadnaught Harbinger. In 5000 BBY, Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow sent Harbinger and another Sith dreadnaught, Omen, on a mission to find Lignan, a rare ore that was very powerful in the dark side of the Force, for use during the Sith Empire's upcoming invasion of the Galactic Republic.\nThe Sith eventually located a large deposit of Lignan on the largest moon of Phaegon III in the Phaegon system. As Harbinger and Omen harvested the ore, they were ambushed by a Jedi Infiltrator starfighter. While Harbinger sent ten Blade-class starfighters to assail the fighter, a Jedi Master, Relin Druur, infiltrated Harbinger in an attempt to sabotage the ship's hyperdrive, using the Force to hide himself from the perceptions of the beings he met.\nJust outside the ship's landing bay, Drophan noticed Druur before the Jedi Master was able to blind him to his appearance. Druur claimed that there was trouble in the landing bay, but the Massassi, suspicious of the Jedi Master's flexsuit—a type of environmental suit—inquired as to who his superior was. When Druur gave no answer, Drophan pushed him up against the wall and began to report the interloper's presence via comlink, but Druur cut him off by claiming that his superior was Memit Nadill. Drophan was unfamiliar with the name, and Druur informed him that Nadill was a Jedi Master on the planet Kirrek.\nFinally realizing the threat that Druur presented, Drophan moved to attack, but Druur pushed him across the corridor and into a wall. Drophan attempted to lunge at Druur with his lanvarok weapon, but the Jedi severed Drophan's arm and then cut off the Massassi's head. Drophan's body was soon discovered and reported to Colonel Los Dor on Harbinger's bridge, who in turn reported the finding to Rrogon. Knowing that the lightsaber cuts on Drophan's body meant that there was a Jedi aboard, Rrogon decided to hunt the Jedi down and present him as a gift to Sadow.\nDrophan was muscular and spoke in a guttural voice. He wore metal ornamentation on his nose and ears, and also had studs implanted beneath the skin of his forearms, scalp, and biceps. The Massassi carried a lanvarok slung over his back and a blaster on his thigh.\nDrophan was suspicious of Relin Druur after finding the Jedi and decided to report him. However, Druur was able to distract the Massassi by claiming that his superior was Memit Nadill. Drophan was taken aback, and when Druur told him that Nadill was a Jedi Master, Drophan was too surprised and incredulous to react right away. However, he soon registered the significance of what Druur had said and attacked the Jedi.\nDrophan appeared briefly as a minor character in Paul S. Kemp's debut Star Wars novel, Crosscurrent, released January 26, 2010.",
