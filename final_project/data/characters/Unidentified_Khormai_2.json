 "content": "A Khormai was present in the casino in Attuma Duum's headquarters on an asteroid near Cavamina Minor c. 21 BBY along with another member of the Khormai species. Their position placed them at the site of the destruction of Galactic Republic and Separatist flotillas that had been lured into the mined asteroid field by Duum. When a Human named Shon-Ju infiltrated Duum's base and disabled its shields, however, the station itself came under threat of the mined asteroids and was destroyed.",
