 "content": "Kea Ra-Lan was a female Gran thief who operated during the reign of the New Republic. She owned a retreat in the Dal forests of the planet Kinyen.\nRa-Lan was a prolific thief, despite her refusal to fight anybody, including security forces that were attempting to apprehend her. This passivity would often lead her to getting reduced sentences for her crimes. The thief started her career shortly after the Battle of Yavin. She broke through a blockade around the planet Kassyyyk and made her way to Kamarkiia on the island of Wartaki. There, she broke into the secret vaults of Neocomora and stole ancient religious texts that had been thought destroyed. The Wookiee ambassador Kerrithrarr offered a 50,000 credit reward for her capture.\nRa-Lan was very pacifistic and would not harm living beings or droids.",
