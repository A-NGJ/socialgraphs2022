 "content": "Jorg was a human male who lived on Batuu during the war between the Resistance and the First Order. Jorg offered to sell a backpack used by the rebels on Hoth to the collector Dok-Ondar, claiming it was one of only two that survived the Battle of Hoth. However, Dok-Ondar knew Jorg was lying, and that many more similar backpacks existed, and the collector told Jorg to sell it elsewhere.",
