 "content": "Eskella Gryton was a Human female Sith Acolyte of the Sith Academy during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She was the daughter of Tremel, an Overseer of the Sith Academy on Korriban. After Darth Baras' apprentice killed her father, she tried to avenge him, but was quickly defeated by the Sith Warrior.\nIf the warrior chose to spare her father after their inevitable duel, it is possible to avoid a conflict with Eskella by telling her that her father is alive. Regardless of the warrior's advice, she decides to hunt him down, wherever he's hiding. Once she has found him, Tremel will be forced to kill his own daughter, blaming Baras for what he put them both through.",
