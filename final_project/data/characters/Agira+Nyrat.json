 "content": "Agira Nyrat was a female human member of the Zealots of Psusan who was present in the Outlander Club on Coruscant some time prior to the First Battle of Geonosis. She identified a weak-minded individual in the club and attempted to make him join the fast-growing cult she was a member of. She had brown hair, fair skin, and a tattoo over her navel. She wore a flamboyant red outfit to the club.\nNyrat first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, and was identified in Star Wars: Complete Locations. At least one edition of that book incorrectly gives her name as \"Nyrat Agira,\" which was her name in the Legends continuity.",
