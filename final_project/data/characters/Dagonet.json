 "content": "Dagonet was a human male who served as a senator in the Galactic Republic. At some point, when Qui-Gon Jinn was a Padawan, senator Dagonet's son was kidnapped, and Jinn and his master, Jedi Knight Dooku, went to a planet to rescue the teenager, when they discovered the reasons of the kidnappers. Dagonet had already sent his forces, though, and was ruthless with the civilians. At some point, Dooku decides to take matters in his hands and uses Force choke on the arrogant senator. Alarmed, Qui-Gon attempts to stop him, but Dooku sends him flying to the door by using Force push. Dooku nearly killed Dagonet, but the belligerent senator's son and the Jedi's padawan were able to save him.",
