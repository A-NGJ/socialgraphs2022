 "content": "Honesty Weft was a human male, the son of the Dalnan ambassador Weft. He was present aboard the starship Steady Wing, headed for the Starlight Beacon. As he was the same age as Avon Starros, an aspiring inventor and the daughter of Galactic Republic Senator Ghirra Starros, Avon's minder Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh was asked to bring her along onboard the Steady Wing from Port Haileap by Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale, as Sunvale hoped that Avon would befriend Honesty and hopefully soften the Dalnans' view of the Republic. However, during the journey to the space station's dedication ceremony, bombs went off onboard the cruiser, and while the older Jedi fought to save the ship, Honesty, along with Avon, Rwoh, Padawan Imri Cantaros, and Avon's protocol droid J-6, evacuated in a shuttle. The group was subsequently stranded on the wild jungle moon Wevo.\nHonesty was not enthusiastic about his presence as part of the delegation, preferring to have remained on Dalna in order to undergo the Metamorphosis Trials, a rite of passage undertaken by all Dalnan younglings in order to determine whether or not they would succeed in their chosen life paths; in Honesty's case, he aspired to become a combat medic. Under pressure from his mother, a Corellian who did not share the typical Dalnan aversion to space travel, Honesty reluctantly acquiesced but was not good-natured about it and squabbled with his father on at least one occasion after they boarded the Steady Wing. He was subsequently left riddled with guilt and grief when his father perished in the Steady Wing's destruction, mourning that their last conversation had been a negative one. It was Honesty who managed to work out how the native animals kept themselves hydrated in spite of the moon's acidic rainfall, namely by eating fruits filled with nourishing liquid.\nHonesty was enraged to discover that agents of the Nihil, a pirate organization who had been wreaking murderous havoc throughout the Dalnan sector and the galaxy at large, were responsible for the Steady Wing's destruction and death of his father. His anger and desire for revenge resonated with Padawan Cantaros, who was similarly affected by the death of his Master and who convinced Honesty to join him in an attempt to kill the pirates who had followed them to Wevo. Though both boys were easily captured, they were soon freed by Vernestra and J-6 who subdued the pirates; unfortunately, Cantaros had danced dangerously close to the dark side of the Force and Vernestra was forced to subdue him after a brief duel. After being rescued by a Jedi/Republic task force, Honesty requested that Avon petition her mother to let him speak to the Galactic Senate about the threat the Nihil represented and possibly open negotiations to Dalna joining the Republic.",
