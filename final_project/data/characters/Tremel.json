 "content": "Tremel was a male Human Sith Overseer at the Sith Academy, on Korriban. During the Cold War, he was tasked in selecting worthy acolytes to become Sith. He was responsible for the arrival and initiation of a promising acolyte, who would become his protégé.\nFor decades between the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, Tremel administered the trials to acolytes that proved themselves worthy to join the Sith. He made these trials very difficult so those who were strong would survive and the weak would not.\nTremel was directly involved in selecting and preparing a promising new acolyte to be a rival to Vemrin, an acolyte seeking to become the new apprentice powerful Sith Lord Darth Baras. Tremel considered Vemrin to be an \"impure\" Sith, as Vemrin had come from Balmorra rather than the old Sith Worlds, and Vemrin's family had no history of Sith lineage or even Force-sensitivity. To ensure Vemrin's rival would succeed, Tremel summoned the acolyte to Korriban ahead of schedule.\nTremel's unwillingness to adapt would prove to be his undoing, as Baras commanded his new apprentice to assassinate him. In the following duel, Tremel was outmatched and struck down by his former protégé, the latter bringing the former's hand back to Baras as proof of his death. Tremel's daughter, Eskella Gryton, was also slain later by Baras's apprentice after she tried to exact revenge for her father's demise. His protégé would eventually win Baras's favor, dueling and killing Vemrin when confronted inside the Tomb of Naga Sadow.\nTremel was a calm and collected man, a loyal subject to the Empire. He was displeased with the academy's policy for admittance, and in a broader scope, with the directions taken by the Empire during its conflict with the Galactic Republic. His reluctance to embrace these changes was shown to be a major reason behind Baras's decision to have him assassinated.\nTremel was proficient with his single-bladed Sith lightsaber which he used in combat. Tremel had some power with the dark side of the Force as well.\nTremel is voiced by Paul Darrow in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Darrow passed away on June 3, 2019.\nThe Warrior can choose to either kill or spare Tremel. If killed, Eskella would attempt to avenge her father, only to be slain. If the Warrior spared his life then eventually an enraged Eskella found Tremel in hiding, she attacked him and Tremel was forced to kill his own daughter. Only then did he wish revenge on Baras for what he had done to him.\nHe would later come out of hiding at the request of Darth Vowrawn to bear witness to his student defeating Darth Baras and ending his claim as the Voice of the Emperor.",
