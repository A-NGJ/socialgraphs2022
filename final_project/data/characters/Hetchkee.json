 "content": "Hetchkee was a male Kel Dor Lieutenant who served in the military during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nPrior to his promotion, he held the rank of Private and served as a guard to Envoy Ula Vii on Nal Hutta in 3643 BBY. After forming an alliance with the Sith Empire to lead an attack against the Hexes on the planet Sebaddon, he was promoted to Lieutenant. After the meeting, he and Larin Moxla were called in by Major Cha where they were provided with arms and ammunition. Hetchkee approached Moxla just before the battle, noting that she was acting strange. She stated that nothing was wrong; in fact, she had just kissed Shigar Konshi, who had told her he did not share her feelings. Hetchkee fought during Independent Operation Sebaddon, wearing armor with green lieutenant's markings. Along with Moxla and Ses Jopp, Hetchkee survived the battle.",
