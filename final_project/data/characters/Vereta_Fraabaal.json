 "content": "Vereta Fraabaal was a female Sith apprentice in the time of the Cold War. Born as a Force-sensitive daughter of Admiral Fraabaal, Vereta was trained as a Sith on Dromund Kaas, eventually becoming an apprentice of the Sith Lord, Grathan.\nAfter Lord Grathan's decision to go rogue, Vereta remained loyal to him, one of many apprentices withstanding the siege of his estate by the Imperial Military.\nHer father decided to hire a bounty hunter, the future Grand Champion of the Great Hunt, to kill her due to the political implications of Grathan's betrayal. The bounty hunter found her and engaged the Sith Acolyte in a duel. Vereta was defeated, shocked that she could be beaten by a being who was not Force-sensitive. She realized her folly in following Grathan's ways, and realized that her master had lied to her about her strength.\nStill in disbelief that she could be defeated by a common bounty hunter, the hunter killed her.\nLike many Sith, Vereta was very confident in her abilities in the dark side. She was also very loyal to Grathan even after he went rogue. She believed that common bounty hunters couldn't kill Sith.\nDespite her strength and confidence, she knew she wasn't invincible. She admitted that she could be killed by a more powerful Sith, a lucky Jedi, or an explosion, but not by a bounty hunter.\nVereta also considered imprisonment worse than death.\nBeing Sith and a Sorcerer, she was skilled in lightsaber combat, but her true power was with her skill in the Force, as she could use Force lightning and even use Force storm.\nIn the light side option, the bounty hunter freezes Vereta in carbonite and takes her to her father instead of killing her. This is an act the Sith apprentice sees as a fate worse than death. Mako will favor that option. Upon returning to Admiral Fraabaal, he is at first dismayed about having Verata brought to him alive though he thanks the hunter after expressing regret at trying to have her killed. He plans to have her locked until she comes to her senses.",
