 "content": "Lohgarra was a female Wookiee who was captain of the cargo transport known as the Mighty Oak Apocalypse . Lohgarra transported only legal cargo, but she operated on the fringes, where Imperial oversight was rarely an issue. Seven months after the Battle of Yavin, Logharra hired Thane Kyrell as a copilot and navigator. Some time after Thane had joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Logharra decided to assist the Rebellion as well. The Mighty Oak Apocalypse joined the Alliance Fleet and docked aboard the Liberty before the Battle of Endor. After the destruction of the second Death Star, Lohgarra was seen celebrating the victory over Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor. After the Battle of Endor, she used credits that were given out by the newly formed New Republic to species affected by war crimes to upgrade her ship.\nLohgarra was known to have spent two centuries serving as a ship captain who owned a freighter called the Mighty Oak Apocalypse . By the time of the reign of the Galactic Empire, she was one of the few Wookiees to have escaped the enslavement of her homeworld of Kashyyyk at the hands of the Empire. She recalled that Kashyyyk had once been a paradise but that the Empire had turned the planet into a \"hell.\" Her crew members included a purple and black JJH2 model astromech droid JJH2, the Tarsunt engineer Brill, and the Ithorian maintenance officer Methwat Tann. Lohgarra and her crew spend much of their time transporting legal cargo through the Outer Rim Territories and the Expansion Region.\nSeven months after the Battle of Yavin, the former TIE fighter pilot Thane Kyrell found work as a copilot and navigator. Thane had left the Empire after witnessing the Empire's destruction of Alderaan and the maltreatment of Bodach'i slaves on Kerev Doi. While Kyrell never told Lohgarra that he was an Imperial deserter, she realized who he was but did not hold it against Thane. For several months, Thane worked for Lohgarra. After Thane found that they could not recharge the ship's power cell, she allowed him to buy a new power cell on Zeitooine but warned him that the planet was not known as a cheap place. While visiting Zeitooine, Thane witnessed the Empire arrest of a local family and forgot to buy the power cell.\nEighteen months after the events on Yavin, Lohgarra and her crew delivered medical supplies to the planet Oulanne, which had been struck by a massive earthquake. As they entered the planet's atmosphere, Thane reported that they were approaching a megahurricane covering a good quarter of the land area. Despite the rough conditions and the Moa being heavily laden with cargo, Thane managed to convince Lohgarra to let him land the ship. Against the odds, Thane managed to land the Moa. Lohgarra congratulated Thane for his efforts and hugged him tightly. As a sign of praise and affection, she also started grooming him.\nWhile on Oulanne, Thane met the Rebel Alliance pilot Wedge Antilles, who convinced him to join the Rebel Alliance. After some discussion, Thane managed to convince Lohgarra to let him leave and join the rebel group. While Lohgarra was initially hesitant to lose her copilot and navigator, she relented after recalling that her own people had been enslaved by the Empire and that Kashyyyk, so beautiful in her youth, had been turned into a literal hell. When Thane told her about his lover Ciena Ree who was still in the Imperial Navy, Lohgarra remarked that the Force had a way of bringing people together when the time was right. Thane then took it that Lohgarra was happy for him to join the Rebellion.\nShortly before the dogfight in the Hudalla system, Lohgarra and her crew decided to join the Rebel Alliance. She landed the Moa on the planet 5251977. While Lohgarra hugged Thane, Brill informed the rebel pilot that they had refitted the Moa with new shields, dampeners, and guns. Prior to the Battle of Endor, Lohgarra and her crew met with Thane at the hangar of the MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser Home One. She also lent her astromech droid to the rebel pilot Yendor, who was a member of Thane's Corona Squadron. Lohgarra and her crew took part in the Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of Emperor Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, and afterwards joined the mass celebration in Bright Tree Village, where she was observed to be \"outdrinking an entire squadron\".\nFollowing the establishment of the New Republic, Lohgarra received reparations from the new government as part of a program to compensate species enslaved by the Empire. Lohgarra used these funds to buy new engines for the Mighty Oak Apocalypse.\nLohgarra was an elderly female Wookiee with white fur that was once brown. Her eyes were once dark blue but had gone slightly milky white by the time of the Battle of Endor. As a Wookiee, Lohgarra spoke only Shyriiwook. Despite her old age, Lohgarra's vision and mind remained sharp. Unlike most freighter pilots and owners, her shipping jobs were never motivated by a quest for riches but by her character; a lucrative run of luxury goods could be followed by a zero-sum haul of emergency generators to a troubled outpost or medical supplies to a devastated region. Lohgarra viewed her ship and crew more like a home and family, refusing to make big decisions without first consulting them and receiving their support or dissent. She hired crew that she could trust and was known to be maternal towards crew members that she took under her wing including Thane Kyrell, indeed treating him with more affection than his own mother.\nLohgarra took a liking to Thane and was able to overlook the fact that he was a former Imperial pilot. Lohgarra developed a deep respect for Thane after he successfully landed the Moa on the planet Oulanne despite a megahurricane. Per the Wookiee custom, she hugged him and began grooming him, also regularly complaining that he looked too thin at least by her standards. While Lohgarra was reluctant to lose her copilot and navigator, she allowed Thane to join the Rebel Alliance due to her dislike of the Empire for enslaving her people. Lohgarra and her crew later joined the Rebel Alliance and took part in the Battle of Endor.\nLike others who led long lives in the galaxy, Lohgarra believed in the Force and respected its power. When Thane was agonizing to her about his fear of losing Ciena, she consoled him by stating her belief that the Force would allow their paths to cross when the time was right.\nLohgarra appeared in the Claudia Gray's 2015 junior novel Lost Stars, which was released as part of Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Her lines were told from the point of view of one of the two major protagonists, Thane Kyrell. In the video game Star Wars Battlefront II the name Lohgarra is used by the computer-controlled Wookiee warriors in single-player game modes.",
