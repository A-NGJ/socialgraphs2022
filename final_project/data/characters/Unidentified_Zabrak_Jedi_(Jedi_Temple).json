 "content": "A male Zabrak Jedi Knight served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final decades of the Republic Classic era. Stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple at the end of the Clone Wars, he defended many Jedi Initiates during Operation: Knightfall. Overpowered by the Sith Lord Darth Vader the Zabrak became one with the Force, but not before admonishing Vader—formerly the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker—that his betrayal of the Order would end up hurting the Sith Lord the most.\nA Force-sensitive Zabrak male was initiated into the Jedi Order and instructed in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Passing his Trials of Knighthood after serving as a Padawan, he obtained the rank of Jedi Knight. He was stationed at the Temple when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, indeed the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, betrayed the Jedi and ordered Operation: Knightfall be carried out in accordance with Contingency Order 66.\nWithin the Temple walls when the Grand Army attacked, the Zabrak Jedi valiantly defended a group of Jedi Initiates along the Temple's veranda. Guarding the children from clone troopers, the Jedi was outmatched when faced with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, formerly known as the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The Zabrak Jedi was struck down along with all the Initiates under his protection, dying in a small instruction room within the Temple.",
