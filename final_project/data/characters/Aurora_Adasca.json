 "content": "Aurora Adasca was a female Arkanian Jedi and the niece of Lord Arkoh Adasca, head of the Adasca Corporation. She became a scout for the Revanchist movement on the planet Serroco during the Mandalorian Wars but was left unaccounted for after Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders attacked the planet in 3963 BBY.\nThe niece of Lord Arkoh Adasca, the head of The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania, Aurora Adasca was a female Arkanian who lived in the period of time that followed the Great Sith War. As she was Force-sensitive, Aurora was taken by the Jedi Order for training, an action her uncle likened to an abduction. Arkoh Adasca never contacted her after she was taken, nor did Jedi Master Lucien Draay—a family friend of the Adascas—ever see her again, either. Aurora eventually became a Jedi scout and traveled to the planet Serroco to assist the Revanchist movement, which aimed to involve the whole Order in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. After Serroco was razed by the Mandalorians in 3963 BBY, Aurora was left unaccounted for. As she was the sole remaining heir to the House of Adasca after her uncle was killed, her disappearance enabled investors of the Draay Trust to bid for the takeover of the Adasca Corporation.\nAurora Adasca was first mentioned in the nineteenth issue of the Dark Horse comic-book series Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The issue was written by John Jackson Miller and published on August 22, 2007. It was not until 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia that the character was named.",
