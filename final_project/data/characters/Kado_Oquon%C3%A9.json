 "content": "Kado Oquoné was a human male who served as a captain in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. During the Battle of Scarif, Oquoné was in command of the Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette Lightmaker.\nAfter his ship was damaged he took it away from the line of fire to guard the line of retreat. Late in the battle, Admiral Raddus ordered Oquoné to ram his corvette into the side of a disabled Star Destroyer, causing it to crash into the second Star Destroyer and then into the Shield Gate protecting Scarif. This disabled the Shield Gate and allowed the Rebels on Scarif to transmit the Death Star plans to Raddus. The Lightmaker, along with its skeleton crew, was destroyed in the crash. Oquoné's actions resulted in the capture of the Death Star plans by the Rebels, which were later used to exploit a weakness in the battle station and destroy it during the Battle of Yavin.\nKado Oquoné was portrayed by British actor Angus Wright in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
