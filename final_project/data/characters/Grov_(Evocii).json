 "content": "Grov, also known as Grov the Destroyer, was an male Evocii gangster who rose to power on the planet Nal Hutta during the Galactic War. Grov claimed to have become a crime lord in order to inspire other Evocii to try to attain power themselves, and he called himself \"the Destroyer\" as he sought to break the Hutts' hold on the Evocii's homeworld. Grov was eventually targeted by Lo'tar, a lieutenant of one of the Hutts whom Grov attacked, and Lo'tar hired the Bounty Brokers Association to deal with Grov and his lieutenants.\nGrov first appeared in Game Update 2.3 of the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2013. He is only accessible through the Bounty Contract Week event as the Hutta Kingpin Bounty. He is voiced by Brian Bloom.",
