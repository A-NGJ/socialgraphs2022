 "content": "All-Terrain Attack Vehicle, or AT-AV for short, was the nickname of a female pittin that was a pet belonging to Tia Organa, one of Princess Leia Organa's foster aunts on Alderaan.\nAs a child, Leia had named the creature herself. AT-AV had a pale candy-pink color and was small enough to fit in Leia's cupped hands. She also liked to roll on her back and bat at Leia's braids and starblossom petals. AT-AV died in the destruction of Alderaan.",
