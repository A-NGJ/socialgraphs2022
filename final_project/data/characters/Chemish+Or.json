 "content": "Chemish Or was a Human female who served as a member of the Balmorran resistance during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. At age of eighteen, an Imperial officer cost her her right eye for \"being threatening\", forcing her to replace it with cybernetics and earning a hatred of the Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Chemish was part of an anti-Imperial terror cell operating on Balmorra, acting as second-in command below their leader, codename Gray Star. At that time, Imperial Agent Cipher Nine was attempting to infiltrate the cell to get to their leader and posed as a potential recruit with the help of Sanju Pyne, an Imperial mole. Chemish didn't trust Nine and assigned the agent to raid the Okara Droid Factory and steal some stealth power cells for bombings.\nChemish Or is voiced by Nika Futterman.",
