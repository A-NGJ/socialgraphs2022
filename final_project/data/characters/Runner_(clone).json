 "content": "Runner was a genetic clone of Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, commenced during the Thrawn campaign. He was born on an unnamed frozen moon alongside several other clones located in the Unknown Regions. Runner was one of the most devout of the clones' leader, Seer.\nIn 41 ABY, when the clones finally escaped from the moon that they had all been trapped on for years, Runner, alongside nearly all of the other clones save for Soldier, began suffering from an illness that Seer promised would be cured by the entity known as Mother. Runner died during the voyage to Mother when he got into a fight with Nyss Nenn.",
