 "content": "Deflaros was the Human male leader of a Corellian based criminal organization known as the Deflarians during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, the Deflarians hijacked a ship piloted by Captain Donovan of the CorSec and stole its cargo of weapons. They then crashed a ship of the same model than Donovan's to cover the theft of the cargo. Donovan himself was captured and imprisoned in the Deflarian bunker. CorSec Inspector Cora therefore hired a spacer to investigate the situation. The spacer managed to find the location of the bunker, infiltrated the building and rescued the imprisoned Captain Donovan. After Donovan revealed that his ship was hijacked, Cora tasked spacers to assault a Deflarian camp, whose location was provided by Donovan. During the raid, the spacers killed several Deflarian guards and mechanics, as well as Deflaros and his bodyguards, and secured Donovan's ship and its cargo.\nDeflaros was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Deflaros was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
