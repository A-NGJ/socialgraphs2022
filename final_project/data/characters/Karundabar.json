 "content": "Karundabar was a male Wookiee imprisoned on the mining tunnels of Oovo IV for his crimes. Having been in the mines for such a long time, Karundabar lost much of his hair, as well most of his eyesight due to the cataracts that filmed his eyes. After spending decades in the mines, the work began to leave its mark on him as his coat fell out and he went blind. Later in his term, Karundabar slowly forgot why he had even come to Oovo IV and let the days pass. He was now able to perform his work so routinely that even the loss of his eyesight no longer hindered him. During his time on Oovo IV, Karundabar also met the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, who had been sent to prison by Aayla Secura.",
