 "content": "Bolf was a Human member of the Five Worlds.\nIn 40 ABY, Bolf operated with other insurgents on Coruscant during the Second Galactic Civil War. They, along with other Corellians, were working with the bounty hunter Ailyn Habuur. They were arrested after Ben Skywalker had a hunch about explosives in the area where they were located.\nBolf was created by Karen Traviss for the 2006 Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines. In the novel, three insurgents, including Bolf, are allied with Ailyn Vel, and, excluding Vel, are listed as two males and one female. Thus, Bolf's exact gender is never revealed.",
