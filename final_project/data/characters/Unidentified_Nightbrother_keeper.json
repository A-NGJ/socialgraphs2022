 "content": "A Nightbrother was the keeper of Maul during his childhood on Dathomir. After the Sith Lord Darth Sidious persuaded Maul's mother, Mother Talzin, to give him away to a keeper, Maul was angered and fled into the surrounding woods. When Maul's keeper found him the next day, he struck him across the face as punishment. The keeper eventually introduced him to his two sons who would become his adoptive kin. After he brought his two sons to the Selection, leaving Maul at home, Maul broke out. When Maul arrived to the event, he choked his keeper using the Force.",
