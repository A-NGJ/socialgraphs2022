 "content": "Whie Malreaux was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Padawan who lived during the final years of the Galactic Republic. He was killed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who led the Siege of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in the waning days of the Clone Wars.\nWhie Malreaux was a member of the Jedi Order prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire. He lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic, an era defined by a growing secessionist movement that culminated in the galaxy-wide civil war known as the Clone Wars. By the third year of the conflict, Darth Sidious—the Dark Lord of the Sith publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—tasked his new apprentice, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, with leading the 501st Legion in the Siege of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant as part of the implementation of Order 66. During the invasion, Malreaux fought beside his Jedi brothers and sisters in defense of the Temple, but was ultimately killed alongside Bene and Jedi Master Cin Drallig in a duel with Vader. After the fall of the Temple, Obi-Wan Kenobi witnessed the actions of his fallen apprentice, including Malreaux's death, through a holographic recording of the battle.\nWhie Malreaux was a human male who possessed a fair complexion, blond hair, and blue eyes. He also wore a Padawan braid, marking his status within the Jedi Order. During the fall of the Jedi Temple, he stood with his fellow Jedi against Darth Vader, an act which cost Malreaux his life.\nAs a Padawan learner, Whie Malreaux was trained in the Jedi arts in order to hone his natural talents with the Force. At the time of Order 66, he wielded a green-colored lightsaber.\nWhie Malreaux was portrayed by Coinneach Alexander in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Peter Alexander, Coinneach's father, the sensei  of Byron Bay Kendo Club, appeared with his students as Jedi in the First Battle of Geonosis arena scene in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Though Malreaux first appeared in Sean Stewart's 2004 Star Wars Legends novel Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, the character was originally created for Revenge of the Sith.",
