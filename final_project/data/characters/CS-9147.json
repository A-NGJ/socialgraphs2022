 "content": "CS-9147 was a human from the Otomok system who served the First Order as a jet trooper. In 35 ABY, CS-9147 and another jet trooper pursued the scavenger Rey and her Resistance allies through the deserts of the planet Pasaana. The two destroyed their foes' skimmers but were ultimately killed by its crew.\nCS-9147 was a human born in the Otomok system in 10 ABY who served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the First Order as a jet trooper. In 35 ABY, CS-9147 and another jet trooper were amongst a division of First Order forces deployed to the planet Pasaana to search for the scavenger Rey and her allies in the Resistance. One of the two jet troopers spotted their targets fleeing on skimmers from the Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley and alerted the other First Order forces.\nCS-9147 and the other jet trooper gave chase on the back of two stormtroopers' respective 125-Z treadspeeder bikes, launching from the vehicles and opening fire on the skimmers. Their targets split up, with Resistance members Finn, Poe Dameron and C-3PO heading down a narrow valley in their HS-19 cargo loading transport skimmer. One treadbike followed them down the valley, but the two jet troopers and remaining treadspeeder continued chasing Rey and her allies Chewbacca and BB-8 as they remained in the open desert on an Arunskin 75D skimmer.\nAfter the treadspeeder was destroyed, Chewbacca managed to shoot down one of the two jet troopers with his bowcaster. After the two skimmers reunited, the second jet trooper managed to destroy both vehicles, but was killed when the skimmers' occupants survived and returned fire.\nCS-9147 stood 1.8 meters tall.\nCS-9147 wore white jet trooper armor, including a NJP-900 integrated jetpack and a helmet. The trooper carried a G125 projectile launcher.\nCS-9147 was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. Only two jet troopers appear in the film, but the Visual Dictionary does not provide enough information to distinguish which of the two is CS-9147.",
