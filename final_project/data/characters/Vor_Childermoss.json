 "content": "Vor Childermoss was a Human leader of the Torgaigne crime syndicate, based off of the planet Attahox during the era of the Galactic Civil War. Noted for being an especially hard, fearless and unforgiving taskmaster, Childermoss oversaw the Torgaigne's trade in phosovane salts, used on many Outer Rim worlds as a base for painkillers. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Childermoss and his crew—which included his personal muscle, the hulking mute Leelu—pursued Rebel leader Han Solo into the nearby Hellhoop after Solo was caught smuggling phosovane salts on Attahox. There, Childermoss and his men were captured by the Five, a reclusive evil-worshipping cult that lived within that region of space. After Childermoss made the mistake of threatening the cultists, Five member Mavin utterly destroyed Childermoss and the rest of the Torgaigne with a black fireclaw.\nVor Childermoss appeared in The Pandora Effect, a 1981 comic story written by Alan Moore and published in The Empire Strikes Back Monthly 151. In the story, Childermoss was drawn by Adolfo Buylla.",
