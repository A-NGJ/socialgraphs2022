 "content": "Nilim Bril was a male Rutian Twi'lek who lived on Ryloth in the city of Nabat with his niece Numa.\nAfter Techno Union Foreman and Separatist member Wat Tambor invaded Ryloth, Nilim Bril, along with the rest of the Twi'leks of Nabat, was captured by Tactical droid commander TX-20 and used as a \"living shield\" against the Republic army, as the tactical droid believed that the Republic would not put innocent lives at risk.\nAfter learning of the Twi'leks' capture, General Obi-Wan Kenobi met his niece Numa, and she led him through the underground passages to the hostages. Along with Waxer and Boil, Obi-Wan was able to free Nilim and the rest of the Twi'leks, and Nilim was reunited with Numa. After Obi-Wan, Waxer and Boil were blasted aside by TX-20's tank, Numa ran to help them, and inspired by her courage, Nilim led the Twi'leks in an attack on the tactical droid, and they were able to destroy him. After General Mace Windu and the other Acclamator-class landing ships landed, Nilim, Numa and the other villagers then watched as both Kenobi's and Windu's forces left Nabat to liberate the rest of the planet.",
