 "content": "Tarlor Choh was a tall, light-skinned, male Muun who worked for the company Dalborg Mining five years before the Battle of Yavin. Choh served as the companies foreman in Zone Thirty-Nine, an area of the moon Cynda where Thorilide was mined. He at one point demoted the demolitions expert Skelly from demolitions supervisor to demolitions placement tech. This greatly annoyed Skelly, who considered Choh an imbecile. When the Galactic Empire sent Count Denetrius Vidian to increase the efficiency of mining on Cynda, it was Choh that delivered the message to Dalborg's employees, who he then began trying to motivate to work faster. When a group of four stormtroopers arrived to arrest Skelly, Choh was happy to comply and led them to the demolitions expert, firing him on the spot. Skelly then managed to set off an explosion which allowed him to escape Choh and the Imperials.\nTarlor Choh first appeared in A New Dawn, a novel written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2014. Choh's species is never revealed in the book, as Miller wanted to show how cosmopolitan the Star Wars galaxy was by not having the point of view characters even think about the species of others. He later revealed Choh was a Muun in the production notes for A New Dawn, which he released on his blog.",
