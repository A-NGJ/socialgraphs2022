 "content": "Oric Traless was a male Nautolan Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order as a member of the Jedi High Council during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. He served as the Council's chief combat advisor.\nA Force-sensitive male Nautolan, Oric Traless was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order three centuries after the end of the Jedi Civil War. Following the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic in the wake of the Great Galactic War, the Jedi Order retreated from Coruscant and took up residence on their ancestral homeworld, Tython. As a prolonged Cold War took its toll on the galaxy, Traless was made a Jedi Master and earned a seat on the Jedi High Council. Traless wielded a green lightsaber in combat. When the Sith Empire attacked Tython in 3637 BBY, Master Traless defended the Jedi Temple, though he fell in combat against the Sith invaders.\nOric Traless was first introduced in the 2010 novel The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance, a tie-in to the then-upcoming video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Fatal Alliance was largely ignored by The Old Republic's metaseries, as it was written early in the development process of The Old Republic. However, Traless appeared in the Tactical Flashpoint: Assault on Tython that was released with Game Update 2.7: Invasion in April 2014, making him the first Fatal Alliance character aside from Satele Shan to reappear in continuity.",
