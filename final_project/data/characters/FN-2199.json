 "content": "FN-2199, nicknamed \"Nines,\" was a human male stormtrooper who served the First Order in the decades following the Galactic Civil War. He served alongside his friend and brother-in-arms, FN-2187. Following FN-2187's desertion, Nines confronted and fought with his former comrade at the Battle of Takodana. Accusing the former trooper of treason, Nines initially gained the upper hand but was fatally shot by Han Solo before he could kill FN-2187.\nFN-2199 was a stormtrooper who served the First Order in the decades after the Galactic Civil War. Training in the FN Corps alongside FN-2000 \"Zeroes,\" FN-2003 \"Slip,\" and FN-2187 \"Eight-Seven,\" he took the nickname \"Nines\" because he liked the sound of it. They trained under Captain Phasma, practicing in simulated combat for most of their lives. During their first deployment, the FN Corps was brought to the mining facility in Pressy's Tumble, an asteroid field, and ordered to kill the workers that had gone on strike. Initially reluctant, Nines followed as ordered once Slip and Zeroes opened fire.\nDuring the conflict between the First Order and the Republic-backed Resistance, Kylo Ren of the Knights of Ren sought part of a map that led to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who had vanished years earlier. The map was held by BB-8, an astromech droid that the First Order tracked to the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana. Nines was one of the soldiers in the division that followed Ren to Takodana where he attempted to acquire the droid in the early stages of the new galactic conflict. By then, FN-2187 defected from the First Order after witnessing the massacre of Tuanul on Jakku.\nNines encountered his old comrade, who now went by the name of \"Finn,\" during the raid on Takodana. Utilizing a Z6 riot control baton against a Jedi lightsaber wielded by Finn, Nines attempted to subdue the former stormtrooper through single combat. Although he gained the upper hand in their duel, knocking Finn to the ground with a direct hit to the torso, Nines was ultimately gunned down by Han Solo, who shot the unsuspecting trooper with Chewbacca's bowcaster.\nNines was a human male who had red hair, blue eyes and light skin. Trained since birth, he was a loyal soldier in the armed forces of the First Order, to the point of executing civilians in spite of his own reluctance to carry out such an order. Finn's desertion of the Stormtrooper Corps angered Nines, who denounced his former friend as a traitor. He discarded his F-11D blaster rifle and riot shield, choosing to attack Finn with only a single melee weapon.\nFN-2199 was a skilled member of the FN Corps, beating the highly trained FN-2187, or \"Finn\", in melee combat using only a riot baton. He was able to knock the defected stormtrooper down, but was gunned down by Han Solo using Chewbacca's bowcaster.\nFN-2199 was first introduced in the 2015 novel Before the Awakening, written by Greg Rucka. He appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.\nFN-2199 was physically portrayed by veteran stuntman Liang Yang, while his voice was provided by David Acord, a sound editor for Skywalker Sound.\nHis scene in the film, where he shouts \"Traitor!\" at Finn, led to him quickly becoming an internet sensation shortly after its release. Before his official name was given, fans had labeled the character as \"TR-8R\". Because of his popularity among fans, FN-2199 became the star of many Internet memes.\nIn the free-roam mode of LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, FN-2000 appears on Takodana and is seen mourning FN-2199's passing during the battle. FN-2000 provides the player with a side mission, in which he asks the player to retrieve FN-2199's stun baton, which has been stolen by mercenaries residing on Takodana. Completing that mission awards the player with a gold brick.",
