 "content": "A human monitor who served the Resistance as a tactical officer was aboard the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus during the evacuation of D'Qar. After the Resistance successfully evacuated the planet, the Raddus jumped to lightspeed, but was tracked through hyperspace by Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy. The moniotor saw the First Order forces on their screens as the enemy fleet exited hyperspace and immediately notified Commander Poe Dameron that the First Order had found them. The command bridge of the Raddus was destroyed shortly thereafter.\nThe character was portrayed by Michaela Coel in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Coel only did one line for her scene and was convinced that her part would be cut from the film, but it ultimately was not.\nIn the original cut of the movie, the Resistance monitor reports to Poe Dameron when the First Order's forces arrive during an alternate depiction of the evacuation of D'Qar, a scene which was present in both the adult and junior novelizations of the film. During post-production, the report was edited into the scene where the First Order finds the Resistance after the latter exits hyperspace, although it is still Poe who responds to her report.",
