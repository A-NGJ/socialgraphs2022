 "content": "Zylixx was a male Human Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order who fought against the Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nDuring the Cold War, onboard a Defender-class light corvette over the planet Nal Hutta, Jedi Master Nomen Karr's Padawan Jaesa Willsaam rashly contacted the future Emperor's Wrath, an apprentice to Darth Baras after the Sith killed Master Yonlach and her parents. However, Karr discovered her plan and talked her out of it, sending Jedi Knights Ulldin and Zylixx in her place to wait for the Sith and end the threat.\nWhen the Sith boarded the ship, Ulldin and Zylixx stood ready. Ulldin warned the Warrior that he could not prevail against two Jedi Knights and demanded that the Sith surrender. Zylixx, however, expected the Warrior to engage them in battle, as all the Sith they had faced did. Rather than draw his lightsaber, the Warrior chose to goad Zylixx into giving into his anger and lash out, forcing Ulldin's hand. The two Knights engaged the Sith in a duel, but were easily defeated. Zylixx was the first to be slain by the deadly apprentice before he was this close in giving in to the dark side, leaving his companion Ulldin badly injured and at the Sith's mercy.\nDepending on the player's choices, Zylixx's fate can be decided many different ways:",
