He broke out of the Belsavis prison during a break around 3641 BBY, but was killed sometime after breaking out.\nOgun appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Belsavis. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by characters of both factions or loot and as part of the achievement.
