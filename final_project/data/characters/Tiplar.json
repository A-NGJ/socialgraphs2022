 "content": "Tiplar was a yellow-skinned Mikkian female Jedi Master who served as a Jedi General within the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. As part of her military service, Tiplar and her twin sister Tiplee led a unit of clone troopers along with Clone Commander Doom. Such was the case during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, in which the three of them collaborated with Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's 501st Legion to oust the Confederacy of Independent Systems from a space station orbiting Ringo Vinda. At the height of the campaign, 501st clone trooper Tup executed Tiplar by shooting her in the head due to a malfunction in his inhibitor chip, which triggered a premature activation of Clone Protocol 66, a Sith-implanted directive that branded all Jedi as traitors. Tiplar's death cost the Republic forces a potential victory and instead forced them to retreat, while Tup's apparent act of treason sparked a high-profile investigation that led ARC trooper Fives to uncover the existence and function of the clones' inhibitor chips.\nTiplar, a Mikkian female, lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. She and her twin sister, Tiplee, were both Force-sensitive and were inducted into the Jedi Order, with both of them eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Tiplar and her sister accepted commissions as Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic, and they sometimes served together in military campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They frequently fought alongside clone troopers under the command of Clone Commander Doom.\nOver two years into the war, Tiplar joined forces with Tiplee, Doom, and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker to repel a Confederate battle group from an orbital space station that encircled the planet Ringo Vinda. The ensuing campaign lasted several rotations, leading to a stalemate between the Republic and Confederate forces. Determined to break the deadlock, Tiplar and her comrades launched an offensive against the battle droid infantry led by Confederate Admiral Trench, advancing through the space station's corridors in an attempt to reach a communications center. Upon encountering a squad of BX-series droid commandos, Tiplar ordered Doom and his clone soldiers to shore up their left flank against the incoming droids. The appearance of a trio of droidekas led Tiplar to have her men prop up their energy shields, which they used to repel the droideka's heavy barrages of blasterfire. Reaching out with the Force, Tiplar telekinetically pushed the droidekas off their footing long enough for Doom and his soldiers to roll Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades underneath the droids' shields, thus disabling their adversaries. They proceeded to the communications center, where they eliminated the droids manning the station.\nOnce they had secured their position, Tiplar and Tiplee met with Skywalker and his troops from the 501st Legion to coordinate their assault on Trench's command center. Trench had requested reinforcements, so it was imperative that they capture the enemy facility as soon as possible. Since there were three hallways that led to the command center, Skywalker suggested that each Jedi General take one of the corridors; their teams would converge on Trench's position at the same time, thereby overwhelming his defenses. Skywalker had ARC trooper CT-5555 and 501st trooper CT-5385—nicknamed \"Fives\" and \"Tup,\" respectively—bring along ten of their best soldiers to supplement Tiplar and Doom's men, who had been severely depleted in the earlier assault.\nWith their plan in place, Tiplar and Doom proceeded to the left passageway with Fives, Tup, and their troops and marched through the corridor, demolishing all of the droid forces that they encountered. Tiplar and her troopers soon reached the spacious chamber in front of Trench's command center, where they used some stacks of crates as cover from Trench's B1-series battle droids, DSD1 dwarf spider droids, and B2 super rocket troopers. However, just as the Republic forces were on the verge of conquering Trench's infantry, a malfunction in Tup's inhibitor chip caused him to prematurely execute Clone Protocol 66, a Sith-engineered command to execute all Jedi as traitors. As Tiplar was deflecting incoming enemy blasterfire with her lightsaber, Tup strode over to her, and when she turned towards him in surprise, he shot her in the face with his DC-15A blaster carbine, instantly killing her.\nTiplar's death impeded the Republic's advance, turning an imminent victory into a retreat. Tiplee was shocked to witness Tiplar's execution and mourned her late sister. Tiplar's comrades brought her body back to the communications center, where Skywalker and 501st Clone Captain Rex interrogated Tup regarding his apparent act of treason. However, Tup merely repeated the phrase \"Good soldiers follow orders\" before unsuccessfully attacking Tiplee. Meanwhile, news of Tiplar's death reached Separatist leader Count Dooku, who ordered Trench to retrieve Tup for analysis. Trench's efforts failed, and Fives and Rex escorted Tup back to the clone homeworld of Kamino, where Jedi Master Shaak Ti and Kaminoan Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se subjected Tup to medical examination to uncover the source of his breakdown.\nUltimately, Fives learned of the Sith's conspiracy against the Jedi and the machinations leading to Tiplar's murder, but he was killed before he could prove his findings to the Jedi. The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, in his guise as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, provided the Republic's official explanation that a Ringo Vindan parasite had led Tup's inhibitor chip – supposedly there to keep the clones mentally stable – to deteriorate, thus causing his execution of Tiplar. The same excuse was used to discredit Fives and \"explain\" the actions he had taken while attempting to reveal the truth.\nToward the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda traveled to a planet that was the birthplace of the midi-chlorians. There, five Force Priestesses subjected him to a series of trials to determine whether he was worthy of learning the knowledge they possessed. In the Valley of Extinction, Yoda saw a vision of the Jedi Temple training ground, where Tiplar and a number of other Jedi, alive and dead, appeared as they had before the war. Though tempted to join his colleagues, Yoda recognized the impossibility of the illusion and overcame it, bringing the vision to an end.\nAfter the issuing of Order 66, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano and her astromech droid R7-A7 found files about Tiplar and her death at Tup's hands while reading secure files on Fives to ascertain what was wrong with the clones onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, following up on a clue Rex had managed to give her before his control chip took him over. The files included images of Tiplar and Tup, a brain scan showing the location of the chip, a report from Nala Se listing the official explanation for Tup's actions, and a grievance report Rex had filed after Fives' death reporting his suspicions that the chips might have an ulterior purpose. Tano, R7, and two other droids were then able to capture Rex and remove his chip, restoring his free will. The two of them subsequently escaped the Star Destroyer before it crashed, killing everyone still onboard.\nA Mikkian female, Tiplar had yellow-green skin and blue eyes. Her forehead was adorned with a tattoo that was identical to that of her twin sister, Tiplee. Tiplar formed a good working relationship with Commander Doom and the soldiers under her command, and they worked together to efficiently eliminate threats on the battlefield, summarily disabling BX-series droid commandos as well as droidekas during the Battle of Ringo Vinda.\nTiplar possessed a mastery of the Force and consequently achieved the rank of Jedi Master. She was adept with telekinesis, evinced during the Battle of Ringo Vinda when she pushed a trio of enemy droidekas off their footing long enough for her clone troopers to dispatch them. She was also agile, and she used that in conjunction with skill with a lightsaber to deflect incoming blaster bolts and execute acrobatic flips on the battlefield.\nTiplar wielded a green-bladed lightsaber in combat. Her apparel consisted of a full-body outfit, boots, and a headpiece.\nThe character of Tiplar was created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and debuted in the episode \"The Unknown.\" The episode was released as part of The Lost Missions, the series' sixth season, on March 7, 2014. On March 11, 2013, almost a year prior to the episode's release, Tiplar was featured in a promotional clip for the series. Both Tiplar and her sister, Tiplee, were portrayed by voice actor Anna Graves, who also voiced other recurring characters throughout the series like Duchess Satine Kryze and the bounty hunter Sugi. Although \"The Unknown\" depicts Tiplar as being killed by being shot in the face, as she turns in surprise when Tup walks up to her, her face has no markings on it when Tiplee picks up her body.\nTiplar's and Tiplee's character models were based on artist Iain McCaig's concept design of a female Sith Lord, which was developed for the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones but was ultimately not used in the film.\nStar Wars Jedi Pocket Expert mistakenly states that Tiplar was a Jedi Knight",
