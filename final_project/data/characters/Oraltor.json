 "content": "Oraltor was a male Ithorian who served as an assistant to Senator Tendau Bendon during waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nIn 32 BBY, Oraltor and Bendon were present in the Senate Building as Queen Padm√© Amidala of Naboo presented a motion of censure against Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum following the invasion on the Queen's planet by the Trade Federation.\nAfter Palpatine became the Supreme Chancellor, Oraltor continued his career with Senator Bendon during the years which followed the Separatist Crisis. Before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Oraltor was present with Bendon who supported in the Senate during the Military Creation Act.\nIn 19 BBY, the final year of the war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Oraltor, along with a number of delegates, grew suspicious over Palpatine's growing powers and feared for the future of democracy in the Republic. Following the Declaration of a New Order, Oraltor, along with Senator Bendon and a number of delegates from the Delegation of 2000, were arrested by the newly-formed government after Palpatine announced himself as the First Emperor of the Galactic Empire. He was later executed by the Imperial Intelligence.",
