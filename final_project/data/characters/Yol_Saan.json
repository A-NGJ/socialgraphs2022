 "content": "Yol Saan was a male Toydarian gambler who lived on the planet Tatooine around 44 ABY. Saan frequented Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the city Mos Eisley. He was very talented at cheating while gambling but allowed himself to lose just often enough that his cheating was not discovered.\nYol Saan appeared in Fate of the Jedi: Allies, the fifth novel in the Fate of the Jedi series. Allies was written by Christie Golden and published in 2010.",
