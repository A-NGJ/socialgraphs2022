 "content": "Armo Malou was a male alien who worked as head barkeeper at the Canto Casino in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. In the year 34 ABY, he was present in the casino when the Resistance operatives Finn and Rose Tico entered. Malou's job as barkeeper required great skill, as the casino's patrons included many different species from all across the galaxy, all with different tastes. A consummate professional, Malou invented many famous cocktails, including the Stinky Wampa, the Clouds of Bespin and the Xagobah Sour. He wore a green waistcoat with yellow patterning in casino livery over a white shirt with a red belt, as well as black pants with red and yellow patterning. Malou had gray skin, brown hair and black eyes.\nArmo Malou first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. The character was not named in the film, but received identification on a card in the Star Wars: Card Trader application, as part of the \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Base Set Wave 2\" set.",
