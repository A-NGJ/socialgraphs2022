 "content": "Avrak Villachor was a Human male Black Sun Sector Chief who lived on the planet Wukkar. He was known for holding the Festival of Four Honorings at his home, the Marblewood Estate in Iltarr City. As a sector chief, he was charged with keeping Prince Xizor's personal blackmail files safe within his vault. They were later stolen by Han Solo's team followed by the death of the Black Sun vigo Qazadi in his home. Following this, Villachor knew Black Sun would seek vengeance and sought protection from the Galactic Empire.",
