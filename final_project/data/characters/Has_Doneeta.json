 "content": "Has Doneeta was a male Twi'lek and the owner of Ryloth Ventures. His daughter was Tuulaa Doneeta. He had holdings throughout the galaxy, and his daughter was raised in a variety of places. In 22 BBY, he was interested in opening trade on Devaron.\nHas Doneeta and Ryloth Ventures were part of a backstory given by the undercover Jedi Aayla Secura, An'ya Kuro, and Tholme. The amount of truth to either is not known, although as it was accepted, presumably they both existed.",
