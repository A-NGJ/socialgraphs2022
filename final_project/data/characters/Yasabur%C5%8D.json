 "content": "Yasaburō was a Force-sensitive human male who lived on Tao during the Imperial Era, and the leader of a powerful organization. His daughter was Ochō. Ochō befriended a runaway Lepi slave named Lop and convinced Yasaburō to take her into their family.\nYasaburō promoted a rebellion on Tao against the Galactic Empire's oppression of his homeworld. His daughter, however, joined the Empire.\nYasaburō had a strong sense of honor, as shown by the fact that he felt compelled to adopt Lop into his family after Ochō played with the Lepi girl on the beach.\nAt some point in his life prior to adopting Lop, Yasaburō was injured and lost the use of his left eye. Later, he would be blinded in his right eye by his daughter Ochō.\nYasaburō used the Force when performing a family ritual in which he granted Lop the Yasaburō family heirloom lightsaber as inheritance.\nYasaburō was named in the Japanese original as 弥三郎 . He appeared in \"Lop \u0026 Ochō,\" a short film in the Star Wars: Visions series written by Sayawaka and directed by Yuki Igarashi. The short, produced by Geno Studio, released on Disney+ on September 22, 2021.",
