 "content": "During the early stages of the Galactic Civil War , a Gungan in a Bongo vehicle escorted a Star Tours-owned StarSpeeder 1000 to a Rebel hangar on Naboo via the planet core, after the vessel had dived into the water to avoid Vulture droids from the ensuing battle above, and after its original escort, three N-1 starfighters, were shot down. It was eventually ambushed by an Opee sea killer, although it managed to escape from its jaws via a Sando aqua monster.\nSince the Star Tours attraction visits one of three different planets during each segment of the ride, this starfighter pilot does not always appear.",
