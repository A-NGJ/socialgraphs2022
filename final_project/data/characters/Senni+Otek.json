 "content": "Senni Otek was the chief technician of the Jedi Dreamer.\nOtek was born on Lianna to parents who were engineers at Sienar Fleet Systems. While she inherited their technological aptitude and curiosity, she didn't like the Empire as they did. She managed to make it through school without professing loyalty to the Empire, and attempted to make contact with the Rebel Alliance. The Empire found out and arrested her parents in an attempt to force her to comply with the New Order. The Rebels put together a strike team and rescued her, but her parents were killed in the battle.\nOtek joined the Rebel Alliance and was assigned to a Mon Calamari cruiser as a technician. She participated in the Battle of Endor. After the conflict, she assisted Korren Starchaser in designing the Jedi Dreamer and joined his crew.",
