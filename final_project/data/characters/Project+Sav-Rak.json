 "content": "Project Sav-Rak was the designation given to a Mantellian Savrip that Doctor Sannus Lorrick exposed to the rakghoul plague during the Galactic War. After the rakghoul outbreak in the Tion Hegemony was traced to Lorrick's laboratory on Ord Mantell, Lorrick released Project Sav-Rak in an effort to slow the intruders that raided his base, though the creature was killed.\nProject Sav-Rak appears as a boss in the Lost Island Flashpoint, which was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 1.2.",
