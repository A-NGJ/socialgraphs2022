 "content": "Sirai was a Pantoran who served as an ensign under Commodore Kyrsta Agate on the starship Concord. Sirai attended the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY. Sirai was responsible of the weapons. When their starship was damaged by the Star Destroyer Punishment, Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar ordered Agate and her crew to abandon ship. While the crew evacuated the ship, Agate decided to launch a frontal attack on the Ravager with all her ship's firepower and arsenal.",
