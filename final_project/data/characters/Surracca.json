 "content": "Surracca was a male Wookiee, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nSurracca was mated to Delinna and lived in the village Kiirloor on the planet of Cularin. When Kiirloor began to suffer a series of problems that culminated in the disappearance of a child, Surracca traveled with Delinna to Mother Dariana's naming day ceremony, to ask her for help. The two Wookiees then traveled back to the village with the Heroes of Cularin. However, while they traveled, there was a groundquake and they arrived at the village to find it very damaged.",
