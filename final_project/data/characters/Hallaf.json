 "content": "Hallaf was a Human male smuggler who owned Meliflar Station. After Abeloth's visit to the station and her infection of his daughter, Fala, his crew, led by Cardya, mutinied against him. He was put into the brig along with his daughter. There, the Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, his son, Ben, and Sith apprentice Vestara Khai, found them. He pleaded with the Jedi to help his daughter and gave them the access codes to his station. After Master Skywalker had healed Fala, he was grateful for his help and for not reporting them to the authorities.",
