 "content": "Illist Mandrep was a deranged Arcona who was strongly addicted to salt, which resulted in severe delusions of being persecuted. He became a bounty hunter, sliding through the Imperial bureaucracy despite his mental state, and becoming something of a walking arsenal. A paranoid maniac, Illist was known for taking out large numbers of civilians in an effort to acquire his target.",
