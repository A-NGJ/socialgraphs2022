 "content": "Quorlac Fornayh was a male Near-Human Sith Lord who lived over a thousand years before the Galactic Civil War. After the course of a war with the Galactic Republic turned against the Sith, Fornayh took shelter at his hidden fortress on the planet Yorgraxx. Over the next century, he channelled his efforts into the development of the coloi, a deadly, winged mutant rancor. By the time his creation was finalized, Fornayh was close to death and he stowed his single coloi specimen in stasis before passing away.\nThe Sith Lord endured afer death in the Force as a dark side spirit and he was awakened when an Imperial freighter and Rebel Alliance vessel were wrecked on Yorgraxx during the Galactic Civil War. Fornayh and his coloi subsequently attacked the crash survivors after they ventured into his fortress and were defeated by the group.\nQuorlac Fornayh was a Force-sensitive Near-Human male Sith Lord, who served one of the Sith Empires over a 1000 years before the Galactic Civil War, amid a time of war between the Sith and the rival Galactic Republic. Fornayh established a base of operations on the planet Yorgraxx, located in the Prefsbelt sector of the Outer Rim Territories and enslaved the world's native native population. He employed his workforce to build a concealed underground fortress for his personal use, sited far beneath a high mountain range and exterminated the natives once construction of the base was completed. The Sith Lord programmed two sentry droids to protect the entrance to his facility on the planetary surface and also kept two lightsaber weapons with the base, one in his personal quarters and one within the installation's central control room.\nAfter the tide of the war with the Republic turned against the Sith, Fornayh and many other Sith Lords were forced into hiding. The Near-Human retreated to his stronghold on Yorgraxx to strengthen his forces and began work on the development of the coloi mutant rancor reptomammalthat Fornayh schemed to use to seize the throne of the Sith Empire.\nOver the next 100 years, Fornayh refined his mutant creation, utilizing a stock of rancor clones as he perfected a template coloi. At great effort, Fornayh altered the rancor genetic structure, increasing the creature's intelligence. To allow the mutant to fly he lightened its skeletal structure and added wings, and to grant it protection, he added black metallic plating in place of skin.\nBy the time Fornayh had finalized his coloi template, he was close to death. Lacking sufficient time to instruct the mutant in the use of vibroweapons and blaster weapons or to clone additional rancors to turn into colois, Fornayh placed his single prototype coloi into suspended animation within a stasis unit in preparation for his imminent passing. Confident that his essence would live on through the Force, the Sith Lord planned to return to life through a clone body after his physical death. He programmed the sensors of his Yorgraxx base to activate four labor droids in the event of a starship landing on the planet, which were then to bring the base back online.\nFollowing his demise, Fornayh's consciousness endured as a dark side spirit, waiting on Yorgraxx for someone to rediscover his base. Over one thousand years later, at some stage after the Battle of Yavin, the YT-2400 light freighter Predator's Beak, a scout vessel of the Galactic Empire, crashed onto Fornayh's planet, triggering automatic reactivation of the Sith Lord's fortress. Fornayh's spirit was awoken, resulting in a disturbance in the Force, and he observed as his labor droids powered up the base's systems. Far across the galaxy on the planet Coruscant, the Imperial leader Emperor Palpatine sensed the Near-Human Sith Lord's revival and dispatched the Emperor's Hand Jallar Golin hand to investigate.\nOne month later, the Rebel Alliance transport Griffon's Wings crashed on Yorgraxx and the crew joined forces with two survivors from the stricken Imperial freighter, Arran Flekk and Vor Harkass. The group were drawn to Fornayh's facility by his dark aura and a Sith probe droid alerted him to their approach. The crash survivors penetrated the fortress and Fornayh watched on unseen from the ceiling as they reached a large cavern at the highest point of the Sith Lord's base.\nDetermined to stop the Imperials and Rebels from investigating his base, Fornayh roused his specimen coloi. To divert the group's attention, Fornayh conjured several illusory sentry droids to attack the interlopers, then directed his specimen coloi to ambush the party. In the resulting struggle, the Sith spirit discontinued the sentry droids illusion and combated the crash survivors directly, but was defeated. Following the fight, the Imperials and Rebels continued their investigation of the Sith fortress. Fornayh monitored the group and attempted mind tricks against them to deceive them regarding the contents of his facility, though he refrained from attacking them again.\nFornayh was ambitious and coveted the throne of the Sith, believing that his mastery of the coloi would allow him to secure control of the Sith Empire. He was patient and went into hiding after he judged that fortune had turned against the Sith in the war against the Republic, carefully strengthening his power base on Yorgraxx. Fornayh bided his time, waiting for an opportunity to bring his plans to gain power to fruition, even after his physical death. A ruthless individual, he wiped out the native Yorgraxx population and developed the coloi, a deadly creature that was more dangerous even than Fornayh had planned.\nIn his afterlife as a dark side spirit, Fornayh manifested as a shadowy dark figure. He was pleased when the Imperial freighter Predator's Beak crashed on Yorgraxx and triggered the reactivation of his fortress though he was not keen for the crash survivors to learn about his operations.\nA skilled alchemist, Fornayh was adept in the arts of Sith sorcery and capable manipulating the genetic structure of his test subjects. He was also familiar with the construction of lightsaber weapons. As a Sith Lord, Fornayh was proficient in the use of the Force to sense things, influence the minds of others, move objects and to heal himself. He also was familiar with the Force powers Battlemind and Enhance Ability. He was bilingual and, in addition to Basic, he was fluent in Sith.\nFollowing his physical death, in his spirit form Fornayh could hover above the ground and move through solid objects. Though invulnerable to physical attacks, his spirit lost the ability to accomplish Force powers that had physical effects. He had the capacity to possess sentient individuals and if he took control of a person's body, then through them he regained access to the full set of Force powers that he had wielded in life. He could conjure complex illusions and when confronting the Imperial and Rebel crash survivors in his Yorgraxx fortress, he projected several phantom sentry droids. To maximise the realism of his illusion he added the appearance of battle damage to the droids when they came under fire. The effort of maintaining such intricate illusions required all of his focus and he was unable to simultaneously utilize any other Force powers.\nQuorlac Fornayh featured in Star Wars Legends RPGA roleplaying module Shadows in the Force, written by Robert Wiese and published in 2004. In the adventure, the players roleplay as the crash survivors that Fornayh's spirit encounter and various outcomes are possible. If the player characters immediately destroy a Sith probe droid that finds them, Fornayh is not alerted of their approach to his base, he is otherwise alerted by the droid of their coming. During his fight with the Imperials and Rebels, if his coloi comes close to defeat, Fornayh can attempt to possess one of the player characters. If successful, through his new avatar he immediately summons a lightsaber to wield against his adversaries.\nShadows in the Force describes Fornayh as a Near-Human, a generic term for races similar to baseline Humans, and does not specify his species. The module also describes him as having served the Sith Empire; Star Wars Legends media depicts various iterations of the Sith Empire, including the Sith Empire of the Great Hyperspace War, the Sith Empire of Darth Revan and the New Sith Empire, and it is unclear which specific Sith Empire Fornayh was affiliated with.",
