 "content": "Rolend Zavros was a Togruta male Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the Great Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. Rolend was married to a fellow Togruta Jedi Knight named Yanila, and around 3662 BBY, the two had a daughter they named Ashara, though their duties in the ongoing war often prevented the two from spending much time with their daughter as she grew up on the Republic capital of Coruscant.\nIn 3653 BBY, just as Ashara began showing signs of the strength in the Force common to the Zavros family, Rolend and Yanila were present on Coruscant when the Sith Empire sacked the planet. Both Jedi were killed defending the Jedi Temple from Sith invaders, leaving Ashara to be adopted by the Jedi Masters Ryen and Ocera. Ashara later told her Sith Master Lord Kallig that she had very few memories of her parents as a result.\nRolend Zavros was first mentioned in conversations with the Sith Inquisitor companion Ashara Zavros in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, though he was not named until the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, which was published by Dorling Kindersley. In The Old Republic, the conversation \"Masters\" establishes that Zavros's parents died in the Sacking of Coruscant, which is backed up by The Old Republic Encyclopedia. However, in the conversation \"Fear and Longing,\" which occurs if the player-character is not romancing Zavros, she reads a letter from her parents and says that they are still alive, though she has not seen them in fifteen years. This article assumes that the latter conversation is in error.",
