 "content": "Zuka was a Mandalorian warrior who was aided by Meetra Surik in fixing a telemetry computer in the Mandalorian base on Dxun.\nZuka was the tech specialist for the re-established Mandalorian camp on Dxun. Though he preferred fixing things over combat, he was nonetheless valued by Mandalore the Preserver for his technical skills.\nDuring Meetra Surik's visit to the camp, Zuka was the first to discover the infiltrating Sith assassins, setting a trap for one of them and causing the Sith to be caught in an explosion as he decloaked to attack Zuka. He then warned his fellow Mandalorians of the concealed Sith.\nZuka also located the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd on Dxun for Surik just before participating in the Second Battle of Onderon. He was also among the Mandalorians who fought in the Battle of Telos IV, where he supervised the placing of proton cores throughout the Ravager. When one of the proton charges went off prematurely in a Sith counterattack on his position, Zuka was wounded; when he reported the situation to Mandalore he offered up his life in repayment for the botched job, but was rebuffed.",
