 "content": "Spike was a Zeldrate owned by Yarvok, the leader of the Nova Blades pirates group. Yarvok was fond of Spike, calling the pet his \"beloved.\" Yarvok felt the same way about his other Zeldrate, Ol' Cronchy. Krupo, Yarvok's beast wrangler, lost Spike along with several of Yarvok's other pets after a ship with the pets crashed on the remote world of Dantooine, angering Yarvok immensely. Yarvok said he would kill Krupo if his missing pets, including Spike, were not returned quickly, as Yarvok believed them to be terrified out alone on Dantooine without him.\nSpike was mentioned in the Codex entry for Invasive Species on Dantooine in the 2019 expansion Onslaught to the 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic by the company BioWare.",
