 "content": "Lady Brezwalt III was the High Lady of House Mecetti and the leader of the Mecrosa Order during the period that climaxed in the Cleansing of the Nine Houses. She was part of a dynasty of Mecetti rulers of the Tapani Empire.\nWhen the Great Sith War erupted High Lady Brezwalt sought an opportunity to further her House's imperialistic ambitions in the sector. During Tapani Day festivities she ordered her Mecrosa Order Sith assassins to simultaneously dispose of the leaders of five of the eight rival houses. Of these only House Pelagia managed to foil the plot while the territories of Houses Calipsa, Melissus, Barong and a portion of Reena were absorbed into Mecetti Province.\nPelagia and Melantha pleaded with the Republic to intervene but their resources were stretched by the ever intensifying war waged by the Sith Lord Exar Kun. The Sith Lady Brezwalt was poised to establish unchallenged power in the Tapani sector and establish a true Mecetti Empire when Jedi Shadows from House Pelagia made their move. They had infiltrated every chapter of the Mecrosa order and when Exar Kun was defeated the Shadows sprung their trap and the Jedi Order defeated the Mecrosa order in an event that came to be known as the Cleansing of the Nine Houses. Mecetti nobles, who were anxious to save face, turned on Lady Brezwalt.\nBrezwalt spoke Basic, Bocce, High Galactic, Herglese, Malkite, Tsi, Muun and Sith. She possessed a lightfoil, Sith poison and a Sith talisman.",
