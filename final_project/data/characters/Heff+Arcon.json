 "content": "Heff Arcon was a Mon Calamari male who was active during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the war, Arcon once wired a scout ship which killed an entire room full of senators that represented themselves in the Galactic Senate of the Republic. Eventually, Arcon was captured by the Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on M'Bardi and would be shipped to Coruscant. While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Arcon was among those to cooperate and helped Ahsoka repair the outside of the ship. Skywalker thanked Arcon and the prisoners for helping and guaranteed that their aid will affect their parole.",
