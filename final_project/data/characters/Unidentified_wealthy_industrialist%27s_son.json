 "content": "During the early formation of the Galactic Empire, the Sith Lord Darth Vader murdered the son of a wealthy industrialist. As a result, the father arranged for a hit on Vader via nine assassins, eight of whom were killed.\nThe son of a wealthy industrialist worked in his father's company. In order to force employees to work harder, he would whip them himself. When his father's company had to make concessions to a Nautolan-based company, he did not like it. In an attempt to end the negotiations, he pulled out a blaster to kill the Nautolans, but Darth Vader, who was overseeing the arrangements, used his lightsaber to deflect the shot back at the son, killing him.\nAfter his son's death, the industrialist hired nine assassins to kill Vader.",
