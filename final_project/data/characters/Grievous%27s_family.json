 "content": "The Kaleesh warrior Qymaen jai Sheelal, later known by the name of Grievous, was born on the planet Kalee located in Wild Space to a family of his flesh and blood father and mother.\nA male Kaleesh named Qymaen jai Sheelal was born during the midst of a near-constant Kaleesh war against the Yam'rii of Huk, an insect species from the same system. When the Yam'rii focused on Kalee, the results were horrifying after ruthlessly invading many planets in their sector, plundering their resources and selling their inhabitants as slaves. The Kaleesh became a victim of their enemies, technologically superior to their race. Sheelal's father taught him how to use an Czerka Arms Outland rifle, and by the age of eight, he had killed at least 40 enemies. In time, the Kaleesh began to view him as a legendary figure.\nPrior to the Clone Wars, Sheelal, who had the ability to excite and motivate his people, led them in a ruthless war against the Yam'rii and became one of his people's greatest military leaders. He had earned a bloody reputation. Eventually, Qymaen jai Sheelal took the name \"Grievous\" and quickly rose through the ranks to become a warlord. Grievous was obsessed with war glory, valuing bravery in battle above everything else. Over his lifetime, he had toppled nations, killed kings, and murdered legends.\nFor years, Grievous has been fighting with the Kaleesh's strongest warriors, the Izvoshra. The Kaleesh forces drove the Huks from their world with renewed ferocity and determination, but then this species did something unexpected and asked for help from the Republic. When the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order had intervened and sided with the Yam'rii, hundreds of thousands of Kaleesh died from starvation, which led Grievous to develop a personal vendetta against them.\nDooku, Count of Serenno, and Darth Sidious, his Sith Master, saw potential in him. Grievous' hatred for the Republic and the Jedi drove him to join the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and became an agent. His request to have his loyal Izvoshra bodyguards was rejected, and were replace with IGBC droids to command, which he despised. Until Dooku commission the creation of the IG-100 Magnaguards, when Grievous demands for a more intelligent bodyguard. He was formidable in his activities and soon became one of IGBC's most valuable assets. By then, his actions had attracted the attention of Count Dooku, who had important plans for him.\nDooku betrayed Grievous, who arranged a shuttle crash by sabotaged his shuttle that destroyed the majority of his organic Kaleesh body, resulting in the warrior's injuries and transformation.\nGrievous chose to undergo cybernetic upgrades, and over time, Grievous introduced profound changes to his cybernetic body, gradually trades his biological parts for upgraded mechanical ones. Thus, his assertion that he chose the modifications he introduced into his body could be considered false from a twisted perspective. Alternatively, one legend claimed his changes had been over time. Grievous claimed to view his cybernetics as improvements over a weaker organic form.\nA brilliant tactician, Grievous served as the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. He was recruited by Count Dooku to join the Separatist Movement. Despite not being Force-sensitive, Grievous, using his cybernetics and skills in Lightsaber combat, served as a Jedi hunter for the Confederacy and killed many Jedi.\nThe Kaleesh cyborg was ruthless as he invaded planets and fought Jedi in the Clone Wars, during which he was feared by the Galactic Republic. Grievous also maintained a personal fortress on Vassek 3, where he kept a pet roggwart named Gor, but the creature was killed by Jedi Kit Fisto and Nahdar Vebb when they infiltrated the lair. In 19 BBY, days after he became the Separatist Head of State after his mentor in Lightsaber combat, Count Dooku, was killed in the Battle of Coruscant, Grievous was killed during the Battle of Utapau by his nemesis, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi.",
