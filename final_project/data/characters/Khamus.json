 "content": "Khamus was a human male criminal who was heir to the Mourner's Wail Syndicate. He had a relationship with Krynthia, the heir to a rival criminal organization named the Unbroken Clan. After Khamus's lover became pregnant, the pair made plans to escape over fears of backlash from their respective parents. Khamus, though, hired a number of bounty hunters to attack a Unbroken Clan sanctuary on the planet Corellia and try and kill Krynthia to hide their entanglement.\nKhamus accompanied the other bounty hunters, threatening punishment from the Mourner's Wail syndicate if they failed. The Nautolan Nakano Lash, though, had a change of heart when Khamus prepared to murder Krynthia. The Nautolan gunned the heir down to save Krynthia, who died having Khamus's child weeks later.\nKhamus was the heir to the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, of which his father, Lord Khamdek, was the leader. At some point prior to 3 ABY, he got into a relationship with Krynthia, the heir to the Unbroken Clan, the rival criminal organization of the Mourner's Wail. Krynthia eventually became pregnant feared that her father, the Grand Leader of the Unbroken Clan would try and kill Khamus if he discovered that the Mourner's Wail heir was the father of the baby.\nKhamus and Krynthia subsequently made plans to escape. However, Khamus feared that he'd lose everything if his father learned of his and Krynthia's child, and became determined to kill his pregnant lover. He offered the Nautolan bounty hunter Nakano Lash and her crew one-hundred-thousand credits to escort him in assassinating Krynthia at the Unbroken Clan's sanctuary on the planet Corellia.\nAs the attack on the sanctuary commenced, Khamus stayed with the Lash and the human T'ongor while the bounty hunters Bossk, Beilert Valance and Boba Fett attacked the clan's guards. When Lash failed to kill a sentry from the Unbroken Clan, Khamus scorned her, threatening punishment from the Mourner's Wail Syndicate if she failed. After Bossk, Valance and Fett dealt with the guards, Lash breached the door to the sanctuary with a grenade. Khamus then followed Lash into the sanctuary with T'ongor, with Bossk guarding the entrance.\nAs the group approached Krynthia's position, Khamus rushed past the Nautolan to kill his lover. Lash told the Mourner's Wail heir to wait as Krynthia questioned what he was doing. Khamus explained that he was at risk of losing everything over their child, preparing to kill his lover. Lash, having a change of heart, then gunned down Khamus. T'ongor informed the other bounty hunters of the heir's death, and Fett claimed Lash had essentially gotten them killed by shooting Khamus. After Krynthia further explained her and Khamus's situation to Lash, the Nautolan and T'ongor brought the Unbroken Clan heir out of the sanctuary.\nKrynthia died in childbirth some weeks after Khamus's death, leaving their child, named Cadeliah, orphaned. The Mourner's Wail Syndicate did not forget Khamus' death. Lash's actions destroyed the uneasy truce between the Unbroken Clan and the Syndicate, sending the two organizations back into war. Khamdek believed that Lash had conspired with the Clan to murder his son, forcing the Nautolan to go into hiding for some time. When she finally resurfaced near the mining world Kessel, many bounty hunters, including those she betrayed on Corellia, sought Lash out.\nKhamus was a human male with blond hair and light skin. Although he was the heir to the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, he engaged in a relationship with the heir to the Unbroken Clan, which was a rival to his syndicate. With his lover, Krynthia, being pregnant, Khamus feared that having a baby with rival blood would lose him everything if his father, Khamdek found out. Despite planning to escape with Krynthia over her own fears around the issue, he became to determined to kill her to hide their entanglement. During the assassination mission, Khamus used his status as a threat against Nakano Lash in case she messed up during the fighting.\nKhamus wore black clothing with dark shaded armor and a purple cape. Khamus also possessed a blaster pistol.\nKhamus first appeared, through flashbacks, in Bounty Hunters 1, a comic written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Paolo Villanelli, and published by Marvel Comics on March 11, 2020.",
