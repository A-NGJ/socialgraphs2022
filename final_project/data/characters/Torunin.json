 "content": "Torunin was a female Tarasin, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nTorunin was a member of the Wyrd, a group of Tarasin Force witches that operated on Cularin. The Tarasin Savina was her bodyguard.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Torunin was present on Cularin in the central hut of the village where the Zhadorii irstat lived, when she was attacked by the heroes of Cularin.\nIn Hunting the Wyrd the identity of the Wyrd sister and bodyguard that the player characters fight in the central hut varies, depending on player level. High-level players fight Torunin and Savina, but Mid-Level players fight Naelora and Kosaa instead, while Upper-Level players face Baeshana and Veshin. It is also possible for the players to avoid the hut, so the fight against Torunin doesn't even have to take place.",
