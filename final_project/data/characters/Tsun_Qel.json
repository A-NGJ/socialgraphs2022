 "content": "Tsun Qel was a member of the Shaper caste of the Yuuzhan Vong. A Shaper Initiate of Domain Qel, he went to Yavin 4, to look in on the shaping of Tahiri Veila. He told Shaper Adept Nen Yim that he had been sent by Mezhan Kwaad herself, and made mention of Yakun Kwaad, a former shaper apprentice and Nen's dead lover, as evidence. Convinced, she told Qel of everything that Kwaad and Yim had performed. In truth, however, Tsun Qel had been sent by Master Shaper Yal Phaath to investigate whether or not they had performed heresy.",
