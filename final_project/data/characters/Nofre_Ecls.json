 "content": "Nofre Ecls was an Sullustan who ran Nofre Repair Bay at Gelgelar Free Port on the planet Gelgelar. She was the sister of Loro Ecls who managed Gelgelar Free Port. She was affiliated with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, but her brother did not share her sympathies, or if he did he kept it to himself.\nEcls was summoned to Drop Point: Gelgelar by Arik Stijhl to assist on getting The Maker up and running again. She was working with T'Charek Haathi to get the power grid working but told her that she would need to rewire the whole system. Haathi rejected the recommendation and suggested that they just hotwire the main engine to the power core. The Sullustan told her that it would be dangerous and could destroy the ship if there was a power spike. Haathi ordered Ecls to proceed with the repair.",
