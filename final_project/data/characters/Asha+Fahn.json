 "content": "Asha Fahn was a female Ewok of the Bright Tree tribe on Endor. Along with Teebo, she was one of Chief Chirpa's best hunters. When Chirpa decided to aid the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, Asha and Teebo gave him their support, which allowed him to completely overrule the veto of Logray, the tribe's shaman. The next morning, Asha, Chirpa and Teebo led the Ewoks who were able to join the fight into the forest, while the young and the elderly stayed at the village. When the Ewoks assaulted the Empire's bunker, Asha led the fiercest warriors of the tribe. She and her men leapt from atop the bunker, and the huntress killed an Imperial officer with her knife, leaving him no time to shout a command to his troopers. After the Battle of Endor was won both on ground and in space, Asha was part of the revelries that took place at Bright Tree Village.\nThe Ewok huntress Asha was created by Paul Dini for the Ewoks animated TV series. That series is part of Star Wars Legends, previously known as the Expanded Universe, and is therefore not canon. However, Asha was canonized by her inclusion in Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!, Tom Angleberger's retelling of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.",
