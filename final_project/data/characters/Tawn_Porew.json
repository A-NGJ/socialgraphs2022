She also attempted to blow up his house, but was captured and imprisoned. Eventually, she was liberated by the local underground Rebel cell. Tawn was talented when it came to demolitions, and the Rebels were so impressed by her skills that they offered her a place in the Rebel Alliance. She accepted and received training at a secret Rebel base. Once the training was complete she was assigned to Commander Brion Peck's unit on Rafft where she met and befriended the smugglers Dannen Lifehold and Purr.",
