 "content": "Oron Wintree was a Human male lieutenant who served in the Royal Security Forces during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nLieutenant Oron Wintree is listed as a non-player character in the directory tree files for the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. However, he was merely one of many other NPCs cut from actual inclusion on the live servers. Nonetheless, an emulated depiction of Lieutenant Wintree reveals what he would have looked like, had he been included. The tree files also point to him being a member of the Royal Naboo Security Forces.",
