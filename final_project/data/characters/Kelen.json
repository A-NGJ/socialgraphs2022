 "content": "Kelen was a fair-skinned, brown-eyed, male Human who held the rank of private in the military of the noble House Organa during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war, he served House Organa on the planet Alderaan, where he was stationed in the market section of House Organa's estate in the Apalis Coast region. At the market, he worked selling a range of weapons from a table to other Republic individuals, where he carried a blaster rifle and wore armor that included a helmet.\nPrivate Kelen appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Kelen was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
