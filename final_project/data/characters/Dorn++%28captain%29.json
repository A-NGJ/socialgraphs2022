 "content": "Dorn was a Human male captain who served in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War. He was the son of Governor Vikar Dorn of Munto Codru and the commanding officer of the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Dauntless. In 137 ABY, he and his crew pretended to defect to Roan Fel's faction of the Galactic Empire based in the planet Bastion. The defection was part of a plot devised by Darth Maladi, head of Sith Intelligence and Assassination to allow the Sith Lord Darth Kruhl to infiltrate the Imperial Headquarters and assassinate Emperor Fel. After Lord Kruhl failed and the plot was exposed, Dorn and his entire crew were executed.",
