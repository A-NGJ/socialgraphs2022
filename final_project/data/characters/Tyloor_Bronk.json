 "content": "Tyloor Bronk was a male Kedorzhan who was one of the seven children of the Galactic Republic Senator, Dewell Bronk. Tyloor gave his life fighting for the Republic in the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems which lasted from 22 BBY until 19 BBY. After his death, his body was not recovered from the battlefield where he fell. The loss of his son was one of the factors which drove Dewell to sign the Petition of 2000, a document condemning the actions of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the war.\nTyloor Bronk was first mentioned in \"Incognito,\" a short story published in the Star Wars Insider magazine's 143rd issue on July 23, 2013. The story was written by John Jackson Miller as a tie in to his novel Kenobi.",
