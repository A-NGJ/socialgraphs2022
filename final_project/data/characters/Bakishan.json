 "content": "Bakishan was a male Twi'lek constable for the Tatooine city of Anchorhead during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nBakishan lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.A constable for the city of Anchorhead, he was stymied by a string of robberies. The thieves had even stolen the state-of-the-art police surveillance holocameras that he had set up to catch them.\nHe asked a Republic-allied individual to help stop the group, which Bakishan suspected was actually a group of astromech droids. Astromech droids had been seen at every robbery, and no one was able to identify the thieves themselves. The individual recovered a transmitter from one of the droids and followed the trail to Izink, a Jawa outside of Anchorhead. The individual convinced the Jawa to turn himself in to Bakishan, ending the string of thefts.\nBakishan was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He gives Republic players the Tatooine mission \"Astromenace\", where Bakishan asks the player to investigate a string of robberies.",
