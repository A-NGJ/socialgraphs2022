 "content": "The mother of the man who became the Imperial stormtrooper TK-462 was a female human from Eriadu. She lived with her son, her daughter Xea, and her husband, who operated an air scrubber farm. Contrary to her husband, who knew nothing about physics, the mother of TK-462 loved science, and she passed on that love to her son. She notably gave him a number of science books that he came to know by heart.",
