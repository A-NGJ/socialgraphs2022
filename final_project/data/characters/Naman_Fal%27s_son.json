 "content": "Naman Fal's son was a male Human who attended the Sith Academy on Korriban during the Cold War. Considered to be weak in the dark side, Naman Fal's son was very friendly and talkative during his time in the academy. His father believed he would never be talented as a Sith, however, the son wanted to prove himself to his father that he was a Sith. During his trial, he traveled to the Tomb of Naga Sadow where he met sentry Yashia who was guarding the tomb. After the acolyte was killed and never returned, Yashia grew worried and decided to send a Sith Acolyte to find the body and return it to Naman Fal.",
