 "content": "Brion Peck was a Rebel Alliance commando shrouded in mystery.\nPeck and his team were sent to Rafft shortly before the Battle of Yavin, tasked with sabotaging the Imperial garrison on the planet. Their mission went poorly, however, when a homing beacon attached to their ship gave them away to the Imperials. Fortunately for Peck, Dannen Lifehold, a former smuggler and mercenary, saved them. Brion disliked Lifehold, however, because the woman he loved, Beka Lewis, was killed several years earlier by mercenaries.",
