 "content": "Stolak Vandello was a Balosar male criminal and former member of Black Sun. He met fellow Balosar R'Tess on their homeworld of Balosar and fell in love with her. At some point during the New Republic Era, Vandello borrowed a number of credits from Black Sun to get away from Balosar and for R'Tess to have a better life away from the pollution of Balosar. The two then made their way to the Star Cruiser Halcyon, where they hoped to see sungrazer-comet, which R'Tess had dreamed of seeing, collide with the star Daca. Eventually, the crew of the bounty hunter T'onga were sent by Black Sun to capture or kill Vandello. Vandello eventually surrended to the bounty hunters, though he was allowed to witness the collision with his lover before being taken by T'onga's crew to Black Sun. After he was taken, R'Tess learned that Vandello had paid for their room on the Halcyon for up to a century.",
