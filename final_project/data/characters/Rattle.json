 "content": "\"Rattle\" was a clone trooper of the Galactic Republic's Grand Army. After the Clone Wars ended and the Republic was turned into the Galactic Empire, clone soldiers were decommissioned and replaced by stormtroopers. Rattle went to live out his old days as a janitor at the Junior Academy of Applied Sciences on Lothal.\nRattle was originally intended to be included in Servants of the Empire: Edge of the Galaxy, the first installment of Jason Fry's Servants of the Empire junior novel series. He would have helped the series' protagonist, Zare Leonis, by imparting leadership lessons from the Clone Wars, which the boy would have used while playing grav-ball. However, the creative team behind the animated TV series Star Wars Rebels asked Fry to get rid of the character, warning that it would scoop a storyline they were developing for the show's second season.",
