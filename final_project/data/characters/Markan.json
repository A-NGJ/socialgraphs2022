 "content": "Markan was Human male who achieved the rank of assistant Overseer in the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War, between them and the Galactic Republic. Markan worked in the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban during the war, and whilst there served under Sith such as Darth Zash. Zash ordered him to direct acolytes training at the academy to instructors in the archives, who would teach them martial skills. One acolyte he directed to the instructors was the Sith Inquisitor who would go on to become Zash's apprentice, who Markan directed to the Sith Lord Samus.\nHe saw aliens as inferior to Humans and members of the Sith species, but tolerated them under orders from his superiors.\nHe had pale skin, green eyes, black hair and whilst working in the academy he wore black and red robes.\nMarkan first appeared in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, in which he played a part in the quest \"A Fighting Chance\". The quest was for the Sith Inquisitor class only and directed them to a class trainer. If the player is a non-Human or Sith species Markan will comment on how disgusting he finds them. He is voiced by Nolan North.",
