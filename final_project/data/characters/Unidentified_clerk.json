 "content": "A human male worked as a clerk at the city hall of Mos Espa for Mayor Mok Shaiz around 9 ABY. When Daimyo Boba Fett, who believed Shaiz had arranged an assassination attempt on him, arrived to see the mayor, the clerk, working at the front desk, failed to find any arranged appointments with Shaiz for the Daimyo. The mayor's majordomo soon intervened and took over speaking to Fett's group. The clerk was at his desk when Fett returned to see Shaiz again, watching the subsequent exchange between the Daimyo and the majordomo, who attempted to flee thereafter.\nAround 9 ABY, the human male worked as a clerk in the city hall of Mos Espa, a city on the desert planet of Tatooine. Employed by the city's Mayor Mok Shaiz, he worked at the front desk at the city hall's entrance, keeping log of appointments visitors had with the mayor. After the new Daimyo of Tatooine Boba Fett was attacked by the Order of the Night Wind, he was led to believe that Shaiz was responsible by a Night Wind assassin he had captured.\nFett entered the city hall with three associates, including Master Assassin Fennec Shand, and the captive Night Wind assassin, the Daimyo introducing himself and his purpose of seeing the mayor. The clerk looked up \"Boba Fett\" in the schedule of Shaiz's appointments, unable to find any match, so he asked the visitor if he had arranged one. Fett only explained the reason for his presence, and so the clerk begun saying how the Daimyo was not in the schedule until Shaiz's Twi'lek majordomo stepped in, speaking with Fett's group instead. The conversation ultimately ended with Fett forcing to Shaiz to confront the mayor.\nNot long after, Shaiz promised the Pyke Syndicate control over his territory. Word quickly reached Fett of the matter, who chose to pay the mayor a visit again. The clerk and Shaiz's majordomo were at the desk when Fett and Shand came through the entrance, demanding to the majordomo to see Shaiz. The clerk watched as the Twi'lek anxiously tried to give excuses to the Daimyo, nudging the clerk back to reach for the desk console. The man then witnessed as the majordomo tried to escape by lying to Fett and locking the door behind him, only for the Daimyo and Shand to realize the Twi'lek was trying to get away and leave the building after him.\nA human male, the clerk had light skin, long, brown hair with a mustache, and brown eyes. While Boba Fett tried to create an aura of power around him as the new Daimyo, the clerk maintained his standard approach with visitors. When Fett and Fennec Shand arrived a second time, the clerk appeared more anxious, repeatedly looking over to the majordomo as the Twi'lek tried to talk his way out of the situation.\nThe clerk wore white and black uniform with a brown leather belt across his body that included a pouch and a black hat.\nThe clerk first appeared in \"Chapter 2: The Tribes of Tatooine,\" the second episode of the television series The Book of Boba Fett, which released on Disney+ on January 5, 2022. The clerk was played by Galen Howard.",
