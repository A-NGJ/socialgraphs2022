 "content": "Erinn Bonette was a Human female Rogue CorSec officer who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Bonette and fellow Rogue CorSec officer Echdo Bervekk worked with another criminal, the Meatlump lieutenant Kaiya Merel. Merel dispatched a new Meatlump recruit to help them hijack a shuttle. However, the Meatlump recruit was in fact a spacer working for the Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr who was investigating the Meatlumps. The spacer met the two Rogue CorSec officers near Coronet and attacked them. Erinn Bonette and Echdo Bervekk were killed in the confrontation.\nErinn Bonette appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Erinn Bonette was added to the game with the update dubbed \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008.\nThis non-player character  was known in the game as either Erinn Bonette or Berinn Ebonette, depending of the Combat Level  of the player. If the player performed the quest \"The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 6\" during the leveling of their character , the NPC would be named Erinn Bonette. If the player performed the quest after the end of the game , the NPC would be named Berinn Ebonette. Multiple story elements indicated that the quest was intended to be achieved at CL 65.",
