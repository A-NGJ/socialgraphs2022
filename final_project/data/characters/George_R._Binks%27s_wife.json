 "content": "George R. Binks's wife was a female Otolla Gungan. George R. Binks chose to marry her not out of love, but because she had the ability to bear him an heirâ€”Jar Jar Binks.\nAt a young age, Jar Jar showed signs of clumsiness, much to his father's disappointment. When George took his family whaling with him, Jar Jar's clumsiness resulted in a near-fatal shipwreck. Angered at Jar Jar, George attempted to trick him into swimming for help, knowing that Jar Jar would die in the attempt, but his wife stopped him. George was so overcome with despair that he attempted suicide, which failed, as he awoke a short time later.",
