 "content": "Fozec was a human male who worked as a guard at the palace of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure on the planet Tatooine. In 4 ABY, he watched a performance of the song \"Jedi Rocks\" by the Max Rebo Band and laughed when it ended with the enslaved dancer Oola being eaten by Jabba's pet rancor, Pateesa.\nHe witnessed Princess Leia Organa arrive at the palace disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, but after she freed the smuggler Han Solo from captivity, Fozec helped capture her and Solo and took the smuggler to one of the palace's cells. After the prisoners' ally Luke Skywalker arrived at the palace and slew Pateesa, Fozec marched Skywalker back up from the rancor pit to stand before Jabba, who sentenced him and his allies to death.\nFozec then traveled to the Great Pit of Carkoon on board Jabba's sail barge, Khetanna, drinking with the Snivvian Geezum and the Ugnaught Yoxgit during the journey. At the pit, Jabba tried to have Skywalker and his allies fed to the sarlacc that lived there, but the prisoners turned the tables on Jabba and his allies, killing the Hutt, destroying the sail barge, and escaping.\nThe human male Fozec worked as a guard at the palace of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure on the desert planet Tatooine. In 4 ABY, Fozec stood behind Jabba's throne while the Hutt and his court watched a performance of the song \"Jedi Rocks\" by the Max Rebo Band. After Jabba demanded the song be repeated, the Hutt tried to pull the enslaved dancer Oola closer to him, but when she resisted, he interrupted the song by dropping the dancer into a pit beneath the throne room. There, the screaming dancer was devored by Jabba's pet rancor, Pateesa, as Fozec laughed with another human court member. With Oola dead, the court's attention was drawn to the throne room entryway by the sound of blaster fire. Fozec watched while leaning on an archway behind the throne as Princess Leia Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, entered the room, pulling the Wookiee Chewbacca with her as a prisoner.\nJabba offered the twenty five thousand credit bounty he had posted on Chewbacca, but Organa asked for double that and produced an active thermal detonator to back up her demands. Fozec and many others present took cover from the explosive, but Jabba merely laughed and counter offered thirty five thousand credits, which Organa accepted before allowing Chewbacca to be taken away. The princess's real reason for being in the palace was to free the smuggler Han Solo, who Jabba kept frozen in carbonite on one of the throne room's walls, and later that night she snuck back in and released Solo. Jabba, however, had seen through Organa's disguise and set a trap. Once Solo was free, Jabba had several curtains in the throne room pulled back, revealing the Hutt and his court lying in wait. Fozec was among those that had been hiding, and emerged with a Gamorrean guard to capture Solo, escorting him to the palace dungeons as the captive Organa was brought closer to the Hutt.\nWhile Jabba and his courtiers were later resting, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker arrived to rescue Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca. Skywalker used a mind trick on Jabba's majordomo Bib Fortuna and persuaded him to let him into the throne room and awake Jabba. Once the Hutt and the rest of the court began to awaken, Fozec emerged behind Jabba's throne and took position with his weapon. Skywalker demanded Jabba free his friends and threatened the Hutt with a blaster pistol when Jabba refused. The crime lord then dropped Skywalker into the rancor pit, but the Jedi slew the beast and Fozec and Lando Calrissian, another disguised ally of Skywalker, dragged him from the pit back up to the throne room. Solo and Chewbacca were also brought out, and Fozec stood with his weapon ready behind the prisoners as Jabba sentenced them to death at the Great Pit of Carkoon. He then marched the prisoners from the throne room as a crowd of courtiers followed.\nFozec was part of the entourage that traveled with Jabba on board his sail barge, the Khetanna, on the way to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where the prisoners were to be fed to a sarlacc that lived there. The guard was stood with a drink inside the sail barge with the Ugnaught Yoxgit and the Snivvian Geezum when the astromech droid R2-D2 bumped into the protocol droid C-3PO in front of the trio and spilt the drinks he was carrying. C-3PO apologized while Yoxgit and Geezum wiped themselves down from the spill, and soon after the barge arrived at the pit. At the pit, Skywalker and his allies managed to free themselves, with Organa strangling Jabba and shutting the barge's blinds, causing chaos within. The former prisoners then destroyed the barge and escaped.\nFozec appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on a card in the Jabba's Palace Limited, an 1998 expansion to the Star Wars Customizable Card Game produced by Decipher, Inc. The name Fozec was created by pulling a handful of random titles out of a bag of Scrabble titles upon the suggestion of Decipher employee Chuck Kallenbach.",
