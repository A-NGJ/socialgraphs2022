 "content": "Mandus Fouc was an Imperial Customs officer and captain of the customs ship Impounder during the Galactic Civil War.\nA tall, handsome man, Fouc's skills and prowess had impressed high-ranking Imperial Navy officers. He was due to be transferred to a command post in the Navy shortly before the Battle of Endor. However, the chaos following the death of the Emperor resulted in Fouc's transfer not being processed, forcing him to remain a Customs officer.\nSome years after Endor, he took a prominent role in the Empire's bid to take control of the Kalinda system. The bid failed after being repulsed by the Kalindan military and smugglers secretly hired by the New Republic.",
