 "content": "Nil was a male Quint who worked for Jenna Zan Arbor. He worshiped the scientist for her brilliance, but she didn't seem to acknowledge his praise.\nWhen Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn was captured by Ona Nobis, the bounty hunter under Zan Arbor's employ, Nil was tasked with keeping the subject under watch. After a few tests, Qui-Gon distracted Nil and momentarily knocked the Quint unconscious in his escape attempt. But the Jedi was hit by a paralysis dart and Nil had brought him back to his cell. Furious at being outsmarted, Nil suggested that Qui-Gon should be killed; Zan Arbor concurred, yet decided to put that on hold.\nOnce more, Nil had been bested and fooled by a Jedi. When Astri Oddo, disguised as Ona Nobis, brought in a \"captured\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Quint became suspicious. Obi-Wan wasted no time in using Nobis' stolen whip to trap Nil and dumped him in an empty holding cell before he and Astri could rescue Qui-Gon.\nWhen Zan Arbor had to run away after being discovered by the Jedi, Nil was no longer useful and she injected him with a lethal poison.",
