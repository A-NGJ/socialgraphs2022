 "content": "Ingah Muloha was a Human female who served as a commanding officer of an Imperial stormtrooper garrison on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. Troopers under her command discovered a Bafforr tree grove created by Momaw Nadon in the desert and informed Muloha. She contacted a local Imperial sympathizer, crime lord Centa Sonhan, and had her subordinates pin false charges on Nadon and had him apprehended. She was killed aboard Centa Sohan's sail barge, when it was attacked by agents of the Rebel Alliance trying to free Nadon.",
