 "content": "An unidentified individual served as the Shadow Hand of the last King of the Sith Hakagram Graush circa 6900 BBY. As a Shadow Hand, they acted as the king's second-in-command and most trusted advisor. When a group of fallen Jedi Exiles set foot on Korriban, the sacred planet of the Sith, the Shadow Hand betrayed their master. He or she helped the powerful strangers lure the Sith monarch into their confidence and kill him. It took weeks for the offworlders to understand the power structure of the Sith society and successfully undermine it from within. It was Ajunta Pall, the leader of the Exiles, who eventually beheaded King Graush with the monarch's own war sword. After Hakagram Graush's death, Pall took the mantle of King and appointed his fellow Dark Jedi as his new Shadow Hands.\nKing Graush's right-hand person was first mentioned in Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties, an article originally written by Abel G. Pe√±a as an exclusive Hyperspace publication and later published in the eighty-eighth issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine. In the 2012 reference book Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side, written by Daniel Wallace, Graush's Shadow Hand went unmentioned. However, the book does mention that the Jedi Exiles dismantled the Sith society from within.",
