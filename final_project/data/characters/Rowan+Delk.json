Rowan saw how noble and bright he was as a Jedi Master, but when he suffered from a terrible plague that Lord Vivicar formed, he became insane which displeased Rowan until he got himself sick. Despite his illness, Rowan Delk met with a Jedi Consular who was here to search for Master Vossan. He suggested in meeting at a settlement named Malcolm's Dunes in the Dune Sea of the desert planet. After meeting at the settlement, he and the Consular found a message from Master Vossan, in which he claimed to be searching for the ultimate species of warriors after seeing a vision. Rowan was present with the Jedi Consular when he shielded Master Vossan from the illness, curing him.",
