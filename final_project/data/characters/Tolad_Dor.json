 "content": "Tolad Dor was an Ithorian gangster active in the Nilg system.\nAt some point of its career, Dor made a contract with Ostan Atur, a Lowen saboteur from Low'n, with whom the Ithorian worked for nearly two years. In addition to disabling equipment, breaching security and rigging detonators, she crippled many starships, allowing Dor's minions to collect goods from stores and sell them on the invisible market. She was an invaluable part of Dor's growing syndicate until she left.",
