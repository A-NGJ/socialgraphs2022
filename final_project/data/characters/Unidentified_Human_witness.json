 "content": "This Human worked as a mechanic for the Jedi Order, in the hangar of the Jedi Temple around 20 BBY.\nAfter a bomb went off in the hangar, this human male was taken to the hospital. As a 2-1B surgical droid was operating on him, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano asked this worker if he had witnessed anything strange before the explosion. The worker answered that everything seemed okay, and whisperingly asked if it was true that a Jedi was responsible for the bombing. Ahsoka replied that they didn't know anything for sure by then.",
