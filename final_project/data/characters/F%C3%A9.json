 "content": "Fé was a female Human who served as a handmaiden to Queen Amidala in Theed. In 32 BBY, she was present during the celebrations held in the wake of the Invasion of Naboo.\nFay David stood in as Padmé's handmaiden for some pickup shots that were used for the celebration scene at the end of The Phantom Menace.\nWhile Fay was probably just standing in for an already existing handmaiden, she surmised that the handmaiden was \"perhaps named Fé,\" a new character entirely.\nAn update of the original Databank, titled \"The Women of Star Wars,\" confirmed Fé's status as a canon and separate character.",
