 "content": "Relgar Carrae, also known as the Carbine, was a male Near-Human who worked as a pilot during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. Carrae raced for the Hutt Cartel in the Cloud City Grand Prix alongside his co-pilot Garulo. He was well known to be a violent and dangerous individual.\nRelgar Carrae was a male member of an unidentified Near-Human species who worked as a pilot during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. Rumored to have previously been a pirate, he was sponsored by anonymous members of the Hutt Cartel closely linked to Kaltho the Hutt to take part in the Cloud City Grand Prix, a cloud car racing event held around Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Carrae, who was considered the most dangerous pilot taking part in the race, made the news several times in the weeks leading up to the event by being thrown out of high-profile casinos and engagements around Cloud City for his behavior. While in Cloud City his cloud car was kept in a private berth which was constantly observed by electronic surveillance equipment to prevent sabotage. Flying with his Xexto co-pilot Garulo, Carrae attempted to fly as fast as possible for as long as possible during the race, although ultimately he lost to a team of spacers hired by the Pantoran criminal Arend Shen.\nCarrae was renowned for his violent behavior, although some suspected this was partially due to his extensive facial tattooing and various unnatural augmentation. During the race he showed little inhibition and simply went as fast as he could.\nCarrae carried a heavy blaster pistol.\nCarrae first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire in 2014 by Fantasy Flight Games. This article assumes that the players won the Grand Prix, but makes no assumptions about Carrae's progress during the race other than his loss. It is also possible for players to attempt to sabotage Carrae's ship but this is entirely optional and so again the article makes no assumptions about it happening.",
