 "content": "Vipp was a female Nautolan science officer serving aboard the Theoretika, a research vessel operated by the Czerka Corporation. One of the ship's primary projects in its final years of activity was a bioengineered jurgoran specimen labeled Specimen Gamma 19. During her autopsy of Orgglo's remains, Vipp determined that the specimen had consumed Orgglo down to even the marrow, prompting Vipp to place the creature in suspended animation. Around a century before 3639 BBY, the Theoretika was damaged during its hyperspace jump and ended up in an asteroid belt in the Unknown Regions, causing a major hull breach on the port side of Deck 5, and its crew slowly turned on each other. The crew died out in a variety of accidents, though most of the crew was killed when the ship's medical droid reclassified the Theoretika's remaining food stores as an infestation and destroyed them with its pesticide protocols.\nScience Officer Vipp appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic in hologram during the \"Theoretika\" mission.",
