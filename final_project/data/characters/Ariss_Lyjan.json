 "content": "Ariss Lyjan was an Imperial Moff who governed Nuiri sector in the Outer Rim Territories during the Galactic Civil War.\nAriss was notorious for his gambling habits, which often got him into financial as well as political trouble. He was considered a friend of Grand Moff Tarkin, and his friend's influence kept him in a favorable position within the Empire as well as allowing him access to the exclusive Sabre Club, a VIP club of the Ace of Sabres casino that he frequented.\nA gambler at heart he would often take risks and use gambits when dealing with political maneuvers or strategic military situations that most other Imperial officers would never dare to use. He was also overly confident in his skills which could be exploited such as when he lost 50,000 credits to Lando Calrissian.\nAs a Moff Ariss had the power and influence of an entire sector behind him. He was an above average leader skilled in both command and government bureaucracy. Whether because of his personal wealth or because of his political influence he had a 25,000 credit line open when he was at the casino.\nAriss Lyjan was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.",
