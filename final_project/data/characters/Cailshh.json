 "content": "Cailshh was a sly and unpredictable Ubese mercenary who was hired by Lik Ankkit on Qiilura. Cailshh's sex was unknown, though Ghez Hokan believed it was a male. Cailshh was ordered by Hokan to search for the Republic spies. Cailshh and his or her men torched every single farm in their path, but Hokan wasn't too pleased with this. Hokan beheaded Cailshh with Kast Fulier's lightsaber as punishment and a warning to the rest of his crew, then ordered Mukit, a fellow Ubese, to bury him or her in the proper Ubese manner.",
