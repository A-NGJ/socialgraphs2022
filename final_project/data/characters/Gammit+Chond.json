 "content": "Gammit Chond was a male Ithorian artist. Although he never traveled offworld , Chond created a set of hand-drawn planetary maps based on many travelers' tales he had heard. His maps, although not strictly accurate, were in fact attempts at reproducing the feel of the worlds they depicted. Eventually, some of Chond's work found its way to the Graf Archive on Orchis 2, where they were exhumed from the Shadow Stacks by a lucky archivist. Other works purported to be from Chond about alien species were unearthed by the archivist droid TR-33NA; due to their advanced age, much of it was faded, although what was recovered was published with added data points.\nGammit Chond was first mentioned in the canon reference book Star Wars: Galactic Atlas, as the in-universe author of the text. The name is an anagram for Tim McDonagh, the illustrator for Star Wars: Galactic Atlas and Star Wars: Alien Archive.",
