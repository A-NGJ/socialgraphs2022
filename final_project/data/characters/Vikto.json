 "content": "Vikto was a male Zabrak Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A fair-skinned man with brown eyes, no hair, and a ritual facial tattoo, Vikto wore brown robes over armor, and spent much of his time on the space stations Carrick Station and Keylander Station. He also accompanied Republic forces at the Czerka Corporation facility CZ-198 during the seizure of the facility.\nMaster Vikto first appeared as a PvP gear vendor for Jedi Knights in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. However, with the reorganization of the gear system that accompanied Game Update 2.0 and the release of the Rise of the Hutt Cartel Digital Expansion, Vikto was changed to a Basic Gear Vendor who could found on Carrick Station, Keylander Station, and CZ-198. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
