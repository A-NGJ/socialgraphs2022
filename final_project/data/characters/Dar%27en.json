 "content": "Dar'en was a Lupr'or female who lived on the planet Luprora around the time of the Battle of Starkiller Base. She served as a guide for the First Order visitors Captain Phasma and TN-3465 during the hunt for Lieutenant Sol Rivas. Dar'en helped them to salvage technology from an ancient Lupr'or starship. Dar'en later participated in Phasma's assault on the R'ora stronghold.\nDar'en was an adult Lupr'or woman who lived during the New Republic Era. She lived in the Lupr'or village, which was the home of remaining Lupr'or who had survived the rising sea levels and the threat of the aquatic Tsw'ells and the R'ora. She brought Captain Phasma, TN-3465, and the droid BB-K8 before the village leader Jair'i. After recounting the bleak history of the Lupr'or, Jair'i told them that their \"friend\" Lieutenant Sol Rivas and that he would be dead soon. After Phasma refused to accept the assumption that Rivas would be killed, she was told that Dar'en would take her and TN-3465 to where the creatures would keep Rivas so they could see how futile it was.\nDar'en brought Captain Phasma and TN-3465 to the R'ora stronghold, which lay in a lake surrounded by tsw'ell monsters. As Phasma bent down at the water's edge to study the site, Dar'en warned her that they should depart because it was dangerous to be close to the water's edge. When Phasma asked if the creatures had a sleep cycle, Dar'en told her that the creatures slept in the early hours of the morning but for long.\nDar'en accompanied Captain Phasma, TN-3465, and Ali'ane's great granddaughter to the home of her great grandmother Ali'ane. While Captain Phasma questioned Ali'ane about the source of her great granddaughter's necklace, Dar'en waited with TN-3465. Later, Dar'en accompanied Phasma, TN-3465, and Ali'ane's great granddaughter to an abandoned Lupr'or starship, the only one that had not been claimed by the sea.\nReturning to the village, Dar'en misunderstood TN-3465's message to bring everyone, thinking that she only needed to bring the men. Dar'en was present when TN-3465 argued with BB-K8 and told the droid to correct its mistake at the expense of looking stupid. Shortly later, Captain Phasma delivered a rousing speech urging the Lupr'or to fight for their survival against the R'ora. Captain Phasma came up with a plan to neutralize the tsw'ells surrounding the island stronghold by electrocuting them with generators recovered from the ship.\nAfter rowing across the lake, Dar'en climbed with Phasma and TN-3465 up the cliff overlooking the battlements of the R'ora stronghold. While climbing the cliff, Phasma experienced flashback of climbing with Torben, Frey, and Siv. While Dar'en and her people fought the R'ora, Phasma snuck away and killed Rivas, concealing her role in the destruction of Starkiller Base. Deeming the Lupr'or unfit to survive the planet's evolution, Phasma abandoned D'aren and her people to the R'ora and Luprora's brutal environment.\nDar'en was a Lupr'or woman with green skin, black hair, and green eyes. She was a head taller than Jair'i, the leader of the Lupr'or. She spoke Lupre'en. Dar'en was a dutiful and loyal guide who served Captain Phasma and TN-3465 well. She was also a good climber. Dar'en was also capable of combat and took part in the assault on the R'ora stronghold. She blue overalls with a white collar and red straps.\nDar'en first appeared in Star Wars: Captain Phasma, a 2017 four-issue comic published by Marvel Comics as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional material. She was created by Kelly Thompson, illustrated by Marco Checchetto, and colored by Andres Mossa.",
