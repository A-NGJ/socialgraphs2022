 "content": "A human female came into possession of some valuable shards on the Outer Rim Territories planet Carajam between 2 BBY and 4 ABY. She took the shards to a desert camp belonging to the criminals Zingo Gabnit and Turfitch, who took them and planned to kill the human, begging for her life. Gabnit rejected her supplication, reasoning that she could not be allowed to live while knowing his name. The human promised not to share any details, but Gabnit assured her that this would be the case regardless.\nFurther pleading was interrupted when the human spotted an approaching figure in the distance. Gabnit and Turfitch panicked, recognizing the figure as the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett. The human used the ensuing confusion to escape into the desert, laughing as she ran. She had long black hair, light skin, and blue eyes, and wore a brown outfit consisting of pants, a singlet, a vest, and a gray helmet.\nThe human was first pictured in an article published on StarWars.com on April 15, 2019, providing a preview for the one-shot comic Age of Rebellion - Boba Fett 1. The comic was published by Marvel Comics on May 8, 2019, written by Greg Pak and pencilled by Marc Laming,",
