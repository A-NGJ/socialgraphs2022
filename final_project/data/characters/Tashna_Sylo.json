 "content": "Tashna Sylo was a Human and the spouse of Griggen Sylo. The two owned a large farm in the outback of the Outer Rim planet Dantooine in the waning years of the Galactic Republic, a farm that had been in the Sylo family for ten generations. In order to supply a larder to feed their family of seven children and to sell offworld, the couple worked hard to harvest tritacale and yot beans. Between the years 30 BBY and 31 BBY, the youngest of the Sylo children, Paxi, was born. By the time of the Galactic Empire, which formed in 19 BBY, the Sylo farm had been abandoned.\nTashna Sylo was mentioned as one of the parents of Paxi Sylo in the latter's original Databank entry on StarWars.com, first posted in 2004. The entry did not specify which of the two parents was the father and which was the mother. Therefore, this article assumes no specific sex for either.",
