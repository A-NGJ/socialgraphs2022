 "content": "Manex was a Human male who was the brother of Roan and the Supreme Governor of New Apsolon during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nManex was a very wealthy man and didn't bother to hide his immense riches. His favorite color was green, so he decorated his mansion with as much green as he could afford. He was suspected of murdering the former Supreme Governor, Ewane, but was found innocent later on. Manex helped Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi in their mission on New Apsolon by giving them vital information and taking care of Tahl when she was rescued. He became Acting Supreme Governor of New Apsolon after his brother's death. The Jedi apprehended the culprits for Roan's death, Ewane's twin daughters Alani and Eritha as well as the Absolute Balog. After this Manex bid farewell to the Jedi and planned to run in the upcoming election to keep his position of Supreme Governor.",
