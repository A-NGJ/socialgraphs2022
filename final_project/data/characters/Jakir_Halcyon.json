 "content": "Jakir Halcyon was a human male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the third Galactic War. He was a member of the Corellian Jedi, himself hailing from Corellia, and was slain alongside the Selonian Jedi Seldin on Corellia during the battle there.\nHalcyon was skilled in his use of the Force and could use it to slam his opponents in combat while using the Force to augment his strength to provide him with a greater advantage. He was also able to heal himself and others and could enter a healing trance to recover his strength. Halcyon was also able to sense those around him and could pinpoint disturbances in the Force.\nHalcyon wore the green traditional robes of the Corellian Jedi.",
