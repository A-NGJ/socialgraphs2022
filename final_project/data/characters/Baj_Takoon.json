 "content": "Baj Takoon was a Devaronian male criminal who was convicted of assault and murder during the Clone Wars.\nSometime around 21 BBY, Baj Takoon was captured by the Galactic Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on M'Bardi and would be shipped to Coruscant. While been guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Knowing that the ship was going to be destroyed very soon, Baj decided to join with Mell Blank to help repair the ship, allowing it to move safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid will affect their parole.",
