 "content": "t'laalak-s'lalak-t'th'ak was the Xi Charrian who designed the holographic-projector chair that Nute Gunray used to communicate with Darth Sidious.\nDuring the hunt for Darth Sidious, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker tracked him down on Charros IV in order to learn more about the mechno-chair they had discovered in Gunray's palace on Cato Neimoidia. They were forced to chase him through a large warehouse before they could catch him and ask questions, which he reluctantly answered. His answers furthered the Jedi's hunt for Sidious.\nt'laalak-s'lalak-t'th'ak signed the Neimoidian engravings made by him for the mechno-chairâ€”an act which, according to the protocol droid TC-16, could be interpreted by the Xi Char Prelate as a statement of pride.",
