 "content": "Glorzo was a Hutt individual who lived around the time of the Cold War on Nal Hutta. He collected rare technology and once owned the hologram program named Holiday but according to Tharan Cedrax, he disregarded the hologram's potential. When Glorzo decided to sell Holiday, both Cedrax and a scavenger put up offers for her so Glorzo proposed a contest between the two individuals. The buyers were to head to the Vaal asteroid field, survive for more than two minutes and bring back a stone from the asteroid Rukabi Major. The first one to succeed in this would win Holiday from Glorzo and that was Cedrax, who succeeeded days ahead of the scavenger.\nGlorzo was considered the owner of the largest, galaxy-wide collection of Rakata artifacts.",
