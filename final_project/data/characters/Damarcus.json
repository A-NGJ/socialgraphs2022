Affiliated with the House of Thul and wearing their uniform, he sold various weapons near the Thul Palace.\nDamarcus appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Imperial players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Damarcus was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors.
