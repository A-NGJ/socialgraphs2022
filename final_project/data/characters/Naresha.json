 "content": "Naresha was a humanoid female with brown hair, blue eyes, and fair skin, who lived during the reign of the Galactic Republic. She wore black robes that left her shoulders bare and carried a lightsaber.\nNaresha was a proposed character for the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 3, which was being developed by LucasArts around 2004. Concept art for the character was drawn by Cory Allemeier, before the game was canceled due to the company hitting a difficult period in its history. The information regarding the game's development was later revealed in the 2008 reference book Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts, written by Rob Smith. Rogue Leaders also included Allemeier's artwork of Naresha.",
