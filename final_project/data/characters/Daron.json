 "content": "Daron was a young native of Solem during the Galactic Civil War, and part of a resistance movement against the planetary Governor, Malvander Bren.\nBorn on Solem, Daron was a member of the planet's underground Rebel faction by 0 ABY, working alongside resistance leader and poet Yolan Bren in opposing the regime of Malvander Bren, Imperial Governor and brother of the Rebel leader.\nDespite his youth, Daron was respected for his bravery among his compatriots, singlehandedly taking down an enemy skim fighter, and providing his blood for a transfusion to save Yolan Bren's life.\nWhen the bounty hunter Boba Fett was hired by Malvander Bren to capture his brother, Daron was killed by Fett in a swoop chase while trying to protect his leader.\nDaron's sacrifice was remembered by his fellow members of the Solem resistance, with Ardal invoking his name after storming the Solem palace and rescuing Yolan Bren.",
