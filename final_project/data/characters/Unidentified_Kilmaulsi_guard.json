 "content": "A member of the Kilmaulsi species worked as a guard for the Casino Royale on the planet Vorzyd V during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 1 ABY, when Rebel agents Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker came to Vorzyd in an attempt to shut down the Galactic Empire's income from the planet's casinos, they were informed by the guard that their droid companions, C-3PO and R2-D2, wouldn't be able to accompany them into the Casino Royale, as no mechanical aid was allowed for gamblers. The guard had green and orange skin, black feathers and blue eyes.\nThe guard first appeared in the comic strip Gambler's World, which was written and illustrated by Russ Manning and distributed between between March 12 and September 8 in 1979 by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate in American and Canadian newspapers. The strip was reprinted in Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures 4 in 1994 in color, revealing the skin and eye color of the character. The guard's species was finally named in Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds, a Star Wars Roleplaying Game supplement by Wizards of the Coast.",
