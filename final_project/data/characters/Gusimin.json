 "content": "Gusimin the Honest was a male Caarite permitor working in Depatar. Unlike other permitors, Gusimin was not associated to any House, and as such was not biased to guide his customers to any specific business related to the House.\nIn 31 BBY, Gusimin approached a landing ship, hoping that the visitors would hire her as their permitor. Other prospectives included Furran, Koyi Kobad, Maltok and Sadana. All of them were disappointed to discover that they had already hired Fot Ducela.",
