 "content": "Sogan Sur was a male Zabrak criminal who was a henchman of a local crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A red-skinned humanoid, Sur carried two blaster pistols in combat, and his lieutenants were known as \"Razor Ghouls.\"\nSogan Sur appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. Sur can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon F-46, which appears on the planets Dromund Kaas, Coruscant, Tatooine, Alderaan, and Voss. The player has the option to kill him or capture him alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord he worked for, where he was encountered, and his fate. Sur's armor was later released on the Cartel Market.",
