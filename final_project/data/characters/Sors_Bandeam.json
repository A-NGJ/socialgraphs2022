 "content": "Sors Bandeam was a male Human Jedi Initiate enrolled in the Jedi Order's Temple academy on Coruscant during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Sors Bandeam was given to the Jedi Order for education in the ways of the Force. Sorted into a clan at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Initiate Bandeam remained at the Temple as many of his instructors fought and died during the Clone Wars.\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order in 19 BBY by issuing Contingency Order 66, Initiate Bandeam was present with his clan at the Temple when the 501st Legion marched up the Processional Way. Seeking refuge in the High Council Chamber high atop one of the Temple's towers, he and his peers were pleased when Jedi Anakin Skywalker walked into the chamber. Believing the famed hero was there to save them from the attacking clones, the children were caught unaware when the Jedi-turned-Sith ignited his lightsaber and slew the younglings after Sors asked Skywalker. Indeed, Skywalker had fallen to the dark side of the Force and was now known as Darth Vader.\nSors Bandeam was played by the uncredited Ross Beadman in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The character's name is actually a curious anagram of his portrayer's name.\nBeadman got the role after his mother contacted a casting agency, which sent her an e-mail saying that there was a casting call of child actors for Episode III. To prepare for the role, Beadman saw all three films of the original trilogy in VHS tapes before actually getting the part of Sors Bandeam. The character's name was created by the agency and was written in the e-mail response about Beadman getting the part. According to Beadman, the role gave him some sort of popularity back at his school as most of his classmates liked Revenge of the Sith, though his classmates were the ones who told him about his character's death, having been lied by his parents to believe that his character survived the film.\nOriginally, Sors Bandeam was to have an unspeaking part in the film, but the casting director eventually opted to have Beadman say the line \"Master Skywalker, there are too many of them! What are we going to do?\". This can be proven in the film's illustrated screenplay: there, all the younglings present at the room said the line before Anakin proceeded to slaughter them. To shoot his scene, Beadman was somewhat nervous and it took him four takes to get the scene right. During filming, Hayden Christensen shouted \"Boo!\" at Beadman, which startled him and led him to stumble back just as Christensen's character activates his lightsaber.",
