 "content": "Roarcher Ilran was a male Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A dark-skinned male with short black hair and black eyes, Roarcher sold weapons from his shop in the Anchorhead market. He sported full body armor and spoke fluent Basic.\nRoarcher appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Tatooine. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Roarcher was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games, which labeled him as \"Roacher Ilran.\"",
