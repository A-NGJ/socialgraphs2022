 "content": "Dool Pundar was a Neimoidian captain in the Trade Federation navy who deserted just prior to the blockade of Naboo and became a pirate lord. During the Clone Wars, he clashed with Breakout Squad and was captured.\nBefore turning to piracy, the Neimoidian male Dool Pundar was captain of the Profit, a Lucrehulk-class battleship in the Trade Federation fleet. As the fleet began the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, he and a few allies aboard his ship sent out a distress call, altered course and hid within a nebula far from the control of his superiors. Making use of battle droids he had reprogrammed, Pundar and his supporters gathered those of the crew still loyal to the Trade Federation and forced them into an airlock, ejecting them into space. Armed with his own force of several small support craft and battle droids, Pundar set himself up as a pirate lord.\nAfter the conclusion of the Naboo blockade, Trade Federation forces were unable to locate Pundar's \"lost\" ship. They discovered his treachery several months later, after he orchestrated several fast and lucrative raids on well-traveled hyperspace lanes, netting him more ships, crew and supplies. His forces included over one hundred Vulture droids and several YT-1300 light freighters. Pundar eluded capture by fleets sent by both the Galactic Republic and the Trade Federation, as well as numerous bounty hunters.\nIn 21 BBY, he captured a freighter belonging to Noggox the Hutt near Shipwrights' Trace. Pundar spared the crew, allowing them to eject in an escape pod. Later, Pundar and his ship, at the behest of Count Dooku, ambushed Noggox's last freighter, which was carrying droid brains, at Fondor. Pundar launched twelve of his Vulture starfighters to attack. The freighter, piloted by the young Jedi Nuru Kungurama was deliberately crashed onboard the pirate ship to allow Kungurama to capture Pundar. The Neimoidian captain ordered his crew to abandon the ship, and he himself took a cruiser to Foless. The Profit was impounded by the Fondor Shipyards personnel. On Foless, he set down outside of the spaceport to avoid detection. He planned on rendezvousing with his associate Kuvuta Pindi, who had stolen orphaned children to use as slaves. Kungurama and his ally Gizz had agreed to take Pindi, posing as the orphans' blind handler, to Foless, but the Jedi grew suspicious and chased after Pindi. He crashed into her airbus, which was piloted by Pundar, forcing it to crash. Pundar was then taken captive by Breakout Squad while Pindi was killed.\nDool Pundar was an exemplary pirate lord, ruthless, and a highly talented tactician. Like others of his species, he was a greedy individual, but he was unusually brave and willing to take risks to obtain wealth and holdings. He threatened resistance with death, but was also merciful.\nThe character of Dool Pundar first appeared in a Wizards.com article for a bounty storyline, Dool Pundar: Pirate Lord. He later appeared in 2011's The Clone Wars: Strange Allies comic.",
