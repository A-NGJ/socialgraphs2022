 "content": "Jubei was a male Weequay who, along with Gonlo, was the personal bodyguard of Saquesh in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War. When Meetra Surik arrived on Nar Shaddaa, Jubei, Gonlo, and Saquesh were all killed when Saquesh refused Surik's request to leave the refugees that he oversaw alone.\nIf the Exile has a high enough persuasion, she can convince Saquesh to give the refugees more space by claiming that one of the refugees, Geriel, has a contagious illness. This is a bluff, since in fact the Exile cures Geriel. In this instance, neither Jubei, Gonlo or Saquesh are killed.\nIf the Exile chooses to have the refugee Geriel killed by the Exchange for his illness, Saquesh will order Jubei to take care of it.",
