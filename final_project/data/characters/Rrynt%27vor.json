 "content": "Rrynt'vor was a male Nautolan warrior who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Overlord Rrynt'vor was the overseer of the Rak'qua, a tribe of bellicose Nautolan warriors that had taken control of Station Gamma, an asteroid-carved space station in the Bright Jewel system. Usually wearing a chitin armor, he led his men from his base deep down in the asteroid station. In the deepest cave, Rrynt'vor kept his pet, a giant carax named Ageaughu. In 1 ABY, a war erupted between the Rak'qua and the Car'das from neighboring Tansarii Point Station. Nevertheless, Officer Antom Moria later discovered the involvement of a local arms dealer in the outbreak of the conflict and was finally able through negotiation to convince both parties that the war was meaningless.\nRrynt'vor appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Rrynt'vor was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial\", introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005. Rrynt'vor was not involved in any quest and was only briefly mentioned in few conversations.",
