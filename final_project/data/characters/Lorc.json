 "content": "Lorc was a Klatooinian pilot who served Saw Gerrera's Partisans during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. In the year 1 BBY, Lorc accompanied Gerrera by piloting a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft during his mission to destroy the Empire's communications outpost Jalindi Station, and mission to Faos Station to find out what the Empire is secretly transporting.\nThe character Lorc was intended to appear in \"In the Name of the Rebellion,\" a two part episode that served as the third and fourth episodes of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels' fourth season, as Saw Gerrera's pilot in an earlier version of the script. To better connect to the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the pilot was changed to Edrio \"Two Tubes\", a male Tognath mercenary pilot who first appeared in Rogue One.",
