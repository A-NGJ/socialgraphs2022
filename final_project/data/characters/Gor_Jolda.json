 "content": "Gor Jolda was a Nikto male who was a low-level member of a gang during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Around 3643 BBY, Jolda sought to recruit someone outside of his gang to make a delivery.\nBy that year, an individual associated with one of the two major powers in the Cold War sent a companion to learn the details of Jolda's delivery job. The companion helped Jolda arm his followers, allowing them to depose a local crime lord. The individual's companion was rewarded greatly for assisting with Jolda's successful power play.\nGor Jolda was mentioned in the Crew Skill mission \"Mysterious Offer\" in the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
