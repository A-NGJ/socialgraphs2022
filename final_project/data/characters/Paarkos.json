 "content": "Paarkos was a male Gand living during the Cold War, who for unknown crimes was imprisoned in the Belsavis prison by the Galactic Republic. During the invasion of Belsavis around 3641 BBY he was sprung out of his cell along with three other prisoners - Chaney Barrow, Ohta and Kanjon Slyke. Their rescuer posed as a fellow inmate, but was in fact Imperial Intelligence operative Cipher Nine. The prisoners released were chosen for their skills and were asked to provide means to break into the Megasecurity Ward 23. To avoid the attention by SCORPIO security system, they came up with a plan to reprogram security droids and order them to cause havoc, thus triggering multiple alarms at different locations at once, overloading SCORPIO's capabilities. The plan eventually worked, though SCORPIO managed to disconnect herself from the network and upload her consciousness back into the droid body.",
