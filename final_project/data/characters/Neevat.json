 "content": "Neevat was a Rodian hunter living on Rodia, and a rival of Harno. In order to damage Harno's reputation, Neevat spread rumors that Harno or his associates drugged creatures before his hunts, thereby making them easier targets. Incensed by the rumors, Harno confronted Neevat; in the ensuing fight, Harno accidentally killed Neevat, and fled the planet to avoid retribution.",
