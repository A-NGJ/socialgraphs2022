During a raid on his battleship, Tuuk developed a plot with his battle droids, which consisted in drawing the ships' attackers with food and the captain to a compartment protected with ray shields.\nNuno Tuuk appeared in the 2022 videogame LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga developed by Traveller's Tales.
