 "content": "Blenks was a male Human Soldier from Alderaan and lover to General Gesselle Organa of the Galactic Republic during the time of the Cold War.\nBlenks was present with Organa, along with Kan'grell and Prinn, inside Alderaan's planetary generator, protected by a tremendously powerful force field, which was powered by siphoning off power directly from the generator. However, a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup modeâ€”cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\nBlenks, Organa, Kan'grell and Prinn encountered the Warrior after the apprentice slaughtered all of their troops. Organa decided to make an offer to the Wrath, which he refused. The Sith, who was looking for information about Organa's former handmaiden Jaesa Willsaam, started to torture Blenks, prompting Organa to reveal that the Jedi Padawan Jaesa Willsaam's parents were still servants at Castle Organa. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Wrath executed Organa and her bodyguards, including Blenks, for defying the Empire.",
