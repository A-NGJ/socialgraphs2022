 "content": "A male Twi'lek biker resided on the Galactic Republic's capital planet, Coruscant, during the Clone Wars.\nA resident of Galactic City, the Twi'lek thug was dating a Human woman early in the Clone Wars. When one of Coruscant's major power generators was bombed by agents of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, he and his girlfriend were caught outside during the mass blackout. As they approached his speeder bike to leave the pedwalk, the Senator of the Chommell sector, Padm√© Amidala, commandeered the speeder bike as she avoided two bounty hunters. As his bike was stolen, all the punk could do was exclaim out loud.",
