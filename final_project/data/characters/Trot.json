 "content": "Trot was a Lurmen male criminal who operated with Jega's Squad on the moon Nar Shaddaa. He had an inclination for removing limbs, often being held back from doing so by his associates, to his disappointment. After the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Zuckuss—with whom Trot was familiar—were defeated by fellow hunter Boba Fett on Nar Shaddaa, Zuckuss stumbled into the establishment where Trot and his crew resided. Trot spoke with Zuckuss, informing him of 4-LOM's supposed destruction at Fett's hands. However, 4-LOM had been rebuilt by Doctor Cribiriz Idollax, a former target of the two hunters; under Idollax's control, the droid arrived, intent on killing his partner. Trot and his friends fought against 4-LOM as Zuckuss tracked down and killed Idollax. Freed from Idollax's control, 4-LOM ceased the attack and departed, leaving Zuckuss alone as Trot's associates celebrated their victory.",
