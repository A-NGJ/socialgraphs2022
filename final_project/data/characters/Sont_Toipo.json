 "content": "Sont Toipo was a male Aqualish vigilante leader who worked on Drik Bandrik's payroll on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Drik Bandrik, a slaver who became upset at Kitster Banai for his persistent attempts to improve the lives of slaves, framed him in the murder of a moisture farmer named Krin Vel. Sont Toipo was then tasked with organizing an angry mob of farmers to find and kill Kitster. Fortunately for Kitster, a spacer traveling through Mos Espa agreed to help him, and hunt down Sont Toipo. Kitster surmised that the mob would consist of six or eight local moisture farmers, but he pleaded with the spacer to only kill Sont Toipo. Kitster hoped that the rest of the mob would run off after he was killed.\nThe traveler agreed, and set out to successfully kill Toipo, while making an effort to spare the lives of the farmers. It later turned out that Krin Vel was not murdered at all, but was rather paid by Drik Bandrik to leave Mos Espa long enough for a lynch mob to be formed.\nSont Toipo was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for Kitster in Mos Espa had to hunt down and kill Sont Toipo outside the city.",
