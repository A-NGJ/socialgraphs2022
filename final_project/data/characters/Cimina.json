 "content": "Lady Cimina was a Tholothian female who visited the Halcyon with her grandfather, Shorr Komrrin. When they arrived onboard the MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser was attacked by the pirate Crimson Jack.\nDuring the First Order-Resistance War, Cimina and her grandfather, Shorr Komrrin, took a trip onboard the Corellian MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser known as the Halcyon. Once on the ship, Cimina met Deethree-Ohnine, a droid that served aboard the Star Cruiser, and asked to see the Lightsaber Training Pod before being reminded by her grandfather that they should probably go to their cabin first in order to settle in. The Halcyon was eventually attacked by a group of pirates lead by Crimson Jack. Seeing Crimson Jack's starship on her window, Cimina started to get worried but D3-O9 comfort her by telling her that the Halcyon had already faced way more dangerous situations before, the droid told the young lady about another attack on the Halcyon that occurred during the High Republic Era. After hearing the story, Cimina realized that Jack's ship started firing at them.\nDespite it only being a warning shot, Cimina still expressed her fears to her grandfather. Crimson Jack contacted Captain Riyola Keevan and asked her to allowe them to take a resistance spy that was inside the Halcyon. The Captain seemingly accepted when in reality she wanted the pirate ship to get closer so they could fire at it while they traveled right into a massive solar storm to avoid counter attacks. As the Halcyon approached the solar storm, Deethree-Ohnine told Cimina and her grandfather that they needed to move towards a muster station in order to avoid the radiation. The droid told Cimina another story from the Republic Era related to the star cruiser but once again all it did was confuse her.\nWhile the Halcyon passed through the solar storm, Cimina told D3-O9 that the next story she tells should be one with action, romance and a Jedi. The droid then told the young lady a story about Anakin Skywalker and Padm√© Amidala. After the story, Cimina's grandfather told her that he'll be disembarking from the ship in order to deal with the pirates.\nCimina first appeared in Halcyon Legacy 1, a 2021 comic book written by Ethan Sacks and drawn by Will Sliney.",
