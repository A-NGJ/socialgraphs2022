 "content": "Shesstellek was a male Devaronian spice merchant active in Storrd Township on Seregar. He was extremely thin, and always seemed nervous and edgy.\nHe was an associate of the bounty hunter Tern Ashandrik. He was initially afraid of Tern and refused to help a group of bounty hunters who were searching for him, but later relented and gave them a lead to Tern for 1,000 credits. He used this money to flee Seregar.",
