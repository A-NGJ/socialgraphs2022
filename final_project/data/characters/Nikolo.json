 "content": "Nikolo was a male Rodian, who lived during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nIn c. 31 BBY, Nikolo accompanied a number of tourists that were visiting the droid production plants on the moon Uffel, in the Cularin system. During the trip, Nikolo and some of the other tourists, the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera and Philinda, and the Sullustan Tret, were recruited by the droid LN-73 into assisting him at sabotaging the production facilities. LN-73 did this by lying to them by claiming that HG-211, Uffel's head of security, had been corrupted. Nikolo and the rest of the group then attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who LN-73 falsely claimed were sabotaging the droid factories. During the resulting firefight, Nikolo failed to set his blaster to stun, like the rest of his group had.",
