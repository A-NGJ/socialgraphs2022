 "content": "Glomkettle Hierogryph was a female Snivvian native of the planet Cadomai Prime and the mother of famed con artist Marn Hierogryph and another son who went on to become an actor. Married to Garl Hierogryph, Glomkettle often had trouble telling her two sons apart. After Marn was involved in a number of incidents in his youth—the last straw being the racketeering conviction of his tutor on evidence planted by Marn—Glomkettle and Garl Hierogryph sent their son away from Cadomai. In 3964 BBY, when Marn was involved in simulating a fake Republic attack on the Mandalorian-held Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, the con artist called his imagined capital ship the Glomkettle.\nLater, Zayne Carrick used \"Glomkettle\" as an alias when he impersonated a Mandalorian commander on Dantooine to rescue a group of Jedi younglings from the leader of the Mandalorian Knights, Dorjander Kace.\nGlomkettle Hierogryph was first mentioned in Knights of the Old Republic 10, a comic written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2006. More information on Hierogryph was given in Miller's short story Labor Pains, as well as the reference books Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook and Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide.",
