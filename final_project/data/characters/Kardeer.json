 "content": "Kardeer was a male Rodian gardener for Lady Valarian on Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKardeer appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Kardeer would have been on Tatooine. However, Kardeer is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game, albeit without any clothing.",
