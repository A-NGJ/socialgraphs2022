 "content": "Doctor Toval Seyah was a Human male scientist and part-time Galactic Alliance spy following the resolution of the Swarm War.\nSeyah maintained an active and trained interest in the Corellian landmark and superweapon, Centerpoint Station, and served the Alliance—and his own interests—at the beginning of the Second Galactic Civil War.\nIn 40 ABY, Alliance Intelligence and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker convinced Seyah to assist Jacen Solo and Ben Skywalker in their mission to destroy or disable Centerpoint Station. Seyah used his extensive knowledge of the station's layout and workings to put the Jedi pair through several simulated scenarios, and provided the two with a datachip that he thought could cause the ancient station to tear itself apart.\nIn the midst of the Alliance's Operation Roundabout, Seyah quietly hoped that the Jedi would not have to destroy the station, due to its mysterious construction, vibrant community, and science.\nHe later led a Jedi team with Kyp Durron to destroy Centerpoint, and they were successful.",
