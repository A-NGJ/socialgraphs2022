 "content": "Admiral Uther Kermen was placed in charge of the Imperial fleet following the Battle of Endor by the Imperial Advisors. Officially he followed the orders of the Imperial Advisors; however, in actuality Kermen decided much of what the fleet did.\nKermen commanded the defense of Milagro in 5 ABY, fighting the New Republic in a months-long siege. Eventually, Kermen destroyed much of the planet with a Base Delta Zero bombardment to deny its resources to the New Republic before being forced to abandon the system.\nEventually he butted heads with Moff Utoxx Prentioch and the New Republic when trying to secure the world Kaal and its food resources. While he played along with the diplomats he never intended for anyone but the Empire to gain control of the world. Kermen eventually betrayed his rival diplomats and was forced to battle it out with Prentioch's flagship. The battle resulted in a stalemate, with Prentioch's flagship and Kermen's own Belligerent taking too much damage to continue to fight. The New Republic ended up securing the world.",
