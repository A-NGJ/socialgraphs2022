 "content": "Arrad was a Human male miner who is the son of Rikkard and lived on the planet Lanteeb during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Around 21 BBY, Arrad was present in Torbel when the Separatists, under the command of General Lok Durd, invaded the planet with its new constructed bio-weapon. Along with his father, they welcomed two Jedi, known as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker who were here to ally the villagers and obtain the consent of the village's storm shields. However, when one the shields failed, Arrad was injured by one of the gases that spread under the shield but later Obi-Wan saved him with the Force.",
