 "content": "Kosaa was a female Tarasin, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nKosaa served the Wyrd, a group of Tarasin Force witches, as a soldier. She was the personal bodyguard of the Wyrd sister Naelora.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Kosaa was present on Cularin in the central hut of the village where the Zhadorii irstat lived, when she and Naelora were attacked by the heroes of Cularin.\nIn Hunting the Wyrd the identity of the Wyrd sister and bodyguard that the player characters fight in the central hut varies, depending on player level. Mid-level players fight Naelora and Kosaa, but Higher-Level players fight Torunin and Savina instead, while Upper-Level players face Baeshana and Veshin. It is also possible for the players to avoid the hut, so even Higher-Level players don't have to fight Naelora and Kosaa.",
