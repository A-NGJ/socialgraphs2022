 "content": "Maliss was a Dashade pirate who worked with Sorath. The two Dashades were hired as part of Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit's scheme to steal components before they could be delivered to Project Stardust. Maliss and Sorath, along with their crew, were based in a mobile way station that jumped to star systems where commandeered starships were taken before they could leave the Kurost transfer point, and the pirates would collect the cargo. However, the station was attacked by the Grysks, who killed Maliss.",
