 "content": "Darex Rath was a Human male who lived during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, Rath was present on an Imperial space station in the Outer Rim Territories when an Imperial-class Star Destroyer captured a passenger freighter on suspicion of harboring criminals. Several spacers were apprehended and taken to the Imperial space station. The spacers were finally released but the space station was later attacked by pirates. Darex Rath helped a spacer to escape the station and recommended him to go to Tatooine and seek assistance from Trehla Keelo Mos Eisley.\nDarex Rath was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Darex Rath was added to the game when the developers revamped the \"New Player Tutorial\", with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. However, Darex Rath was removed alongside with this tutorial when the developers introduced a completely new tutorial with the release of the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
