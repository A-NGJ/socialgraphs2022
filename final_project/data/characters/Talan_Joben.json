 "content": "Talan Joben was a male Corellian businessman who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Joben was the owner of the Joben Crate Company, a crate manufacturing company based near Coronet. In 1 ABY, his company was attacked by the retired adventurer Riyan Kiner. The insane crate-hating man also planted bombs in Joben-brand crates that were placed near hotels on several worlds in the galaxy. A spacer investigating the attack of the Joben Crate Company for Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr finally discovered the plot. The spacer then managed to disable the bombs before they could hurt anybody.\nTalan Joben appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Talan Joben was added to the game with the update dubbed \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King,\" released on June 19, 2008.",
