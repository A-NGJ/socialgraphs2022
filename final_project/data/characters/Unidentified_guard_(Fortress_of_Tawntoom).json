 "content": "A Human male worked as a guard on the planet Roon. In 15 BBY, he was distracted by the Human Mungo Baobab's mupple pie and mistakenly allowed prisoners to escape from the fortress that he had been tasked with guarding.\nA Human male security guard worked for Governor Bisad Koong of the planet Roon. In 15 BBY, the guard was tasked with guarding Koong's Fortress of Tawntoom on Roon when the Human Mungo Baobab and his droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, tried to sneak in in order to free friends of theirs. With the infiltrators disguised as merchants, the guard inquired of Baobab and C-3PO's business; Baobab tried to distract them with mupple pies that he had stolen and was able to do so once he offered the pies at no cost. The guard, along with another Human guard, ate and enjoyed the pies, allowing C-3PO to smuggle in R2-D2.\nThe distraction did not hold for long, however, for once the pair of guards were finished with their mupple pie, they immediately clamored for more. It was then that R2-D2 was able to evacuate his targets, Auren and Nilz Yomm, so C-3PO pointed to the escaped prisoners for the guards to chase after; Baobab then intervened and knocked the guards down.\nThe guard was easily distracted by the prospect of free pie. He had brown hair, green eyes, and light skin.\nLike his partner, the security guard wore a green uniform with brown cuffs, brown boots, and a brown cap with a spot of yellow on it. He also carried a staff-like weapon.\nThe guard appeared in \"The Frozen Citadel,\" the thirteenth and final episode of the Star Wars: Droids animated series, which aired on November 30, 1985.",
