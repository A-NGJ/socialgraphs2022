 "content": "Lora Nadad was a female Human Padawan in service to the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the decades leading up to the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Human born to a family on Forard, Lora Nadad was orphaned at a young age and eventually became the de facto leader among those orphans of \"The Lost\" living in the city. At the age of nineteen, Nadad was identified as Forceful and inducted into the Jedi Order to be trained in the ways of the Force at the experimental Academy on Almas, far from the eyes of the Jedi High Council on Coruscant.\nWhile there, Nadad befriended fellow apprentice Alurali, and the two worked together to promote the welfare of The Lost. During the Clone Wars, Nadad invoked the Right of Denial and refused to report to Coruscant to receive military ranking within the Grand Army of the Republic. Near the end of the war, a Dark Jedi named Garth Ezzar attacked and destroyed the academy in a stunning assault upon Almas. Surviving the attack, Nadad fled to a warehouse on Cularin where she was able to avoid detection as the Great Jedi Purge was initiated at the end of the war by the Galactic Empire.",
