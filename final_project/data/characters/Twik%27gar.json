 "content": "Twik'gar was a Gran thug on Nar Shaddaa who wanted Meetra Surik to fetch Geredi, who borrowed large sum of credits from Twik'gar from the Pazaak Den, but never did the job. He was likely working for The Exchange and accompanied by two Trandoshan mercenaries.\nIf the player follows dark side story in the game, the player would tell Geredi that either a young female Twi'Lek or his friends were waiting for him outside the Den. After that, Twik'gar and his Trandoshan thugs likely killed Geredi and disappeared.",
