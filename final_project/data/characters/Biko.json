 "content": "Biko was a male Rodian who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nBiko lived on the planet of Cularin and by the time he was fourteen, he had became a member of a small gang consisting of himself, Naja Delan, Oora Gellandi and Meera Lisso. The gang was present in the platform city of Bayonard when they overhead members of a Thaereian military hit squad discussing their plans to assassinate the diplomat Gavid Lermyn. Biko and his friends did not realize the significance of the information they had heard, but shortly afterwards assisted the Heroes of Cularin in thwarting the plot to kill Lermyn.",
