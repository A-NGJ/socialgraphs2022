 "content": "Taleah Novran was a female Tarasin Force Adept, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 31 BBY, Novran attended the SoroSuub Anniversary celebration that was held in the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Cularin. During the event, she tried to pair promising young Force Adepts with more experienced mentors, and three other Force Adepts: Otee Nom, Dole Happ and Rilly Raadun assisted her in this task.\nNovran was strong-willed and was determined to succeed at her daunting task of finding and pairing up Force Adepts. She believed that all questions could be answered by the Force and thought that most force-sensitives were better suited by the minimum guidance approach of the Force Adepts than by the more rigid structures of the Jedi. Rather than lecture her students, she would teach them through riddles and questions, hoping that this would lead them to discover their own paths to the Force.",
