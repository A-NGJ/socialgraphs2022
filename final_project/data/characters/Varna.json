 "content": "\"Varna\" was a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic that held the military rank of Clone Commander during the Clone Wars under the command of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. Varna was killed while evacuating from the siege of Devalok aboard a Low Altitude Assault Transport.\nVarna was a clone of the human male Jango Fett and was born on the world of Kamino. During the galactic-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems known as the Clone Wars Varna was deployed to Devalok when the Republic evacuated the last personnel there. During the fighting, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker were separated from the rest of the force. Kenobi contacted Varna and asked for a Low Altitude Assault Transport. Later, Varna brought the gunship to them, and they took on surviving civilians. As it lifted away, they came under heavy fire from Separatist droids, and Varna was shot away.\nAs with the other clones of Jango Fett, Sterling stood 1.83 meters tall. He obediently obeyed Kenobi's command to bring them a gunship.\nVarna appeared in the story \"The Eye of the Beholder\" by Sarwat Chadda and included in the 2022 anthology Stories of Jedi and Sith.",
