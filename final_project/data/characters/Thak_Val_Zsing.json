 "content": "Thak Val Zsing was a red-bearded Human male from Ord Cestus. His great-grandfather had been a murderer sent to that world. He was originally a history professor until he lost his job in a government cut of social programs. He was then forced to become a miner. Around 51 BBY, he took command of the terrorist group called Desert Wind. He enjoyed drinking Chandrilan brandy.\nHe remained a leader of Desert Wind up through the Battle of Ord Cestus around 22 BBY. During the final days of that conflict, he suicide-bombed a JK-13 combat droid using a mine, crippling it. This sacrifice allowed CT-96/298 to destroy the Five Families headquarters. At the time of his death he had at least two grandchildren.",
