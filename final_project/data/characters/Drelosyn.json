 "content": "Drelosyn was a Human male who served as a Scout trooper Corporal in the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps.\nBorn on Coruscant, Drelosyn raced swoops in the underworld of Imperial City, honing his piloting skills. Prior to 4 ABY, he joined the Empire's Stormtrooper Corps and rose to the rank of Corporal, eventually being assigned to Endor, the construction site of the Death Star II. He was partnered with scout trooper Corporal Misik and tasked with patrolling the moon on speeder bikes for threats to the Death Star's shield generator bunker. While on Endor, he continued developing his piloting skills.\nIn 4 ABY, a Rebel strike team landed on the moon and were spotted by scout trooper Sergeant Barich and his partner, who rode off on their speeder bikes to get help. Rebels Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa chased after them on their own bike. After Skywalker took out Barich's partner and acquired his bike for himself, Barich rode past Drelosyn and Misik, who followed behind the Rebels and shot at them. Skywalker broke off from Organa to deal with the two other troopers, breaking and ending up behind them. He used his bike to shoot Drelosyn, whose bike crashed into a tree and exploded, killing him.\nDrelosyn wore the standard armor and helmet given to scout troopers. He rode a 74-Z speeder bike.",
