 "content": "Forzaa was a Zeltron female who worked as a fortune teller in the lower levels of Coruscant. When searching for a lost museum on Level 4, Amilyn Holdo visited Forzaa with Leia Organa, and the fortune teller guided them in the right direction. She seemed to have force-like abilities, such as knowing things about people without speaking to them. She was also in possession of what she called the \"Liga crystal,\" an object which assisted greatly in Leia and Holdo's expedition.\nForzaa first appeared in \"The Right Wrong Turn,\" written by Delilah S. Dawson, illustrated by Margaux Saltel, and published in Star Wars Adventures  25 on September 11, 2019. Forzaa's name was not used in the comic, but was written in Aurebesh on a sign.",
