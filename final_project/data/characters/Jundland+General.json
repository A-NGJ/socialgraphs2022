 "content": "\"Jundland General\" also known as \"Tusken Chieftain\" was a male Tusken Raider that lived on Tatooine. He built strategic bases for his Tusken brethren, and led various strategic attacks on settlements throughout his home planet. Eventually, he was brought down by the gang led by Saponza and his partner. He wielded a modified slugthrower cycler rifle that could pierce through the armor of military turrets.",
