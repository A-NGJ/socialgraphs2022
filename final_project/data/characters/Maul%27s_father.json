 "content": "Maul's father was a Dathomirian Zabrak male who sired the infamous Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Maul.\nSelected by Kycina to become her mate, this Zabrak and the Human Nightsister conceived a child in 54 BBY. Their son was born on the planet Iridonia and was given the name Maulâ€”the same Maul who would later be feared and dreaded as Darth Maul, Dark Lord of the Sith as the Sith apprentice to Darth Sidious.\nAs per Dathomirian tradition, the father of Maul was killed, possibly by Kycina herself, shortly after the infant's birth.",
