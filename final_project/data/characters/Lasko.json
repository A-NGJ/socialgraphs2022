 "content": "Lasko was a Human male settler who lived on Sulon during the Galactic Civil War. His wife was killed during the Imperial raid on Sulon in 1 BBY, and he afterward moved to Ruusan, near Fort Nowhere. As of 5 ABY he had a new wife and six-month-old child. He was nearly Force-choked to death by Dark Jedi Sariss, who wanted to intimidate the other citizens of the settlement. After the Dark Jedi left, Lasko rounded up his family and left Fort Nowhere, shortly before it was destroyed.\nIn the audio adaptation of Dark Forces: Jedi Knight, this character was voiced by Louise Enyeart.",
