 "content": "\"Old Hardshell\" was the nickname of an acklay owned by the Hutt crime lord Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi who fought in gladiatorial matches at the Grakkus Arena on Nar Shaddaa, which left the acklay battle-scarred. A preliminary advertisement for Vontor's Eve engagements presented to Grakkus by Toren included a match featuring Old Hardshell, which called for attendees to place bets on the match. A copy of this poster was placed within the pages of the Smuggler's Guide while the book was in Toren's possession.\nOld Hardshell was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide by Daniel Wallace.",
