 "content": "Anton Kale was a Captain in the Imperial Army, who volunteered to command the forces of the Galactic Empire on Kuat.\nIn his early years, Kale witnessed the corruption and greed in the Galactic Senate. This led him to become a firm supporter of both Palpatine's New Order and the use of force to expand the Empire. Unlike many of his peers, Kale believed in the existence of the Force and respected any being who could use it. These unconventional beliefs, as well as unusual strategies, ensured that Kale was a worthy adversary for the Rebel Alliance.",
