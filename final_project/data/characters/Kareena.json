 "content": "Kareena was a female human bartender and formerly sole owner of the Blaster's Path cantina in Rishi's town of Raider's Cove. After the Nova Blades pirates claimed a stake in the cantina's ownership, Kareena tried to get it back to no avail. She was present when Gorro was killed after challenging an off-worlder to a fight, incorrectly believing them to be a pirate gang leader.\nKareena was a human female with brown eyes, dark skin, and black hair styled in spikes and tied back by a headband. At the time of Gorro's death in the Blaster's Path cantina, Kareena wore a sleeveless yellow shirt with an open green vest and pale green pants.\nKareena displayed a calm and assertive attitude, despite attempted threats towards her by unsavory patrons of her cantina.\nKareena appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan, a 2014 expansion to the 2011 massively-multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.\nFemale player characters aligned with the Sith Empire have the option of flirting with Kareena, asking her if she is doing anything later. Kareena states the player is \"sweet for asking,\" but turns down the offer as she is busy managing the cantina.",
