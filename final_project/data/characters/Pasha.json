 "content": "Pasha was a Human Padawan who went to Jedi Academy. His home world was Obroa-Skai. His father worked at the Obroan Institute for Archaeology. Pasha was a skilled lightsaber duelist. He had a girlfriend at Jedi Academy called Shi-Fara. Pasha was one of the first students befriended by Roan Novachez and currently his best friend at Jedi Academy.\nPasha excelled at lightsaber combat and during Pasha's second year of attendance, he won a Lightsaber Fencing Tournament, beating Roan whom he had drifted apart from him due to Roan's liking towards Cronah and Cyrus. He was also close to defeating Cyrus in another lightsaber battle. He eventually became friends with Roan again after Roan apologized.\nIn his third year, Pasha trained personally with a Jedi Master, but failed to find his focus. He joined Roan in the Obstacle Course, being on his team for the event. He also bypassed the labyrinth that was the final test, arriving at the finish a little while before Roan.\nPasha grew up and became a Jedi Knight. In 162 BBY, he visited the Academy.\nPasha was born on Obroa-Skai. His father worked at the Obroan Institute for Archaeology.\nPasha was a skilled lightsaber duelist.
