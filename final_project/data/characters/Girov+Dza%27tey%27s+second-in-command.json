 "content": "Girov Dza'tey's second-in-command was a Bothan who served as chief lieutenant to Girov Dza'tey on an expedition to Malrev IV. When Dza'tey seized control of the Sith Temple there, the second-in-command distrusted Dza'tey's motives and concern for the crew of the Starfaring, on which they had arrived, and threw his support behind Rogue Squadron, which defeated Dza'tey.",
