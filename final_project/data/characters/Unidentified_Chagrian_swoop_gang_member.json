 "content": "A Chagrian male was a member of a swoop gang during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the gang traveled to a cantina on the planet Arkanis after they received an invitation from the resurgent criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn. When they arrived at the cantina, the Chagrian was informed by a human female member of the gang that the invitation meant they would be able to collect the carbonite-frozen body of the smuggler Han Solo, before she questioned if they could trust Crimson Dawn. Shortly after, the Sith assassin Ochi, who worked for the Sith Lord Darth Vader, made his way into the bar by kicking through the door and causing the Chagrian to spill his drink. The Chagrian responded by punching the assassin in the face and pulling out a vibro-knife, and threatened to kill Ochi. With this, Ochi revealed his alliegance to Vader, though the Chagrian did not understand and questioned who Vader was. In response, the Sith assassin headbutted the Chagrian, which caused him to bleed from his forehead.",
