 "content": "Arkan, also known by the nickname Arkan the Shark, was a Human male who was the owner and \"Supreme Executive Officer\" of the Lucky Runner casino on the moon Nar Shaddaa during the Galactic War. Arkan hired a number of \"debt facilitators\" who were in fact street gangsters likened to himself. However, the Lucky Runner's business clashing with the Haven's Blaze casino prompted the latter's owner, Otheros, to put a bounty on Arkan and his gangsters.\nArkan first appeared in Game Update 2.3 of the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, released by BioWare in 2013. He is only accessible through the Bounty Contract Week event as the Nar Shaddaa Kingpin Bounty.",
