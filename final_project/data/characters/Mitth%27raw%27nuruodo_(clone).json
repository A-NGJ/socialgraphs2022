 "content": "Before his campaign against the New Republic, Chiss Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who was also known by his core name \"Thrawn,\" sent a single spaarti cloning cylinder to the Hand of Thrawn fortress on the Wild Space planet Nirauan, where he stored a clone of himself. Before leaving the complex, the admiral informed his forces in the Unknown Regions, the Empire of the Hand, that if he was ever reported dead, he would return in ten years.\nTen years after the Grand Admiral had died during the Battle of Bilbringi, former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade Skywalker and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker infiltrated the chamber of the Hand of Thrawn where Thrawn's clone was. There, the pair was forced to destroy a wall to defeat the clone's droid protectors, which killed Thrawn's duplicate.\nBefore leaving the Hand of Thrawn fortress located on the Wild Space planet Nirauan, Chiss Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo—commonly known by his core name \"Thrawn\"—told his Empire of the Hand forces that if he was ever reported dead, they should wait ten years for his return. To accomplish that, Thrawn sent a single spaarti cloning cylinder to a Hand of Thrawn facility beneath a lake and set it to activate in a decade. In 9 ABY, during his military campaign that nearly crippled the New Republic known as the Thrawn campaign against the New Republic, his Noghri bodyguard Rukh—who had discovered that the Grand Admiral had poisoned the Noghri homeworld's ecosystem—assassinated him.\nTen years later, in 19 ABY, the clone was nearly complete, and rumors of Thrawn's return—spread by the con man Flim posing as Thrawn for the Imperial Remnant—eventually reached Empire of the Hand Admiral Voss Parck. He informed Emperor's Hand Mara Jade, who had infiltrated the Empire of the Hand fortress, of Thrawn's promised return before Jade escaped the complex and entered the facility containing Thrawn's clone with Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Inside the cloning chamber, sentry droids attacked the pair, who were unable to destroy the sentries covered with cortosis, a metal that shut down lightsabers. The pair decided not to murder Thrawn's clone, however, Skywalker was forced to destroy a wall preventing the lake's water from entering the structure to destroy the droids, which killed Thrawn's clone.\nAs a clone of Grand Admiral Thrawn, he was a male Chiss who stood at 1.8 meters. The Grand Admiral's clone had blue-black hair, red eyes, and blue skin.\nThrawn's clone first appeared in the 1997 novel Vision of the Future, the final installment in Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn Duology.",
