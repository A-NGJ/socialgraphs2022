 "content": "Fal Tivvik was a female Intendant of the Yuuzhan Vong, and one-time advisor to High Prefect Yoog Skell. Following complications during her Escalation process, however, she became a Shamed One.\nFal Tivvik was a member of the Intendant caste, those Yuuzhan Vong who oversaw the administration and the bureaucracy of the species. When she was still young, Tivvik became an adviser to a superior intendant, High Prefect Yoog Skell, and proved herself in his service as one of his most talented protégés, to the extent that she was marked for Escalation. During the escalation ceremony, however, the shaper in charge of the process, Ch'Gang Hool—later responsible during the Yuuzhan Vong War for the terraforming of Coruscant—was suspected by High Prefect Skell of having made errors in the Escalation process. Tivvik's implants were rejected and she became Shamed, and Yoog Skell's suspicions of Master Shaper Ch'Gang Hool's talents never truly abated.",
