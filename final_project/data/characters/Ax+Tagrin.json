 "content": "Ax Tagrin was a male Iktotchi bounty hunter active during the First Order-Resistance War. During the war, Tagrin was hired by the First Order to hunt and capture members of the Resistance.\nDuring the war between the Resistance and the First Order, Iktotchi bounty hunter Ax Tagrin found himself hunting down Resistance spy Norath Kev and his droid 2BR-NTB. After a pursuit in Vargo Spaceport on Varkana, the spy got caught and 2BR-NTB was destroyed. Later in the same spaceport, Tagrin caught members of Team Colossus fellow Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, Jarek Yeager, and Xiono's CB-23 by trapping them in his ship, the Dalkor Dagger.\nDue to CB-23 sabotaging one of the ship's engines, the Dalkor Dagger crashed back onto Varkana before Tagrin could turn his prisoners over to the First Order. As the Resistance members attempted to make their escape, Kev and Xiono fled on a speeder bike while Synara San, Yeager, and CB-23 were captured by Tagrin. Tagrin brought them to Commander Pyre, but because two agents were still at large, he didn't receive his bounty.\nTagrin was persistent to catch the spies until he discovered Kev and Xiono disguised as stormtroopers and overheard Xiono mention his shuttle parked outside the spaceport. After finding Xiono's shuttle, Tagrin broke in and used signal-tracing to locate the Colossus, which was hiding in a nearby gas giant, for the First Order. In the meantime, Xiono and Kev helped Yeager and San escape and ran back to their shuttle, where Tagrin was hiding in the back. While Xiono and Kev were starting the shuttle, Tagrin revealed himself and ambushed them. He almost captured Xiono and Kev, but with the help of CB-23, they managed to take out Tagrin and retreat from Varkana.\nAx Tagrin wore custom armor, with a removable faceplate. He also had a ship named the Dalkor Dagger. It was heavily fortified and had an impressive arsenal of weaponry. It was vulnerable from within the inside, as it has been crashed by CB-23. Tagrin used a vibro-ax with an extendable arm.\nAx Tagrin first appeared in \"The Missing Agent\", an episode of second season of Star Wars Resistance where he was voiced by Joe Manganiello. His name is a pun on the phrase \"axe to grind\".",
