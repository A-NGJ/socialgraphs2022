 "content": "A red-skinned Twi'lek male was briefly interrogated by the Imperial Alecia Beck while she searched for Han Solo and his partner Chewbacca on the planet Cyrkon. He was taken from a bar where he was sitting with several other people, all of which didn't know who Solo was, and referred to him as \"him\" or \"he\". The Twi'lek insisted that he didn't know where the man was. However, after being asked by Beck if he believed the man was a rebel, and he said yes, Beck executed him and told a stormtrooper sergeant to clean up the body.",
