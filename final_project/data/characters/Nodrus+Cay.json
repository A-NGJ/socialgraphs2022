 "content": "Nodrus Cay was a Zabrak female who was a ranking lieutenant in the Black Sun criminal syndicate. In 49 BBY, the Jedi Initiate Gehren Rand made a deal with Cay to get off Coruscant to help her father, who she had seen was in danger, in exchange for Eadun silver. When Rand's friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, arrived and used the Force during a fight with Cay's underlings. Rand also used the Force to attack one of the thugs who had kicked her friend. Cay stopped the fight and brought the two to a ship. With the discovery that Rand and his friend were Jedi, Cay had decided that she wanted to take them into her service instead of just simply taking the silver, but the pair managed to escape.",
