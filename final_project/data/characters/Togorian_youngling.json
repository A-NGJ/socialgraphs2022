 "content": "This unidentified youngling was a Togorian Jedi youngling who escaped Order 66 with K'Kruhk and Chase Piru.\nThis Togorian was a member of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan. The clan was stationed at the Jedi chapter house on Bogden 3. They were awaiting transport back to the Coruscant Jedi Temple, which had been delayed due to the battle there. When Masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel arrived with their clone troopers, Order 66 was issued. Several of the younglings were killed as Du Mahn defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, the young Jedi was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\nThe youngling was present when Lumbra and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, Seddwia, jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the Empire.\nThe younglings were freed by K'Kruhk who gave in to un-jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru, he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber.\nThis youngling and the rest of the Jedi crash-landed on the planet Arkinnea and were taken into custody by the Arkinnea Militia. They were placed into a refugee camp with the rest of their group. The youngling listened to a fellow refugee as she explained the workings of the camp to Piru. The youngling was present when Master Zao found them in the refugee camp. After dinner, they sat down with the rest of the younglings as Zao taught them their daily lesson.\nThe Togarorian, along with the rest of the younglings and Jedi, escaped the refugee camp under the cover of darkness and made their way out into the Arkinnean countryside. The younglings scavenged fields, picking Beelpop melons and other vegetables. The youngling expressed his dislike of the melons, saying he didn't want to eat them. They continued their trip, and the youngling took a nap in the back of the repulsorcart with the rest of the clan. They reached a hill, and the Togorian joined in with the rest of the younglings as they raced Piru to the top. When they reached the top, they discovered an open mass grave where the Arkinnea Militia had been dropping refugees to their deaths. They then watched in horror as an ore carrier flew over the valley and dropped another load of refugees to their deaths. When K'Kruhk realized the group had been spotted, he used the Force to move the others into the back of the cart. The vehicle reached the bottom of the hill and hit a tree, throwing everyone out of it.\nAfter recovering from the crash, the Togorian and the rest of the younglings followed Zao deeper into the forest. The youngling hid with the group when they heard blaster fire and was present when the Yunu found the group of Jedi. The Arkinnea Militia caught up with the two groups and held them at gunpoint. As the militia opened fire, Zao used to force to raise a boulder out of the ground to give them cover. The Togorian fled with Piru and the other younglings but returned to help defend Zao. After the battle, the youngling and the rest of the clan followed the Yunu deeper into the forest. The youngling greeted K'Kruhk when he caught up with the rest of the group. The Togorian youngling settled into their new home and continued their training as a Jedi.",
