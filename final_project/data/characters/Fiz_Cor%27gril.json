 "content": "Fiz Cor'gril, better known as Fizzi, was a male Bith who lived on Trevi IV where he ran a used-ship warehouse known as Fizzi's Slightly Used Starships.\nCor'gril had trouble succeeding on his homeworld of Clak'dor VII so he left to try to find his way in the galaxy. He had many jobs, many that were dubiously legal, and gained knowledge of business and starships. After accumulating a large amount of credits, he decided to settle down and start his own business. Cor'gril travelled to Trevi IV and bought a large starship garage that was going out of business due to competition from newer docking bays in the Trevi City Spaceport. Using his contacts from his travels, he obtained several ships and opened his business. He was well regarded by smugglers and free traders who appreciated the ships and services he provided.\nIn his possession was the sabotaged yacht Firerider, bought from its previous owner Serdo.\nCor'gril was intelligent and polite. He didn't pressure his clients like most salesbeings, instead preferring to talk politely. He had a tendency to be verbose. He would downplay any deficiencies with his products while trying to find the best ship for his client. The Bith would fill his contracts with fine print that would relieve him of any responsibility of any violations of Imperial regulations.",
