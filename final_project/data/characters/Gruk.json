 "content": "Gruk was a male pirate of a humanoid species who operated in the Lost Clusters. He traded in slavery, selling people to work camps. Gruk utilized a former Confederacy of Independent Systems Munificent-class star frigate that he had found as a derelict from the Clone Wars and redecorated. When the pirate crew of Sidon Ithano wished to utilize the Munificent-class star frigate to track down other derelict Separatist vessels, his first mate, Quiggold, allowed himself to be captured by Gruk's people and taken aboard his ship. The mechanic Reveth and former clone trooper Kix followed a beacon Quiggold had on him to the frigate, hijacking it and fighting through Gruk's crew. With Gruk left cornered aboard his vessel's bridge, Quiggold revealed why Ithano's crew wanted the frigate. Quiggold then confronted Gruk about his acts of selling people to labor camps before shooting the pirate. Ithano's crew subsequently took control of Gruk's starship.",
