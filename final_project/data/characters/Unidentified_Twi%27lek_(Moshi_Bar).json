 "content": "The unidentified female Twi'lek worked as an exotic dancer during the Clone Wars at Moshi Bar on Coruscant. When Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon visited the bar during their investigation into the whereabouts of a young Boba Fett, the unidentified Twi'lek's performance was being watched by a male Rodian and a male Quarren who were arguing with each other over which one of them the Twi'lek would prefer. When Ahsoka was caught eavesdropping, the Twi'lek—along with the other bar patrons—drew a small and surprisingly well hidden blaster. However, Ahsoka's quick thinking allowed the Jedi Padawan and Plo Koon to safely leave the establishment.",
