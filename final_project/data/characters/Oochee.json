 "content": "Oochee was an Ewok from the forest moon of Endor. He lived in Bright Tree Village and fought with spears against the Empire.\nOochee is an action figure in a Hasbro battle pack released in 2007. The action figure is composed of a repainted Logray body and a Wicket W. Warrick hood from a 1997 Hasbro two-pack. Previously, the name was used in a role-playing game supplement.\nThe battle pack also includes an Ewok named Wicket W. Warrick, although the coloring resembles that of Widdle Warrick, his brother. Together, the dark-furred Oochee and the light-furred Wicket W. Warrick resemble the Ewoks who help Chewbacca commandeer an Imperial AT-ST walker in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. However, a later Hasbro release has instead identified that dark-furred Ewok as Wunka.",
