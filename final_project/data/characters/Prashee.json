 "content": "Prashee and Cratinus were identical Ubdurian brothers who use their identical appearances to swap identities during profitable scams. Approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor, both brothers were present in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana. As the pair laughed together at a table, the smuggler Han Solo entered with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the Astromech droid BB-8. Not long after the four newcomers arrived, many of the patrons in the castle rushed outside to witness the First Order destroying the Hosnian system with their Starkiller Base superweapon. Kanata's castle was then attacked and destroyed by the forces of the First Order. Both Prashee and his brother were gamblers fond of games of chance. Prashee wore a metal cap and an Ubdurian traveling smock which matched his brothers.\nPrashee first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. He was not identified in the film, but was named by Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. Prashee is performed by actor and creature performer Tom Bell.",
