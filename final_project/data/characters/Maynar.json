 "content": "Maynar was a young female Lurmen who lived on the planet Qalydon during the Imperial Era. Daughter of Elan and her village's chief, Biz, she helped the Freemakers in protecting their home from the Galactic Empire. While initially skeptical of the Force and not appreciating the importance of her people's kyber crystals, Maynar gained a better understanding of the Force after witnessing Rowan Freemaker use it against M-OC and to recover her people's crystals from the Imperial officers Durpin and Plumestriker.\nMaynar was the daughter of the Lurmen chief Biz and his wife Elan. She and her family lived in a Lurman village on the planet Qalydon during the Imperial Era. During the Freemakers' Mission to Qalydon, she spotted their ship StarScavenger approach her village. The adult villagers were initially hostile to the offworlders when they learned that they were searching for kyber crystals, believing them to be in the Galactic Empire's service. However, Kordi Freemaker managed to convince them they were not Imperials.\nWhile the adults were socializing with Kordi and Zander Freemaker, Maynar socialized with their younger brother Rowan Freemaker. Aware that Rowan was looking for a kyber crystal, Maynar tried to offer Rowan her family's crystal but he told her to keep it. Maynar believed that the crystals did not do much and were a myth. When Rowan explained that the crystals amplified their connection to the Force, she dismissed it as a myth as well. Rowan disagreed but Maynar expressed dissatisfaction that she had to stay behind on Qalydon with her dad and their kaadu.\nShortly later, Imperial forces under the Imperial officers Durpin and Plumestriker raided her village, seeking kyber crystals for the Empire's second Death Star. The Imperials also captured Kordi, Zander, and Roger. However, Rowan and Maynar managed to sneak back aboard the StarScavenger and used its laser cannons to drive the Imperials away. The Imperials fled aboard a Gozanti-class cruiser but Rowan managed to damage its rear stabilizer and hyperdrive, causing it to crash in a nearby mountain.\nWithout informing her family or the Freemakers, Maynar followed the Freemakers on their mission to recover the kyber crystal necklaces from the Imperials, stowing aboard their tug. She followed Rowan into the Gozanti-class cruiser and found him after he had encountered the crystals. Rowan was initially upset that Maynar had exposed herself to danger by following them. Despite her skepticism of the Force, Maynar was fascinated with his lightsaber.\nAfter leaving the Gozanti-class cruiser, Rowan was attacked by the Imperial hunter droid M-OC. While the two engaged in a lightsaber duel, Rowan tried to tell Maynar to get away. However, M-OC captured Maynar, exploiting is compassion for her. Zander managed to free Maynar from M-OC's clutches by ramming his tug into the hunter droid. Maynar managed to flee with the recovered kyber crystal necklaces but was spotted by Durpin and Plumestriker who gave chase.\nMaynar found her path blocked by boulders and was cornered by the two Imperials. Durpin ordered her to hand over the crystals but the two Imperials were tackled to the ground by Kordi and Zander. This bought Maynar enough time to climb the boulders and escape. She soon encountered Rowan, who had managed to temporarily defeat M-OC by using the Force to entomb him with debris and machinery. However, they were ambushed by Durpin and Plumestriker, who stole the crystals and fled into hyperspace on their repaired Gozanti-class cruiser.\nUsing the Force, Rowan was able to track the Imperial cruiser down to the Marriten system. There, Rowan and his siblings recovered the crystals. They then returned Maynar and the crystal necklaces to her people. Returning home, Maynar was hugged by her father Biz. Maynar told her father not to worry because the crystals were back. Biz responded that she was more important than the crystals. Biz offered the Freemakers the villagers' crystals but Rowan declined since he did not want to deprive the villagers of their kyber crystals. Having seen the Force in action with Rowan, Maynar wished that the Force would be with Rowan before he left with his siblings.\nAware of Rowan's friendship with Maynar, the Imperial hunter droid M-OC impersonated her. He used a hologram projection of her to lure Rowan into a trap on Qalydon. However, M-OC was ambushed by his rival Darth Vader, the Emperor's second-in-command, who disintegrated him and captured Rowan instead.\nMaynar was a female Lurmen. She did not share her father Biz's reverence for kyber crystals and regarded the Force as a myth. Maynar also regarded life on Qalydon as boring and wanted to travel offworld with her friends. She was also adventurous and placed herself in danger when she accompanied the Freemakers on their quest to recover he people's kyber crystals.\nMaynar's friendship with the Force Builder Rowan led her to reappraise her views of the Force. Having seen Rowan use the Force in combat against the hunter droid M-OC and to track down an Imperial ship that had escaped into space with her people's crystals, she came to appreciate the Force and the kyber crystals' importance to her people.\nMaynar first appeared in the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two episode \"The Lost Crystals of Qalydon,\" which first premiered on Disney XD on August 7, 2017. She is voiced by Coco Grayson.",
