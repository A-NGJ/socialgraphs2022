 "content": "A Bounty Hunters' Guild agent worked on Carajam during the Galactic Civil War, providing information to Guild bounty hunters regarding their bounties and processing monetary transactions between clients and hunters.\nWhen bounty hunter Boba Fett arrived in a cantina with a dead rebel pilot, the Guild agent gave him 50,000 credits for it, suggesting that he take a deal on the Jorgan Spa. But the bounty hunter was looking for a new bounty instead, so she told him to hunt down Zingo Gabnit for a 100,000 credit reward. When Boba Fett returned with the bounty complete, he was rewarded.\nThe Bounty Hunters' Guild agent appears in the 2019 comic issue Age of Rebellion - Boba Fett 1, written by Greg Pak.",
