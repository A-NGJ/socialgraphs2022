 "content": "A male Dulok hunter joined a hunting party to capture wild maramus on the Forest Moon of Endor at the behest of his King, Gorneesh. The Dulok and his fellows were ambushed and forced to flee by an entity known to them as the Red Ghostâ€”in reality, the wild Ewok Asha. The Dulok was distinguished from others of his tribe by a white cloth tied around his left arm and by a tuft of long, green fur on his chest.\nThe Dulok appears in the Ewoks episode Asha as well as its adaptations. Several sources mention the Ewok Asha and the Dulok hunting party she bested.",
