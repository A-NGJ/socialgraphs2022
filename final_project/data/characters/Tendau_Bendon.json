 "content": "Tendau Bendon was a male Ithorian senator who represented Ithor and the Ottega sector in the Galactic Senate of the Republic during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nA male Ithorian, Senator Tendau Bendon represented the Ottega sector in the Senate during Finis Valorum's last term as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Bendon was among the senators who openly supported Valorum, even if most of the Senate would have rather replace the Chancellor.\nIn 33 BBY, Chancellor Valorum proposed the taxation of the until then free trade zones. Senator Palpatine of Naboo then suggested that a part of the collected money could be invested in the growth of planetary systems in the affected areas. Bendon and other senators of the region, including Yarua and Horox Ryyder, cheerfully supported the idea.\nBendon continued his career as senator during the years which followed the Separatist Crisis. Before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Bendon was a staunch opponent of the Military Creation Act. His attempts to oppose it were unsuccessful which led to the start of the Clone Wars.\nIn 19 BBY, the final year of the war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Bendon, along with a number of senators and delegates, grew suspicious over Palpatine's growing powers and demanded his resignation. There, he joined the Delegation of 2000 in order to prevent the Chancellor from continuing these emergency powers since many delegates feared for the future of democracy in the Republic.\nDuring his time on Coruscant, Bendon visited the Coruscant Opera, like many other politicians of the time. Bendon was known to have assisted to a representation of The Brief Reign of Future Wraiths, performed by a Bith company.\nSome reference sources mistakenly identify an Ithorian merchant from Mos Espa as Senator Bendon.",
