 "content": "Pamr was a young Corellian female that was being harassed by Ilir Post and two of his friends, in the aftermath of a Harvest Festival. She was rescued by Soontir Fel, who not only thrashed all three young men, but reported their crime to CorSec.\nRather than let Ilir be prosecuted, the agro-combine his father worked for, Allied Grain and Roughage, coerced Fel to accept a place at the Imperial Academy on Carida and miss Ilir's trial.",
