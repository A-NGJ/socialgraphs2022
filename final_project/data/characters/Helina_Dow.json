 "content": "Helina Dow was a Genian female who served as a Separatist spy hired by Passel Argente during the Clone Wars. She was also Talesan Fry's Executive in charge of production and distribution.\nHelina Dow worked for Talesan Fry at his surveillance production company. Secretly a spy for the Separatists, she was planted in the complex early on in its development. When Talesan created the codebreaker, she made an attempt to steal it from Republic agents Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Siri Tachi and Padm√© Amidala. The attempt was foiled, however, and Helina was subsequently killed by the bounty hunter Magus, due to the fact that having failed to steal the codebreaker she had become a liability.",
