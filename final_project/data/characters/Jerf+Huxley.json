 "content": "Jerf Huxley was a heavyset Human male who worked as a smuggler in the Outer Rim and was once part of Talon Karrde's organization, and did not take kindly to being cut off from it in 22 ABY. Bats, Fisk, and Sinker were some of his enforcers, known as Huxlings, and he had a droideka. He would later confront Mara Jade Skywalker in order to collect a severance fee from Karrde. Setting his droideka after her, Huxley was surprised as Jade and her husband, Luke Skywalker, destroyed the droid and let him escape with his life.",
