 "content": "Semist Bada was a male Human refugee who lived on Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA Human male, Semist Bada became a refugee during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the subsequent Cold War, he was part of a group of refugees who settled on Taris as part of the Republic resettlement project on the planet.\nIn 3643 BBY, he, along with his fellow settlers, were forced out of their settlement by Republic troops because the area was plagued by scavengers. When a Republic-allied individual volunteered to recover items from their settlement, Semist asked the hero to recover his novel from the settlement's computer. The individual succeeded, allowing Semist to finish the novel.\nSemist Bada was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game  released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He, along with his fellow settlers, ask Republic players to recover items from their settlement in the mission \"Prized Possessions\".",
