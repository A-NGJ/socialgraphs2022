 "content": "Cala Brin was a female Human Jedi Master who was among the founding members of the Jedi Order.\nA Force-sensitive female Human, Cala Brin was one of the founders that formed the Jedi Order on Tython. She espoused the ideas that the Jedi should dedicate their lives to upholding justice, setting aside any emotions, may it be mercy, sorrow, nor fear, to properly decide what is just. She also warned against haste in this quest, as the Jedi's judgement could affect being in all corner of the galaxy.\nFollowing the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, a hologram of Master Brin was discovered on the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython when the Order relocated from Coruscant. Hers was the second hologram reclaimed from the Tythonian Gnarls. During the Cold War, the hologram of Master Brin was threatened by Flesh Raiders, forcing Master Yuon Par to send her Padawan, the future Barsen'thor, to save it.",
