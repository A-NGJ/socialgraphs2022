 "content": "Sslanno was a Trandoshan male Nihil marauder and a member of the Tempest led by Tempest Runner Pan Eyta during the High Republic Era. At one point, he lost his scales in a plasma blast, after which they did not grow back. Sslanno once pulled out the spine of a Whiphid with his bare hands. The Nihil Andrik Keller witnessed the act, subsequently vowing to never be in the same position as the Whiphid. Keller later mentioned Sslanno while recounting how he had been pursued by the Trandoshan Jedi Master Sskeer during the Battle of Galov.\nSslanno was mentioned in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott, and the exact spelling of the character's name was revealed in its 2022 script release.",
