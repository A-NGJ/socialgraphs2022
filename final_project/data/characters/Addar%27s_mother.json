 "content": "The mother of the human male Addar helped to found the religious group known as the Church of the Force. Like his mother, Addar became a member of the church, but unlike her, he did not share in its beliefs. Despite this, he joined a group of church members who traveled to the planet Christophsis to return a crate of kyber crystals to the place that they were grown; however, in completing the mission he became trapped alone by a cave in.\nAddar's mother was first mentioned in the 2017 novel Aftermath: Empire's End, which was written by Chuck Wendig.",
