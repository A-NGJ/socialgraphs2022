 "content": "A pilot flew for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. At some point, the pilot was on patrol in a B-wing starfighter, along with Hootkins. The two Rebel pilots did not detect anything on their patrol route and were preparing to return to base when the pilot detected some unusual readings on his starfighter's sensors. Hootkins, however, did not initially detect anything and the two pilots were closing their B-wings' S-foils when they came under attack. Both starfighters were destroyed.\nThe pilot made his only appearance in a tech demo for the LucasArts video game Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire. The short video was originally created as a test of video production and compression technology, but was distributed as a trailer for the game with other LucasArts titles. It was also included with Rebel Assault II itself as an alternative opening video, accessible by holding down the 'B', 'O', and 'T' keys while selecting \"Continue Intro\" from the game's menu.\nThe character was played by Marc Bauman, who returned in the full game as the captain of the Corellia Star. Given the mysterious nature of the sensor readings, it is likely that the two B-wings were attacked by TIE/ph phantom starfighters equipped with cloaking devices. However, the attackers are not shown in the video.\nProps and costumes created for the original trilogy of Star Wars movies were used during the filming of Rebel Assault II. The flight helmet worn by the B-wing pilot was one originally created for a Y-wing pilot in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.",
