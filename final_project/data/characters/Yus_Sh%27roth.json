As a former shaper, he was a vital member of their community, knowing how to use the chuk'a they had found and grow a good deal of their food.\nSh'roth was with Kunra when Yuuzhan Vong Warriors attacked their camp. Kunra fled while Sh'roth tried to fight off the warriors, and he was killed. His death cry gave Nom Anor a warning as to the warriors' approach.",
