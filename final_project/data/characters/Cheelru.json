 "content": "Cheelru was powerful Tarasin Force witch and a member of the Inner Circle of the Wyrd. By 19 BBY her commitment to the Dark side of the Force had driven her insane. She disagreed with the Wyrd Mother over the use of the Ritual of the Power of the Dark, as this could potentially destroy the Ch'hala, which would end all that the Wyrd stood for. The Mother responded by having Cheelru chained up in a cave and left there to be a future sacrifice. The Heroes of Cularin encountered her there while they investigated the Wyrd and she told them about the Ritual.",
