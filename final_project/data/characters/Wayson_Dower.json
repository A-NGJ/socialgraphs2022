 "content": "Wayson Dower was a stormtrooper just after the end of the Clone Wars. He was a corporal in Janzor's platoon, and was friends with Milo Strander.\nHe served in the Imperial occupation of Kashyyyk, where he and Strander were the only soldiers of their 200-man unit to survive. For his bravery, he was promoted to first sergeant. He contemplated leaving Imperial service, but decided against it.\nAlthough he believed himself to be the only normal Human in his platoon, Dower was almost certainly a GeNode clone trooper, however, evidence exists that contradicts this, as he mentioned cloning to his friend Milo Strander, which is seemingly impossible for GeNode clones.",
