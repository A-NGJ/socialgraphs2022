 "content": "Chrethbac was a young male Tarasin Force Adept, who served as an ally to the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn the year 31 BBY, Chrethbac was being considered for admission into the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy of Almas, so he accompanied a group of Jedi, led by Jedi Master Kirlocca, on an expedition into the Almas Wasteland. However, Chrethbac and some of the other Jedi fell under the influence of the dark side and attacked their companions. A group of agents sent by Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk found him and he attacked them, because the dark side tricked him into thinking that they were Dark Jedi and wanted to destroy him. However, they were able to subdue him, without killing him.",
