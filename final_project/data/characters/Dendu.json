 "content": "Dendu was a Human male stormtrooper who was member of the Stormtrooper Corps during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 BBY, he was assigned aboard the Star Destroyer Imperator, along with the platoon led by Cadet Leader Kyle Katarn. He was a part of the battle on AX-456.\nLate in the mission and already low on ammo, they inspected the comm center, where a small maintenance droid saw the Imperials and squeaked. Dendu tried to shoot it but missed, and Sergeant major Hong reprimanded Dendu for wasting precious ammo.\nDendu and the others retreated to the base's cafeteria, where Rebel reinforcements killed all but six stormtroopers.",
