 "content": "Yancy was a female Human Miner who lived in the village of Torbel during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As the planet was invaded by the Separatists in 21 BBY, Yancy and the villagers were forced to supply the mines in Damotit for General Lok Durd in exchange for food. However, the people of Torbel were visited by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker who were searching for the Separatist bioweapon. As the shields failed to prevent the toxic gases from spreading, Anakin used the Force to get the shields up and save the village from destruction. However, Yancy caught a terrible fever from the gas but Obi-Wan and Greti used the Force to reduce the sickness from him and the other villagers.",
