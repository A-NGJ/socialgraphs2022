 "content": "A Human male individual served as a police officer with the Coruscant Security Force in 40 ABY. He was present at a riot in front of the Corellian Embassy on Coruscant, the Galactic Alliance capital planet. As Corellians began fighting with CSF cops and Coruscanti, who were protesting over the poisoning of the water supply by Corellians, the police fired dispersal gas against the rioting.\nJedi Ben Skywalker, who had been observing the situation, got caught in the dispersal gas and the rush of the crowd. Seeing Skywalker almost trampled, the officer pulled him out of the chaos to safety. Shortly after, the Corellian Barit Saiy shot at the officer with a blaster. However, Ben deflected the bolt with his lightsaber, saving the officer's life and preventing a violent escalation that the death of a police officer could have caused. Lying, Ben told the officer it had been a rock. With gratitude, the officer offered to take Ben home but was declined.\nThe officer appeared in Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, the second novel in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series written by Karen Traviss and published in 2006.",
