 "content": "Brafid was a male Elomin who worked as an officer on the Trader's Luck and was, therefore, permitted to walk around the vessel while armed. His weapon of choice was a type of electric prod that he liked to refer to as a \"tingler\". He was close friends with Nooni Dalvo. During Han Solo's escape from the Luck, Brafid was shot by the young Corellian.\nThere is contradiction as to what Brafid's species actually is. While in The Paradise Snare he said to be an Elomin, and is described as being hulking, and furred. However, this more accurately describes an Elom, as Elomins are relatively hairless  and stand an average of 1.6 meters.",
