 "content": "Jan-Ira Toru was a female Human who served as a member of the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Jan-Ira Toru was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at their experimental academy on the planet Almas in the Cularin system. Once selected as a Padawan, Toru constructed lightsaber and was dispatched to serve the Order throughout the star system.\nWhen the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems entered into all out war, Toru and the Devaronian Padawan Keelin Zaariq were sent by Jedi Master Devan For'deschel to bring the heroes of Cularin to the Almas Academy. They flew a shuttle to Cularin, where they met with the heroes and told them that For'deschel wished to meet with them. They then flew back to Almas, with the heroes.\nIn Twi'light Storm, there are two different ways by which the player characters can be summoned to meet with Master For'deschel, with Zaariq and Toru meeting with them being one of them.",
