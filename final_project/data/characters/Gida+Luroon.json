 "content": "Gida Luroon was a female Twi'lek who had a purple skin tone and bore a scar across her left eye. She worked as a bounty hunter on the world of Ord Mantell some time during the Galactic Civil War.\nAt some point while on Ord Mantell, Luroon was preparing to go off-world when she intercepted a transmission concerning Renci Tosh, a Human female who had just escaped from some local thugs. Unaware of Renci's connection to the Rebellion, Luroon attempted to track down and capture her alive for the offered reward - which, she assumed, would increase if she brought in anyone else assisting her quarry's escape.",
