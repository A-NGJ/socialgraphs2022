 "content": "\"Treve\" was the nickname of a clone trooper lieutenant who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, he fought in a battle on the planet Kothlis, serving under the command of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. As Treve was discussing their battle casualties with Kenobi inside a Bothan Spynet facility on Kothlis, a group of Separatist remote droids broke into the facility and attacked them. During the attack, Treve defended the General from harm, though the clone fell to droid blaster fire.\nA clone trooper lieutenant nicknamed Treve was one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett who were trained on the planet Kamino to be soldiers for the Grand Army of the Republic. In 21 BBY, the second year of the Clone Wars, Treve was sent to the planet Kothlis as part of a battle group to stop a Confederate invasion that was being led by the cyborg General Grievous. The mission proved to be difficult, mainly due to Grievous's new jamming computer virus that made all communication for the Republic forces—save for helmet comms—impossible.\nDespite this difficulty, Treve was assigned to Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi's command to protect a facility on Kothlis that was part of the Bothan Spynet. Inside the facility, Treve reported their losses from the battle to Kenobi. During their conversation, however, a group of remote droids breached the facility and attacked Kenobi. As he was protecting Kenobi from harm, Treve was killed after receiving a number of blaster shot wounds from the droids.\nTreve was a loyal yet cautious soldier who earned the trust of the equally cautious Obi-Wan Kenobi. He stood at a height of 1.83 meters like all his fellow clones from Kamino.\nTreve first appeared in the novel Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth, the first book of the Clone Wars Gambit duology, which was written by author Karen Miller and released in February 2010. In the novel, Treve appeared during the defense of the Kothlis spynet facility.",
