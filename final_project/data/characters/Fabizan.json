 "content": "Fabizan was a male Bith starship salesman active during the Cold War. In 3643 BBY, he was preparing to meet with Skavak in the Coruscant Spaceport's Docking Bay 87, but instead was met by Corso Riggs and the captain of the ship that was being Fabizan and his guards. After the smuggler and Riggs slew the guards, Fabizan explained that he was looking after the smuggler's ship while Skavak was looking for upgrades.",
