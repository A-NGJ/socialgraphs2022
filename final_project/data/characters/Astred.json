 "content": "Commander Astred was in charge of an Alliance to Restore the Republic base on the second moon of the planet Tiragga. When the base's personnel contracted the Direllian Plague, he sent out a continuous broadcast message warning ships to stay away from the base, and to head to Kirtania to procure Shiarha Root and the aid of Doctor T'Jaleq Kith'Araquia to treat the plague.\nAstred was a male Human member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, assigned as the commander of the outpost on the planet Tiragga's second moon. During the Galactic Civil War, the base's personnel were struck down by the Direllian Plague, a virulent respiratory diseases that could kill in several days. Astred contracted the disease himself, but remained on duty in his office. One of the base's medics, Keldon, recommended sending someone to the nearby planet Kirtania to acquire Shiarha Root and enlist the help of Doctor T'Jaleq Kith'Araquia, the Araquia who had first treated the plague. Astred agreed with the idea, but refused to send any of the base personnel on the errand for fear that they would be unable to complete the task. Instead, he enlisted Keldon to help him reprogram a droid to send out a continuous broadcast message. He hoped that returning supply ships would hear the message and assist them.\nAstred's actions proved correct, and a returning transport crew diverted to Kirtania, obtaining the necessary materials to cure the plague and save the base personnel.\nAstred was an old man during the time of the Galactic Civil War, but was capable of base command. He refused to abandon his duties despite being affected by the Direllian Plague, and was determined to save the personnel under his command.\nAstred appeared in The Quality of Mercy, an RPG adventure written by Nicky Rea published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 by West End Games in 1995. Astred can die during the adventure if the player characters take too long during their adventure on Kirtania. This article assumes that the player characters successfully completed the task as recommended.",
