 "content": "Grang was a Human male who was a commander in the Imperial Military of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. During the invasion of Belsavis, Grang headed Special Operations Group Three, which remained behind in the Maximum Security Section to sow chaos and clear the way while Groups One and Two continued onward in search of the Dread Masters. However, Grang's men broke open the vaults containing the Esh-kha in the Tomb, and thus were overrun and nearly wiped out. Grang and the remainder of the group retreated to the Imperial frontline camp, where he recruited other Imperials to strike back at the Esh-kha.\nColonel Grang appears on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he provides Imperial players with the mission \"Erasing the Esh-kha\" and is involved in \"Key to the Vaults\".",
