 "content": "Mu Nanb was a Sullustan male who served the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Nanb journeyed to the planet Geonosis where he attended a party held by the Geonosian Duke Piddock of the Gogum Hive on a mission to broker a weapons deal on behalf of the Alliance. During the party Nanb sat on his own and did not mingle with the other guests and he tried to conceal the try purpose of his mission by operating under a cover story that he was a tourist from Sullust who had bonded with Piddock over a shared appreciate of jatz music.\nNamb was a shy individual who was nervous during his mission to meet with Piddock on Geonosis. He supported the Rebel Alliance and passionately disliked the Galactic Empire because of their destruction of the planet Alderaan and their persecution of the Mon Calamari and Wookiee species.",
