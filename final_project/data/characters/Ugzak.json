 "content": "Ugzak was a bull Gamorrean hunter dwelling in Anchorhead 3956 BBY, a partner of Narkal and Gurke. He attempted to kill Revan along with his friends in the wastes, but was persuaded out of it.\nIn Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it is possible for Revan to accept his challenge and kill him along with his friends in the desert. If Revan does not accept the Gamorrean's challenge in the wastes, he will be called a coward by other patrons of the lodge. If Revan doesn't talk to him in the bar after their encounter, they will not fight.",
