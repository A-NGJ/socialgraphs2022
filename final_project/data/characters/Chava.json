 "content": "Chava, also known as Chava the Wise, was a female Lasat mystic who survived the fall of Lasan at the hands of the Galactic Empire. She became a refugee and, along with former Lasan High Honor Guardsman Gron, was rescued from Imperial captivity by the rebel crew of the Ghost. With the assistance of Garazeb Orrelios, a member of the Ghost crew, Chava was able to help find the way to Lira San, the ancient homeworld of the Lasat spoken of in legend. After discovering the planet, Chava remained on Lira San with the millions of Lasat who already lived there.\nChava the Wise and her traveling companion Gron, a former Lasan High Honor Guardsman, were one of the few Lasat to survive the brutal Imperial pacification of Lasan. In 3 BBY, Chava and Gron embarked on a quest to find Lira San, a legendary planet that was regarded as a sanctuary for the Lasat species. Their travels led them to smuggle themselves in a cargo container on Nixus Hub 218 where they were discovered by Imperial forces, who had been tipped off by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. However, Ohnaka had also alerted his one-time \"business partner\" Ezra Bridger.\nChava and Gron were promptly detained by Imperial stormtroopers, who intended to ship them to a detention camp. However, Ezra and his rebel cell rescued the two Lasat and overpowered their Imperial captors. Chava and Gron were delighted to learn that one of their rescuers was Garazeb Orrelios, a former Captain in the Honor Guard. As the two Lasat and their rebel rescuers made their way back to the rebels' starship Ghost, Chava told her rescuers that she and Gron were searching for Lira San. On the way, they were ambushed by more stormtroopers but managed to escape due to assistance from Ohnaka. Chava and her companions then escaped into hyperspace aboard the Ghost.\nOnce in hyperspace, Chava informed her rebel rescuers that she did not know the location of Lira San since it was only mentioned in ancient Lasat prophecy. In order to find it, Chava told her hosts that a prophesied \"child\" had to first save the \"warrior\" and the \"fool.\" When the astromech droid Chopper commented in Binary that she was \"weird,\" Chava issued an angry rebuke. With the help of Ezra, Chava and Gron began a ritual designed to help them find Lira San. While Zeb was initially unwilling to help due to his lingering guilt over his failure to safeguard the Lasat royal family and Lasan, Ezra managed to convince the former Captain to help his Lasat compatriots protect their people by finding Lira San.\nZeb reluctantly agreed to participate in the ritual. As part of the ritual, Chopper had projected a holographic map of the galaxy. Zeb then activated his bo-rifle in the ancient Lasat style which interacted with Chava's staff, producing a surge of electricity that pinpointed Lira San's location to a set of coordinates in Wild Space, an uncharted region outside of the Outer Rim Territories. Using these coordinates, Chava and her rebel hosts traveled to Lira San but found their path obstructed by a collapsed star cluster. The rebels were also trapped by an Arquitens-class command cruiser led by Agent Kallus which had emerged from hyperspace to capture or destroy them.\nAfter Agent Kallus issued his ultimatum, Chava identified Kallus as the warrior doing his part. Due to the long-time animosity between Zeb and Kallus , Zeb was initially dismissive of Chava's observation. Chava then explained that there were many warriors, fools, and children. According to the prophecy, a child saw things not as they are but how they could be while the fool denied his destiny, and the warrior created his own destiny. Chava said that no one was ever just one of them, but rather in time, assumed all of these roles. After listening Chava's words, Zeb realized that he had to forge both his own destiny and that of his people.\nUsing the bo-rifle, Zeb guided the Ghost through the collapsed star cluster. The Imperial light cruiser attempted to pursue them but was forced to retreat due to the gravitational pull of the star cluster. After passing through the gravity field, the Ghost jumped into hyperspace. Chava and her traveling companions were knocked out by a bright blaze of light. When they awoke, they sighted Lira San in the horizon. Chava and Gron accompanied Zeb on the Phantom to Lira San. There, they discovered that the planet was the original Lasat homeworld and was home to millions of Lasat already. While Chava and Gron quickly settled on their new-found home, Zeb decided to return to his rebel companions so that he could bring more Lasat to Lira San.\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, Zeb took his former Imperial foe Kallus, who had defected to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, to Lira San to show that he did not completely wipe out the Lasat people. Chava, Gron, and the other Lasat welcomed their former adversary as one of them.\nChava was covered in purple fur and had large ears and green eyes. She was an elderly woman and had long white rounded hair. Chava was an elderly Lasat mystic who revered the Force, which she referred to as the Ashla. She and her fellow refugee Gron believed in an ancient Lasat prophecy about Lira San, a world that was regarded as a safe refuge for the Lasat to start anew. As a pacifist, Chava refused to use violence even in self defense. Additionally, her prophetic ways were so much so that C1-10P remarked her as \"weird\" because of them\nChava wielded an Ashla Staff, a staff that could interact with the Force. She could speak Galactic Basic Standard and could also understand Binary, a droid language.\nChava first appeared in \"Legends of the Lasat,\" the twelfth episode of the second season of the Disney XD television series Star Wars Rebels. She was voiced by Grey Griffin.",
