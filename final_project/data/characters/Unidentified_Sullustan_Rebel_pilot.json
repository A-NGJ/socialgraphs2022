 "content": "An unidentified male Sullustan pilot was a member of the Rebel Alliance. In 1 ABY, he was killed when an YT-2400 light freighter of the Rebel Alliance crashed onto a beach near Coronet City on the planet Corellia. His body was found by an Imperial agent investigating the crash.\nThis dead Rebel was added to the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies as part of the Empire Day event of 2009. Imperial players participating in the combat quest line of the event were sent by Mara Jade to investigate the crash of the ship and search the bodies of the crash victims for intelligence.",
