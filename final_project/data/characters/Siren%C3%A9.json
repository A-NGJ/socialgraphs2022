 "content": "Sirené was a member of the Fallanassi during the High Republic Era and represented the religion on the Convocation of the Force on the moon Jedha around 382 BBY. In that year, an envoy of the Yacombe traveled to the Convocation Chambers to apply for membersip on the Convocation. Sirené, believing that the Yacombe were a dark side organization, were not prepared to stand alongside a dark sider as a follower of the White Current, and attempted to attack the envoy. Kilan, the Convocation's leader, attempted to stop Sirené, stating there was no need for their actions, which Sirené disagreed with. When the envoy's Ximpi tried to dispute the claims that the Yacombe were dark siders, Sirené dismissed the Ximpi's response as lies, calling the Yacombe dangerous aggressors who sought to divide and corrupt. The representative for the Lonto then informed Sirené that they were wrong, and that the Yacombe had renounced their allegiance to the dark side generations prior, and that they were now neutral and strove for balance in everything.\nSirené ignored the Lonto and still tried to attack, along with the Matukai representative Waran, but was prevented by the arrival of Jedi Oliviah Zeveron, who stood in defense of the envoy. Waran told Zeveron to stand aside, and Sirené concurred with the Matukai, adding that it was not Coruscant and that the Jedi had no dominace on Jedha, which Zeveron agreed with, but pointed out that whilst the Fallanassi and Matukai claimed to want to protect the light from the Yacombe, the Yacombe envoy was the only one not fighting. This made Sirené and the other representatives finally stand down, though the incident had shown the envoy that Jedha was not a place of peace and harmony, and decided to leave the chambers with their application retracted.",
