 "content": "Na-Jia was a female human living as a thief on the planet Diado during the Clone Wars. After stealing Saesee Tiin's lightsaber, he paid her for its return. She was later captured by Confederate forces, who believed her to be a Republic spy along with Tiin. She helped him recover his lightsaber from them, and the two managed to escape.\nNa-Jia first appeared in the short story It Takes a Thief, which was one of four stories in the sixth volume of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures trade paperbacks. She was created and penciled by Matthew and Shawn Fillbach. Na-Jia garnered an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
