 "content": "Rayfel was a male Human who served in the Imperial Military of the resurgent Sith Empire who was also a member of the death cult led by Executor Krannus that worshiped the Sith Emperor.\nAround 3641 BBY, Commander Rayfel and his men held a group of scientists hostage when they encountered by the Hero of Tython. Informing the Jedi that Krannus had already left, Rayfel revealed that the scientists were not just hostagesâ€”when the Commander shot one of the scientists in the back of the head, Rayfel absorbed the man's life force in order to strengthen himself. Believing that he'd grow strong in defeating the Jedi, Rayfel charged and engaged the Knight with his increased power, forcing the Hero and company to draw their weapons and defeat the Imperials.",
