 "content": "A male Human Rebel, who had a large scar running from his left eye to the right side of his jaw, was a member of the Rebel Alliance team sent to investigate Gobindi. The Galactic Empire soon put the world under lockdown as it tested the influenza necrosi virus, declaring the reason for the lockdown to be piracy. The Empire discovered the Rebel agents' presence, and declared them to be wanted as pirates.\nAfter a Rodian member of the team was arrested, the Human Rebel, Wedge Antilles, and a Bothan confederate confronted Tash Arranda, asking for her help in escaping the planet. While they spoke, the Human Rebel was attacked by a blob creature carrying influenza necrosi. Though his allies pulled the blob off, he was infected, and soon collapsed. Antilles and the Bothan took him back to their safe house.\nThe Human Rebel character appears in Galaxy of Fear: Planet Plague, in which he is last seen infected with the deadly influenza necrosi virus. The book never makes it clear whether the man survived long enough to receive the cure later created by Doctor Kavafi.",
