 "content": "These Rodians were prisoners on board the Imperial prison barge Purge around 1 BBY. Their cell was adjacent to that of Kale Longo and Trig Longo and would usually stare at the two teenage prisoners. When the Purge broke down and a search party was forced to collect parts from an abandoned Star Destroyer, the Blackwing virus spread throughout the purge and killed all but a handful of survivors. The two Rodians caught the plague and died from it, only to rise once more as zombies.",
