 "content": "Angaar was a male Rodian, who lived during the time of the Galactic Republic.\nAngaar worked as a poacher. In about 32 BBY, a meteorite crashed onto the moon Dorumaa and awoke a Dorumaan leviathan, a type of giant sea creature. Angaar and some other poachers planned to kill the creature and then loot ivory from its corpse. However, the heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system, attempted to save the leviathan, by attacking the poachers. Angaar and three other poachers tried to fight the heroes, while the poachers Harkaan and Pardo attacked the leviathan with a submersible. However, the heroes eventually defeated the poachers and saved the leviathan.",
