 "content": "Capo was a Rodian who served in the Peace Brigade during the Yuuzhan Vong War. As of 28 ABY, Capo was serving as the admiral of the Peace Brigade Fleet.\nAuthor Walter Jon Williams likely intended the Rodian Peace Brigader Admiral Capo to be the same character as Capo, a Rodian Peace Brigader who appeared in the earlier novel The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial. However, the original Capo was killed in that book, rendering this Capo a new character.",
