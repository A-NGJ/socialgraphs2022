 "content": "Nord Kandende was a human male who served in the Galactic Empire as a pilot and lieutenant of the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. During the Galactic Civil War, Kandende had disrupted a welcome party for the Edict's crew. After the attack on Pandem Nai, the remnants of the 204th remained on the Aerie with a messenger droid. On one occasion, Kandende approached the messenger, unaware that the wing's commanding officer, Major Soran Keize, was nearby watching. Kandende cut his own hand, allowing the blood to spill, and grabbed the messenger's hand, but the droid did not react.\nDuring the second Operation: Cinder, Kandende participated in a battle in the Ghonoath system. He was elevated to flight commander of Squadron Four after the death of Flight Commander Garl Lykan.\nDuring a battle in the Chadawa system, he was specially selected as part of Yrica Quell's team for a mission to the Netalych system, to determine the programming of the Emperor's messenger droid. During the mission, as payment for data recovery work from the droid known as the \"Surgeon,\" he pledged one year as a human servant. He made the sacrifice in service to the Empire and considered the sacrifice minor.\nWithin four months after the Battle of Jakku, Kandende was recruited by Nath Tensent to work in his freelancing crew.\nNord Kandende first appeared in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed.",
