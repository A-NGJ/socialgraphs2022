 "content": "This Clone Commander was a Clone Commander who was part of the military unit led by Jedi General Chiata and Jedi Commander Marseph, and was stationed aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer. The commander and his forces participated in a battle against a Separatist dreadnought, and although they destroyed it, the Venator was heavily damaged. When the ship exited hyperspace, it crashed on the planet Zeffo. Surviving the crash, the commander and General Chiata were attempting to search for other survivors when Order 66 was issued, which forced all clones to turn on and execute their Jedi officers. In the ensuing skirmish, the Clone Commander was killed by Chiata in self-defense.\nGrown on the planet Kamino from the DNA of Jango Fett, a bounty hunter who became the template of the clone trooper army, this clone served as a Clone Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic by the end of the Clone Wars as the clone commanding officer of the military division led by Jedi General Chiata and Jedi Commander Marseph.\nShortly prior to the end of the Clone Wars, the Jedi, the Clone Commander and their unit were headquartered in a Venator-class Star Destroyer and participated in a battle against a Separatist dreadnought. During the battle, the Separatist dreadnought was heavily damaged, as was the Republic Star Destroyer. The Star Destroyer jumped into hyperspace and then crashed on the planet Zeffo.\nAfter crash landing on Zeffo, the commander organized squads to look for Marseph and other clone trooper survivors. Shortly thereafter the commander received Order 66. Eventually during the subsequent skirmish on Zeffo, the commander was killed by a lightsaber wielded by one of the Jedi. In 14 BBY, after the implementation of Order 66, Jedi Padawan survivor Cal Kestis came across bodies of the commander's unit, where he picked up transmissions the commander had before his death, as well as a hologram recording of the commander. Cal eventually found the commander's body in the wreckage of the Venator's broken wing.\nThe commander was not one to shy from a fight, despite having odds against him. The commander had a very close friendship and loyalty to Chiata as he tried to calm her down when she worried about Marseph after the crash of the ship. This friendship broke when Palpatine issued Order 66, although this was not the commander's fault as the activation of his inhibitor chip made it almost impossible to defy Palpatine's order.\nThe commander wore Phase II clone trooper armor with yellow and gray markings similar to the 13th Battalion, and was further equipped with a yellow and black pauldron.",
