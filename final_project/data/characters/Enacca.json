 "content": "Enacca was a brown-furred female Wookiee who lived on Coruscant during the Clone Wars. An associate of Kal Skirata, she was often put in charge of logistics for Skirata's black ops missions. Enacca transferred prisoners from Arca Company Barracks to a safe house she secured during Omega Squad and Delta Squad's mission to Coruscant in the second year of the Clone Wars. She also provided transportation and rounded up speeders that had to be abandoned during the course of the mission.\nShortly before the Battle of Kashyyyk she accompanied General Etain Tur-Mukan and Delta Squad to Kashyyyk to liberate her home world and keep an eye on Etain for Skirata. After RC-1207 was lost in battle Enacca forcibly removed Etain from the Kashyyyk and took her back to Coruscant to rendezvous with the Skirata Clan before they departed for Mandalore. She was one of the last to see Etain alive before the Jedi was killed in the Great Jedi Purge.",
