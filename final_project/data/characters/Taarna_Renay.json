 "content": "Taarna Renay was a female smuggler who often worked out of Point Nadir. She frequented the Under the Table cantina, where she would make contacts for new jobs.\nRenay was a very prolific smuggler, and would carry any cargo with a minimum amount of questions. She had a co-pilot named Polien Frue. She was fast, carried a blaster on her hip and was known to fight dirty when she needed to.\nDressed in the fashion of a Corellian scoundrel, Renay wore tight black pants, knee-high boots, a collared shirt, and a black leather vest.",
