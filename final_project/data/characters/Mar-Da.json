 "content": "Mar-Da was a male Voss Mystic living on Voss long before the Galactic War. He discovered a dangerous Forbidden Ritual and after his death remained as a spirit in the Shrine of Healing to protect its secrets.\n\nWhen Lord Kallig came looking for the ritual in order to gain control of the spirits they had bound, he ordered them to turn back as the ritual was forbidden. However, the young Sith used their powers to bind him, forcing him to explain the nature of the ritual.\nMar-Da appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Sith Inquisitor class mission on Voss. The player can choose to either bind him for dark-side points or use the force to persuade him to reveal what the ritual entailed. If he is bound, the player is then given the option to either release him or continue to bind him, neither of which affect the player's alignment. Since Kallig is an Imperial character, it is assumed they took all dark side options.",
