 "content": "Guzald was an old Devaronian male and former slave to the Galactic Empire. After being freed by the Kadri'Ra crime lord Saadoon-Kauldi, Guzald willingly served Kauldi as his personal translator.\nGuzald was a Devaronian who had been enslaved by the Galactic Empire, ordered to work in a garbage pontoon, along with hundreds of other slaves. At some point, due to his slavery, Guzald was forced to learn the hard language of the Kadri'Ra species, as well as many other languages. Having grow older than many, the common vigour and fire of young Devaronians had faded in him.\nEventually, Guzald and the other slaves were liberated by Saadoon-Kauldi, a Kadri'Ra crime lord and former slave himself who had began a crusade against slavery. Many of the prisoners that Saadoon-Kauldi released swore loyalty to Saadoon-Kauldi, and Guzald was one of those.\nConsidering Saadoon-Kauldi the closest thing to his king, Guzald remained to his side. Although Guzald had a family at that point, all of them were Imperial slaves and as such he had no contact with them.\nBy chance, Saadoon-Kauldi felt that he should refuse to speak Galactic Basic Standard, as a protest against the Empire. Guzald had a good chance to become his personal translator, a duty he performed proudly and loyally.",
