 "content": "Sparkle was the name given to a cu-pa owned by the family of Thei, a female Human from Nam Chorios. When Thei was five years old, she and her mother rode Sparkle from their farmstead to Ruby Gulch. Two days later, only Thei returned with no memory of what happened.\nYears later, Thei started experiencing emotional breaks whenever she smelled topato soup. She underwent treatment under Taru Durn, a Theran Listener, and her repressed memory of her last moments with her mother was discovered. Thei and her mother ate a meal of topato soup and later spent the night on a cave during their trip, but the cave ground wasn't able to support Sparkle's weight and it collapsed, plunging Sparkle into a hole full of drochs. Thei's mother went to investigate and fell into the hole as well. Thei witnessed their deaths before running away.\nSparkle was long-furred, young, and unusually long-legged.",
