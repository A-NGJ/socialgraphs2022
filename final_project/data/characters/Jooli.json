 "content": "Jooli was a male human who served as the Chancellor and chamberlain of Shu-Torun during the Galactic Civil War. He became chamberlain around 40 BBY. While at a sacred ancestral retreat for the Shu-Torun royalty, a vessel belonging to ore-duke Rubix attacked. Darth Vader, the Galactic Emperor's chief enforcer, sank the vessel in Shu-Torun's magma surface, and Queen Trios helped him escape. When the two returned to the palace, Jooli approached the Queen, saying that her position was ceremonial, and such actions were dangerous. Upon hearing this, Vader threatened Jooli, saying that the chamberlain was in more danger than the Queen had been. Soon after, when Jooli refused to let Trios declare war on the ore barons, she ordered one of her guards to kill the chamberlain, calling him a traitor.\nJooli was a human male who was from the Mid Rim planet Shu-Torun. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Jooli served the royal family of Shu-Torun as the Chancellor and chamberlain of the ore-rich world.\nJooli first appeared in Darth Vader  17, a comic book written by Kieron Gillen, illustrated by Salvador Larroca, and published by Marvel Comics in 2016.Larroca based Jooli's physical appearance in that of the late Constantino Romero, who voiced Darth Vader in the Spanish dub of the films.",
