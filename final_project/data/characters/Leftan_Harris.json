 "content": "Leftan Harris was a Human male who was a member of the Intarsa League criminal faction during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Around 31 BBY, Harris and the League were aboard a shuttle traveling en-route the planet Cularin on a mission to setup a shell company as a front for their operations when they were attacked by a rival group of criminals. The shuttle crashed in the grounds of the Blue Star Centre, a philosophical research facility and Harris and the surviving members of the Intarsa League entered the facility and took its inhabitants hostage in an attempt to gain passage off of Cularin. However, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in and around the Cularin system, attacked the Intarsa League and defeated Harris and the other crash survivors to free the hostages.",
