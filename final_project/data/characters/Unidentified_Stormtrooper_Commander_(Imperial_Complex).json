 "content": "A Stormtrooper Commander of the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps was stationed on Lothal during the Galactic Civil War. He assisted the Sith Lord Darth Vader in hunting down a band of rebels that were trying to escape the planet. Alongside Vader, the officer led several stormtroopers inside the Imperial Complex on Lothal. After the rebels managed to escape by stealing an Imperial shuttle, the Commander approached Darth Vader and told the Sith that he would deploy TIE fighters to pursue the fleeing rebels, although the Sith Lord told the trooper that it would be unncessary since he predicted that the rebels would not leave Lothal yet, setting up a planetary blockade instead to prevent them from escaping.\nThe Stormtrooper Commander is voiced by Steve Blum, who also voices the Lasat rebel Garazeb Orrelios in Star Wars Rebels.",
