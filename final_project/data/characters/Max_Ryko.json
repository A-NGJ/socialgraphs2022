He served as a police officer with the Coruscant Police Force where he held the rank of captain.\nMax Ryko was a Human male originally from the planet of Ord Mantell. Ryko later lived on the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant where he became police officer. He eventually attained the rank of captain in the Coruscant Police Force. However, Ryko was able to discover information on a well-known senator concerning his personal affairs. He attempted to blackmail the senator and threatened to go public with the information. The Techno Union, wanting to prevent this, issued a bounty for Ryko. They offered 3,000 credits for him alive and 1,500 for him dead.\nIn 32 BBY, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett tracked down Ryko in Coruscant's Financial District and collected on the reward.\nRyko was a Human male with light skin. When on duty, he wore his CSF uniform and carried a blaster.\nMax Ryko first appeared in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter a single player game released on December 5, 2002.
