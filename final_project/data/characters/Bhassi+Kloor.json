When a group of Tarasin discovered that the caverns were being used by the Syndicate, Kloor and Neebuk Garbos, Impeveri's other bodyguard, pursued and killed all but one of the Tarasin. A short time later, Kloor and Garbos fought against the Heroes of Cularin in the Ishkik caverns, but were defeated.",
