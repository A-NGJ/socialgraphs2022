 "content": "Tarast Voon was a Force-sensitive Kel Dor male who traveled to Spintir to hone his Force abilities.\nPrior to the formation of the Galactic Empire and the fall of the Jedi, Tarast Voon attempted to join the Jedi Order. However, they declined due to him being too old for training.\nBy the time of the start of the Empire, Voon had to go into hiding due to his Force-sensitive nature making him a fugitive against the Empire's anti-Jedi policies. Fifteen years later, he eventually encountered Hethan Romund, who taught him to construct his lightsaber. However, they parted ways after a close call with an Imperial agent.\nAfter Romund was captured by the dark sider Malefax in 0 ABY, Voon joined with other individuals to rescue her.",
