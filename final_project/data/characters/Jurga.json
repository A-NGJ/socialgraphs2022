 "content": "Jurga was a Hutt male crime lord that operated in the galaxy. He was known to openly wear a DX-2 disruptor pistol, built by the criminal Tenloss Syndicate, on a sash to symbolize his power in defiance of laws that were in place on many planets, which made the ownership of disruptor weapons to be a capital offense. Jurga was later disintegrated with his own weapon by an outraged employee.\nJurga the Hutt was first mentioned in an entry for Tenloss disruptor weapons in the 2002 Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game sourcebook Arms \u0026 Equipment Guide, which was written by Jeff Grubb and Owen K.C. Stephens.",
