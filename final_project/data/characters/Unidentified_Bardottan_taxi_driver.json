 "content": "A male Bardottan taxi driver worked on the planet Lothal during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign. One location he picked up passengers from was the ground transport area in the spaceport of Lothal's Capital City. Ezra Bridger, a street urchin native to Lothal, considered the Bardottan the finest taxi driver available in the city and suggested his services to a wealthy Chagrian looking to travel to the nearby Monad Outpost in order to watch the Gladiator Night event.\nThe Bardottan was first mentioned in Ezra's Gamble, a junior novel written by Ryder Windham and released in 2014. The book did not reveal the driver's name, or if the Chagrian actually used his services.",
