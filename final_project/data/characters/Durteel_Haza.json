He looked up from the game when Maz Kanata, the owner of the castle, shouted out to the smuggler Han Solo.\nDurteel Haza was a Delphidian male who spent time in Takodana Castle on the planet Takodana in 34 ABY. He was stood at a table with fellow patrons Wollivan and Praster Ommlen as well as several humans watching a fighting droid match when the smuggler Han Solo entered the room with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn, and the Astromech droid BB-8.\nWhen Maz Kanata, owner of the castle, spotted Solo, she shouted to him across the room, causing all the patrons to go silent as Haza and the others looked up swiftly from the game. Once Kanata went over to greet Solo, everyone returned to their business, but soon after many of the patrons were drawn outside to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The castle was then attacked and destroyed by the forces of the First Order, who were in search of BB-8. Haza was mentioned in an artist's journal, which was restored, expanded, and displayed by the Graf Archive at some point after 34 ABY.\nDurteel Haza had dark gray skin and black eyes.\nWhile at the castle, Haza wore a black and copper-colored outfit. He also wore a dark gray headpiece, which included a small light that could shine blue or white, but chose to keep his face visible.\nDurteel Haza was portrayed by Cavin Cornwall, who also portrayed Sidon Ithano, in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. Cornwall kept Haza's makeup on underneath the mask of Ithano's costume and the characters were later identified as members of the same species. The character was first identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia, which was written by Adam Bray, Cole Horton and Tricia Barr.",
