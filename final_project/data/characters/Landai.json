 "content": "Landai was a female Mirialan Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War and Galactic War against the Sith Empire. Landai was a member of a group of Jedi led by Master Surro, and the group adopted a sixth line to the Jedi Code—\"There is no contemplation, there is only duty.\" The team served as the Galactic Republic's scouts on the planet Balmorra after Grand Marshal Cheketta's defeat at the Balmorran Arms Factory, and the group suffered a loss when one of their number, Danak, was killed by Imperials after being exposed by a Twi'lek named Ivo. Years later, the group—now officially known as the Sixth Line and in the employ of the Republic Strategic Information Service—was deployed on the planet Ziost by Theron Shan, but Landai and the others fell under the control of the former Sith Emperor Vitiate. During the Invasion of Ziost that followed, Vitiate used Landai and Master Onok as puppets, and the two were defeated in battle in the People's Tower in the city of New Adasta. During the final confrontation with Tenebrae, Landai was among the spirits witnessing his final death.\nLandai was first introduced in the short story The Sixth Line, released shortly before Game Update 3.2: Rise of the Emperor was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Landai and Onok appear in the mission \"Dead Center\" in the update, and players can choose to shock them into unconsciousness, earning light side alignment points, or kill them, earning dark side alignment points.",
