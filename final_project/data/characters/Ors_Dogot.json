 "content": "Ors Dogot was a male Human and former Captain in the Imperial Navy.\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor, Ors stayed at his station at Prakith and became a captain in the Grand Imperial Navy commanding the Bloodprice. He liked to \"examine\" his new female crew members and was in the process of \"examining\" Yeoman Cligot when he was told of a large ship that had entered Prakith's system. He thought it would be his day as the ship had no visible weapons. The Bloodprice's aggression at the stray alien ship led to the latter's retaliation, destroying the Imperial spacecraft, thus dooming all onboard.",
