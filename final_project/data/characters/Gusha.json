 "content": "Gusha was a green-furred, red-eyed Lepi whose name translated from Huttese to Galactic Basic Standard as \"Lucky.\" As the owner and bartender of the Gusha's Luck cantina in Tatooine's spaceport city of Mos Eisley, Gusha was on-duty in 137 ABY when the bounty hunter Cade Skywalker and his co-pilot Jariah Syn were seated at the bar. After Syn left, Gusha poured two glasses of Merenzane Gold for the Imperial agent Gunn Yage, into one of which she slipped a drug in order to knock Skywalker unconscious. Yage took her prey elsewhere, and when Syn returned shortly thereafter, Gusha told the co-pilot of the events that had transpired in his absence.\nGusha appeared in the thirty-eighth issue of the Star Wars: Legacy comic-book series, written by John Ostrander, illustrated by Jan Duursema, and published by Marvel Comics on July 29, 2009. A glossary included in the issue's letters section indicates that the word Gusha translates to \"Lucky\" in Huttese meaning that Gusha's cantina could be called \"Lucky's Luck.\"",
