 "content": "Kriki was a female Chadra-Fan with skills in improving and modifying technology. She worked for Gol in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, but chose to join Vi Moradi's group of Resistance members. Her familiarity with the outpost and skills with mechanic and technological work made her a valuable asset to the group. She played a fundamental role in the plan to remove Lieutenant Wulfgar Kath's First Order presence on Batuu, sabotaging his transport's systems and programming it to send a fake message to the Penumbra and subsequently explode.\nKriki lost her sister in the Hosnian Cataclysm, and wore a small rock on her necklace that was thought to be a piece of debris from the event as a means of remembering her.",
