 "content": "Yansu Grjak was a member of the Nightsisters of Dathomir during the time of the Clone Wars.\nYansu was a shaman of the Nightsisters who lived during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. She and her fellow sister Sai Sircu led an army of their lightsaber-wielding followers at the beginning of the war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, after abandoning their homeworld, Dathomir due to leadership disputes with the Nightsisters. At that time, they formed an alliance with Count Dooku in order to bring about the downfall of the Jedi Order.\nDuring the conflict, she encountered two Jedi who attempted to fight her. Grjak thus sent her fellow Nightsisters against the Jedi, allowing herself to flee in a Sith Infiltrator ship.\nLater she was sent to Rodia, where she was chased down by a pair of Jedi, and despite her powers, she was killed by the pair, weakened by crystals being thrown at her by the Jedi via the Force.",
