During the Cold War, he commanded the Republic forces on Coruscant.\nStationed on Coruscant during the Cold War with the Sith Empire, General Wendin was in charge of the Republic forces of the planet.\nDuring the year 3643 BBY, Wendin sent Republic forces to recover an astrogation computer from the ruins of the Jedi Temple. They encountered and an Imperial presence in The Works and the ruins, which was also trying to find the computer. The computer contained secret hyperspace routes discovered by Jedi hundreds of years ago, and it would give either side a powerful advantage in the Cold War.\nAn individual acting on behalf of the Republic recovered the device for the Republic, and gave it to General Wendin at his command center in the Senate Tower.\nGeneral Wendin was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. he appears in the Coruscant Heroic Mission \"Enemies of the Republic\", where he accepts the astrogation computer that the players retrieved from the Temple.",
