 "content": "Ixxis Cranata was an Ithorian storyteller from Ithor, regarded as one of the best his people had ever known. Every day he would sit and relate tales to anybody who would listen. Such was his popularity that several authors traveled to Ithor in order to hear him speak and later wrote down his tales.\nAfter the death of Emperor Palpatine, New Republic historians visited Ithor in the hopes that Cranata could help them recover some of the stories lost when Palpatine rewrote history.",
