 "content": "A Human male with a frizzy brown beard was part of Queen Amidala's Royal Advisory Council in 32 BBY. Like other members of the Council, this man was in charge of a specific ministry, and his task was to assist the queen in her rule. He was in the Theed Royal Palace during a meeting between Queen Amidala and the Council immediately prior to the Invasion of Naboo.\nThis councilman was one of the many background characters seen in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first movie of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Like many others, he was portrayed by an unknown extra.\nThis character is one of the only two members of the Royal Advisory Council that are still unnamed in canon. It should also be noted that, while their peers were seating around Queen Amidala, the bearded councilor and his unidentified colleague were standing in the room.",
