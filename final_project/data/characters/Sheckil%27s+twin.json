 "content": "A Human individual had a twin brother named Sheckil, who was native to Concord Dawn, an Outer Rim Territories planet. By 3 ABY, the individual became a famous mercenary while Sheckil became a lieutenant in the Galactic Empire.\nSheckil's twin was first referenced on the \"Lieutenant Sheckil\" card from the 1997 Cloud City Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. The card mentioned Sheckil being from Concord Dawn and being a famous mercenary's twin, while likewise actor Jeremy Bulloch had played both Sheckil and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Prior to the card set's release, Boba Fett was established to have been from Concord Dawn as well in the 1996 short story \"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett,\" which was published in the Tales of the Bounty Hunters anthology. However, any possibility of Sheckil's twin being Boba Fett was trumped by the release of the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which established Fett as a clone created on the planet Kamino.",
