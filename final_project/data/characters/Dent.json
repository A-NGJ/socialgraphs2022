 "content": "Dent was a human individual who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Dent worked aboard the second Death Star during its construction along with Bevelyn. After finishing their shift for the day, Dent asked Bevelyn if they would see her in the bar later that evening, to which Bev responded that she was unsure, though unless she had been thrown out of an air lock for insubordination it would be a safe bet she would be there.",
