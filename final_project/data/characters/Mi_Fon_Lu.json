 "content": "Doctor Mi Fon Lu was a Sullustan archaeologist who once wanted to study the Jedi Enclave ruins on the planet Mustafar. However, he had some trouble studying the ruins due to a group of dark Force users calling themselves the Blackguard, who made their headquarters there. Eventually, Mi Fon Lu hired a bounty hunter to eliminate the group, and was finally able to gain access when the bounty hunter successfully defeated them. The Doctor rewarded the bounty hunter with 5,000 credits and a Mustafarian Distance Globe. It is rumored that the remnants of the Blackguard eventually took back the ruins and sought revenge on him.\nMi Fon Lu appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
