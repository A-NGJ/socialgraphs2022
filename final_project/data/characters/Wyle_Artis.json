 "content": "Wyle Artis was a male Sullustan amateur hunter who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he resided on Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. In 1 ABY, he met a spacer whom he hired to hunt flits and scyks in Tansarii Point Station's atrium. Artis was enthusiastic about hunting but not particularly skilled at it. He was also very clumsy, which was why he felt he couldn't take on the creatures himself and hired help. Nevertheless, he pretended to have previously hunted and killed a Corellian sand panther and even a krayt dragon. Wyle Artis later used the flit feathers and the scyk teeth to make a necklace for his wife. As a reward he presented the spacer with a hunting necklace plus a small amount of credits.\nWyle Artis was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Wyle Artis was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. He gave the player a single optional side quest.",
