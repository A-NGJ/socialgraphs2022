 "content": "Jensyn was a Human male Jedi who served as commander in the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War.\nBy 3637 BBY Jensyn secretly became a member of the Order of Revan and participated in the Korriban Incursion orchestrated by Colonel Rian Darok, a fellow Revanite. Jensyn arrived on Korriban with reinforcements and struck down Dark Council member Darth Soverus in the Dark Council chambers inside the Sith Academy. After the Republic strike team that cleaned Jensyn's way inside the Academy reported back to Colonel Darok, Jensyn secretly recovered a Rakata artifact from the Academy and arranged for its transportation offworld. Before Jensyn could leave though, he was confronted by an Imperial strike team that came to retake the Sith Academy. Realizing that his destiny was happening, Jensyn engaged his opponents but was overpowered and mortally wounded. As he lay dying, Jensyn defiantly stated \"It's already happening,\" but died without giving an explanation over the plan or revealing Revan's plan to build the Infinite Army.\nJensyn is voiced by Steve Blum.",
