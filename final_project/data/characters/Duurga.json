 "content": "Duurga was the clone of the Hutt Crime lord Durga Besadii Tai created by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Duurga was created from samples collected by Luuke Skywalker, a clone of the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker who had been killed in 9 ABY and replaced with the clone. Duurga's template was not replaced before his death aboard the Darksaber superweapon in 12 ABY. Skywalker could not understand why Thrawn kept Duurga around, but speculated that it was so the Hutt could keep the frog population down in the marsh behind his palace. After Thrawn cloned the Wookiee Chewbacca following the latter's death in the year 25 ABY, Thrawn enjoyed pairing Duurga with the clone, Chewbaacca, for arm-wrestling matches. Eventually, Chewbaaca pulled one of Duurga's arms out of its socket during one of these matches. Duuurga, another clone of Durga created by Thrawn, was not allowed near Chewbaacca after that. Like the original Durga, Duurga was 3.7 meters tall, had no hair, and had orange eyes.\nDuurga was mentioned in \"An Apology,\" a non-canon short story written by Timothy Zahn that was released on April 1, 2012 as an April Fools' Day joke. While the original Durga identified as male in his appearances, the short story did not specify if Duurga did the same. In the context of \"An Apology,\" actions taken by characters after they were cloned were performed by clone imposters. Durga was not replaced before his death, and he could not play a role in another Star Wars story afterward; therefore, his clones did not.",
