 "content": "Estoc was a female human Imperial officer of the Galactic Empire, serving as a lieutenant and later as a commander.\nAt some point, Estoc was stationed on the planet Kethmandi. During her time there, she was transporting prisoners on a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport to a Imperial prison on Kethmandi. Two prisoners, Chewbacca and Lena Freemaker, tried to escape but only Lena managed to escape and Chewbacca did not. Lena later made her way to the prison to find a way off the planet.\nDuring her escape, Lena ran right into Pace who was trying to hide from Graballa the Hutt because he owed a Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor to him. Then a stormtrooper and Dengar spotted the two and Lena and Pace took off on a speeder and later escaped them. The two eventually reached an Imperial transport which was heading to the planet Vandor.\nPace and Lena landed on the planet Vandor. Later they entered a bar with several individuals; one of them, Lando Calrissian, made a deal that included the capture of corusca gems from a corusca gem comet. During their discussion about this task, a male Narquois named Pru Sweevant, who worked for Graballa, reported Pace Lena to the Hutt. When Graballa found out that Estoc was searching for Lena, he contacted Estoc about the fugitive.\nWhen Pace, Lena, Calrissian and L3-37 reached the comet, they started to obtain the gems, but Graballa and Estoc arrived. They caught Calrissian's ship, the Millennium Falcon, into a tractor beam. Pace and Lena hid behind the comet with the chance to escape with the gems but stayed. They released the gems onto Graballa's ship and Estoc's Y-45 armored transport hauler, disabling both vessels and allowing Pace, Lena, Calrissian and L3-37 to escape.\nAfter the Rebel Alliance leaders Princess Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker fled aboard The Wheel, Estoc gave a hologram report warning the residents about the presence of the rebels. Estoc then led a squad of stormtroopers to search Freemaker Salvage and Repair in the Middle Ring for any signs of the rebel fugitives.\nKordi and Zander Freemaker hid Princess Leia inside a trash box before Lieutenant Estoc and her troopers could enter the garage. Kordi and Zander claimed not to have seen the rebels but allowed the Imperials to search their business. When Estoc noticed the absence of the starship StarScavenger, Kordi claimed that the ship had departed on a salvage mission. In reality, Luke, Rowan Freemaker, and the battle droid R0-GR had taken the ship on an accidental trip. Kordi and Zander then tried to push out the trash box but Estoc followed and pointed out that they had missed the trash incinerator. Kordi denied hiding rebels inside the box but dumped Leia and the contents inside the trash incinerator to escape Estoc's inquisitiveness. Satisfied, Estoc and her troopers left while Kordi and Zander rescued Leia.\nFollowing a pursuit throughout the Wheel, Lieutenant Estoc and her stormtroopers cornered Kordi and Leia at a diner in the Middle Ring. While searching the diner, her troopers found Kordi hiding inside a pot. Unable to find Leia, Estoc ordered her troopers to send Kordi to a dreary prison planet. At that moment, Leia resurfaced from hiding inside an alien's hair and used a plate to knock out the stormtroopers. Leia kicked Estoc out of the diner and the Imperial officer was sucked up by a passing garbage truck.\nAfter reuniting with Zander, the Freemakers and Leia returned to the Freemaker Garage where they sent out the rebels' Y-wing into space. The starfighter was promptly destroyed by two Imperial TIE fighters. Shortly later, Estoc and her stormtroopers entered the Freemaker Garage to confront Kordi and Zander. When the siblings claimed that Leia had forced them to help at gunpoint, Estoc realised they were lying but left them alone because she believed that Luke and Leia were dead. Believing this would boost her career, she and the stormtroopers went to celebrate. In her absence, the Freemakers helped Leia and her brother Luke, who had just returned from an adventure to Felucia, to escape by selling them a Z-wing at a much reduced price.\nAfter the Freemakers attacked Imperial forces on Kashyyyk, Commander Estoc was assigned with picking up the surviving AT-AT commander and his men. Estoc then traveled with the AT-AT commander aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Desolator to an Imperial repair facility near Alzoc III, which was orbited by several Star Destroyers. Estoc complained that the Imperial bureaucracy had overbooked the repair yards.\nShortly later, a squadron of X-wing starfighters known as Blue Squadron exited hyperspace. Believing that the fighters did not pose a threat, Estoc ordered the Imperials to switch off the proximity alarms. Before Imperial forces could shoot down the fighters, the Freemakers' starship Arrowhead exited hyperspace. The AT-AT commander panicked, recognizing the ship that had devastated his forces on Kashyyyk.\nZander used the Arrowhead's embersteel blade to slice off the bridge of a Star Destroyer before devastating the docked Star Destroyers. The AT-AT commander tried to convince Estoc to retreat but she ordered the Star Destroyers to open fire. The Arrowhead sliced through a second Star Destroyer before flying through several more warships, causing them to explode.\nSeeking to curry the Empire's favor, Estoc tried to trap the Arrowhead with her Star Destroyer's tractor beam projector. However, Zander got Blue Squadron's leader Lieutenant Valeria to disable the projector, allowing the Arrowhead to slice the Desolator in half. While the AT-AT commander confirmed that the Arrowhead was indeed the ship his men had encountered, Estoc frowned in humiliation.\nLieutenant Estoc was a stern, no-nonsense Imperial officer. She was known for her inquisitive nature and could discern when someone was lying. Estoc eagerly led a manhunt for Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. Despite her eagerness, she was bested by Leia in physical combat. Estoc also fell for a ruse when the Freemakers sent out the rebels' Y-wing as a decoy and mistakenly believed Luke and Leia had perished. An ambitious woman, she viewed the purported deaths of Luke and Leia as a chance to advance her career.\nEstoc's pride and confidence in Imperial technological superiority and firepower led her to underestimate the threat posed by the Arrowhead, a new powerful starship built by the Freemakers. Ultimately, this caused Estoc her Star Destroyer and pride.\nLieutenant Estoc was voiced by Jane Leeves in the non-Canon LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures episode \"Crossing Paths\", which premiered on Disney XD on July 11, 2016.",
