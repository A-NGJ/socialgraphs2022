 "content": "Arkoff was a Wookiee male Jedi Master of the Jedi Order during the High Republic Era. The Wookiee Jedi served on the remote planet Banchii, working with the Jedi Knight Lily Tora-Asi and several Padawans. In the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Arkoff and the other Jedi on Banchii assisted people who had been displaced by the catastrophe.\nThe Wookiee Arkoff served the Jedi Order during the time of the High Republic Era, attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Arkoff was stationed at the Jedi Temple on the remote planet Banchii, alongside the Jedi Knight Lily Tora-Asi and a number of Padawans. In the time following the Great Hyperspace Disaster around the year 232 BBY, Arkoff and the Jedi of Banchii assisted those who had been displaced by the disaster, including settlers from Ta'klah. The Jedi also had to respond to a surprise attack on Banchii by the sentient carnivorous plants known as the Drengir in the time leading up to the Republic Fair.\nA Wookiee, Arkoff had braided face fur and was considered to be old by the Padawan Bell Zettifar around the time of the Great Disaster. When Jedi Padawans on Banchii were excited by news of the Republic Fair, Arkoff reminded them that as Jedi, there was an order to their responsibilities, of which helping the people on Banchii was the most important.\nPadawan Zettifar considered Arkoff to be skilled in lightsaber combat; when he witnessed Jedi Master Porter Engle fighting off mole mines during a Nihil raid on the planet Elphrona, he judged Engle's lightsaber skills to be beyond anything he had seen from Arkoff. As a Wookiee, Arkoff spoke the Shyriiwook language.\nArkoff wore a set of Jedi robes with a belt and gauntlets as well as a darker outer robe. Arkoff also utilized a lightsaber in combat.\nCreated for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative, Arkoff was first mentioned in the novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule and published on January 5, 2021. On January 27, Star Wars: The High Republic Show unveiled concept art of Arkoff, who subsequently appeared in the first volume of the manga series Star Wars: The High Republic: The Edge of Balance, written by Justina Ireland and Shima Shinya, illustrated by Mizuki Sakakibara, and published on September 7, 2021.",
