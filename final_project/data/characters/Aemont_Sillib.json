 "content": "Aemont Sillib was a Muun that served the InterGalactic Banking Clan as a loan officer during the early years of the New Order. He worked diligently to change his position in the social and economic hierarchy of Muunilinst. Born into a low-level clan, Sillib was first employed to oversee a south polar mine-spire. His skills with diplomacy and tact earned him regular promotions, until he was named a loan officer and assigned an office in Harnaidan. Sillib hoped one day to become chairman of the IGBC and was determined to make this dream a reality.",
