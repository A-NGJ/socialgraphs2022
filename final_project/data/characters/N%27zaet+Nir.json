 "content": "N'zaet Nir was a male Human who is from Mayro and a member of the Corporate Sector Authority Direx Board. During the Clone Wars he was one of six civilians taken hostage in the Galactic City spaceport hostage siege by Korunnai terrorists. They had rigged the other hostages with dummy explosives and forced Nir to swap clothes with one of the terrorists. When Galactic Republic forces stormed the room he was nearly misidentified and shot by a commando, but was saved by the actions of Kal Skirata, who had infiltrated the room earlier in the siege.\nIt became apparent afterward that the terrorists had intended that Nir be killed, thereby creating tension between the Republic and CSA, who were neutral in the conflict with the Separatists.",
