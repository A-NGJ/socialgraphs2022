 "content": "Skad was a human male who was a member of a street gang that operated in the city of Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine. Residing in the Worker's District, the gang's members often stole water due to the high prices and the lack of work available in the city. When Daimyo Boba Fett became aware of the gang's activities, he went to confront them, but learned of their circumstances, instead allowing the criminals to work for him. After being recruited by the Daimyo, Skad and the other members of the gang fought off the gladiator Krrsantan when the Hutts known as the Twins sent him to kill Fett, and later chased the Twi'lek majordomo of Mayor Mok Shaiz through Mos Espa's streets. He later staked out the spaceport for reconnaissance, catching the arrival of the Pyke Syndicate operatives and reporting this to Boba and Fennec Shand\nSkad appeared in \"Chapter 3: The Streets of Mos Espa,\" the third episode of the television series The Book of Boba Fett, which was released on Disney+ on January 12, 2022. He was identified in the credits and played by Jordan Bolger, while Ladell Preston served as a stunt double for the character.",
