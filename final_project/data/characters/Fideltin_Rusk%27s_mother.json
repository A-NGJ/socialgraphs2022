 "content": "The mother of the Galactic Republic soldier Fideltin Rusk was a Chagrian female who lived in a colony on the planet Mindor during the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A strong pacifist like many of her species, the woman married a Chagrian male, and the two had a son they named Fideltin 3680 BBY.\nHowever, Rusk rebelled against the colony's pacifist ideals and enlisted in the Republic Military as soon as he was of age, and did not return to the colony throughout the Great Galactic War and the subsequent Cold War. In 3650 BBY, the Sith Empire attacked the colony during an incursion into Republic space, and his mother and father were both killed along with the rest of the colony. In the aftermath of the attack, Rusk's superiors began receiving reports that he became increasingly reckless in battle.\nThe mother of Fideltin Rusk, a companion character for the Jedi Knight class in the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, was first mentioned in the Holonet section of the game's official site.",
