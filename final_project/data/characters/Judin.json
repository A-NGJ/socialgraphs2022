 "content": "Judin was a Human male who served in the navy during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. By the year 3643 BBY, Judin had risen to the rank of Flight Commander, and he was in charge of recruitment for the elite Coruscant Aegis Squadron, a group of Republic-allied individuals who would strike at far-flung Imperial targets and complete missions too covert, specialized, or delicate for normal Republic forces.\nIn 3643 BBY, Judin contacted The Barsen'thor, the Hero of Tython, the Voidhound, and the Havoc Squad commander and recruited them into the elite fighter squadron called the Coruscant Aegis.\nJudin was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He contacts Republic players on board their ship by holocomm, just after they complete their Coruscant storylines and receive their own ship. He recruits the player into the Coruscant Aegis Squadron, which serves as the plotline for the space missions available to the players.",
