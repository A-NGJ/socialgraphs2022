 "content": "Donari Caron was a female Zeltron smuggler who was affiliated with the Black Sun criminal organization, and she operated from the starship Touch of Gold. In about 18 BBY, Caron met with the Human black market trader Acer Ash on the planet Coruscant, to broker an agreement with him to swap some archaeological artifacts that she had recently acquired for some experimental energy shields that he possessed. During the course of their negotiations, Caron repeatedly attempted to use her pheromones to influence Ash, and he revealed to her that he knew of an attempt on the life of Emperor Palpatine that was scheduled to take place. Caron and Ash eventually agreed to exchange an energy shield one of her paintings, and she subsequently passed on intelligence of the impending assassination attempt to the Black Sun lieutenant Tyno Fabris.",
