 "content": "Jiik was a male Human resident of Coruscant and the brother of Juul. In 3643 BBY he and his sister worked for the Darmas Pollaran's network as informants. While trailing the criminal Skavak through Justicar territory, he and his sister were separated. Jiik witnessed members of the Justicars' Brigade meet with an envoy from the reconstituted Sith Empire and was arrested and locked in the Justicars' Tower. His sister hired Corso Riggs and the Voidhound to spring him out, which they accomplished.\nIn the year 3643 BBY, Jiik and his sister lived on the Galactic Republic's capital of Coruscant and were members of the informant network of gambler Darmas Pollaran. Polloran had them trail the notorious criminal Skavak, and while following him through the territory of the paramillitary law enforcement group known as the Justicars' Brigade, he and his sister were separated. Jiik continued to trail Skavak and saw him head into the Workds with personnel of the reconstituted Sith Empire. However, he also witnessed members of the Justicars meet with another group of Imperials, who were secretly backing them to further destabilize the Republic. To keep him from revealing the source of their supplies and money, the Justicars imprisoned him in Justicars' Tower.\nJuul, meanwhile, met with the gunman Corso Riggs and the smuggler who would later be known as the Voidhound, two outlaws who were tracking down Skavak to settle their vendettas with him. She informed them that her brother knew where Skavak had gone, but was imprisoned by the Justicars. The duo freed Jiik, who relayed Skavak's location and explained why he was captured. Juul, over holocomm, talked to her brother and he decided he would lay low for a while. Using Jiik's information, Corso and the Voidhound followed Skavak into the Works.\nJiik had green eyes, closely-shaved dark hair, and fair skin.\nHe was able to track Skavak well, and managed to keep following him after separated from his sister. He quickly recognized that the Voidhound was not a Justicar, and believed the best solution to his trouble with the brigade was to lie low.\nJiik first appears in the 2011 online video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as a character in the Coruscant portion of the Smuggler story. Rescuing him is the objective of the mission \"Due Process\".",
