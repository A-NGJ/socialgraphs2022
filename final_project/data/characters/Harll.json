 "content": "Harll was a male Farghul bounty hunter and a member of the Crimson Nova.\nHarll was a fierce warrior who often preferred to fight rather than think. Because of his warrior nature, he managed to obtain a sword with a cortosis alloy blade as a gift from a Morgukai warrior.\nEventually, he became romantically associated with the Farghul, Mika, and joined her chapter of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. This chapter stood out from others for their willingness to accept a contracts on Jedi bounties; this eventually attracted the attention of the Jedi High Council who sent four Jedi Masters to deal with the Chapter. When these Masters arrived, Harll used his cortosis sword to fight Mace Windu in a duel that would ultimately lead to Harll's death.\nThe Jedi soon overtook the bounty hunter's headquarters and forced the contract to be canceled.\nWhen Harll's name is first spoken in Show of Force, it is misspelled \"Harrll\".",
