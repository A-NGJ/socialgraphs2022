 "content": "Jeswi Ele was a female Human Jedi Initiate enrolled in the Jedi Order's Temple academy on Coruscant during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Jeswi Ele was given to the Jedi Order for education in the ways of the Force. Sorted into a clan at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Initiate Ele remained at the Temple as many of her instructors fought and died during the Clone Wars.\nWhen Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order in 19 BBY by issuing Contingency Order 66, Initiate Ele was present with her clan at the Temple when the 501st Legion marched up the Processional Way. Seeking refuge in the High Council Chamber high atop one of the Temple's towers, she and her peers were pleased when Jedi Anakin Skywalker walked into the chamber. Believing the famed hero was there to save them from the attacking clones, the children were caught unawares when the Jedi-turned-Sith ignited his lightsaber and slew the younglings. Indeed, Skywalker had fallen to the dark side of the Force and was now known as Darth Vader.\nLeland Chee revealed on the StarWars.com Message Boards that Jeswi Ele was the tentative name of one of the younglings shown on screen taking refuge from the invading Clone troopers. Ele later got an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia and the Databank.",
