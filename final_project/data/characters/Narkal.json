 "content": "Narkal was a bull Gamorrean hunter dwelling in Anchorhead on Tatooine during the Jedi Civil War. Narkal was noted for his talkativeness, which wound up fellow hunters Ugzak and Gurke. Both of the other Gamorreans thought of Narkal as stupid, and frequently told him to shut up. The three Gamorreans ambushed Revan in the wastes and were possibly killed by Revan.\nRevan also had an opportunity to kill him and his group in the lodge. They could also be bribed not to kill Revan. If they are not talked to after the ambush, in the lodge, he will not die.",
