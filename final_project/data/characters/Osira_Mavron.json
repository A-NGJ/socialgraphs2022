 "content": "Osira Mavron was a Human female who served in the Imperial Army until she defected to the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring the Battle of Praadost II, Mavron was decorated repeatedly for conspicuous bravery, participating in numerous operations. In the final days of the campaign, Osira Mavron stumbled upon the secret that the Rebels were fighting so hard to hide. A small refugee camp was located in an underground cavern she was scouting. Confronted with hundreds of refugees and orphans, Mavron realized what she had been supporting and defected to the Rebel Alliance.",
