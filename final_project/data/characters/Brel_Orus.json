 "content": "Brel Orus was a male Human who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nDuring the Cold War, Brel Orus, a corporate manager, joined the Balmorran resistance with thousands of Balmorrans that planned to defend their planet from the Empire's brutal conquest for power and slavery. When the other corporate leaders refused to give up their life's work to the invaders, Orus betrayed the resistance and joined the new Imperial regime. He oversaw the confiscation and storage of Balmorran corporate technologies from the comfort of the Empire's headquarters in Sobrik. He believed that he was safe from his fellow Balmorrans and felt unnoticed by his Imperial overlords.\nIn 3642 BBY, the first year of the renewed conflict, Brel and his fellow Sith troopers held Tanno Vik hostage after his betrayal. He later encountered the captain of Havoc Squad who was there to rescue the Bounty hunter and negotiate peacefully. Brel refused to surrender and ordered his guards to kill the soldier. After the captain defeated the guards, Brell immediately surrendered and was willing to make a deal by giving credits to the lieutenant and the Republic's heroism. The lieutenant refused his offer and ordered him to leave. Brel thanked the lieutenant and felt that joining the Empire was a big mistake.",
