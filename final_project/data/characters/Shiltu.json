 "content": "Shiltu was a male Hutt who worked for the Black Sun crime syndicate during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. In the syndicate, he held the rank of vigo, or lieutenant. Sometime before the start of the Clone Wars, he double-crossed Tarnese Lyanne, a Sakiyan who had invested much in black market and smuggling operations; the betrayal resulted in the ruination of Lyanne's clan. In 30 BBY, Shiltu died from a massive cellular hemorrhage, a sort of full-body stroke that ended the Hutt's life far too quickly and painlessly, in the opinion of Tarnese Bleyd, a descendant of Lyanne.\nShiltu was first mentioned in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, a novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry which was published in 2004.",
