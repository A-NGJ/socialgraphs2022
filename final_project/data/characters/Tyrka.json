 "content": "Tyrka was a female Human member of Eco-strike, a eco-terrorist group active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. She and her friend Momi Andrell worked to save the shanjaru, a race of non-sentient creatures that were driven to near extinction. As Drooga the Hutt planned on eating the male Shanjaru, Tyrka was willing to put up a fight and change the galaxy together. She later encountered Voidhound, a smuggler who was hired by Drooga and Ga'ram to stop Momi and prevent her from recovering the genetic samples from the female shanjaru. The smuggler convinced Tyrka that it was all a huge misunderstanding and was here to help. Tyrka agreed and gave the smuggler a data pad which would find Doctor Lazhae and left.",
