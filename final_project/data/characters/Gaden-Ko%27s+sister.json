 "content": "Gaden-Ko's sister was a female Voss sister of a Voss Mystic-in-training Gaden-Ko. Around 3640 BBY she accompanied Gaden-Ko on his pilgrimage along with their parents, cousins and grandfather Dajan-Ko. Unfortunately, they were attacked and the entire family was killed, leading Gaden-Ko as the only survivor. At his final trial in the Dark Heart Gaden-Ko was tempted the possibility of his sister's return before becoming a Mystic.\nGaden-Ko's sister is mentioned briefly in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Consular class mission on Voss.",
