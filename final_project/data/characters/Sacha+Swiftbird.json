 "content": "Sacha Swiftbird was a Force-sensitive female Human who made a career for herself as a podracer pilot during the Republic Classic era.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, she became a member of the Antarian Rangers, a Jedi-affiliated paramilitary group, and following the rise of the Galactic Empire, she became part of the Rangers' attempts to oppose the new regime. Swiftbird became based in Mountain Home, an underground facility that the Rangers operated on the planet Toprawa.\nIn 18 BBY, she involved herself in an attempt by the Jedi Knight Jax Pavan to rescue the Cerean Thi Xon Yimmon—the leader of the Whiplash resistance group—from the clutches of the Empire, following Yimmon's capture by the Sith Lord Darth Vader. After Pavan went missing, Swiftbird and Pavan's associates Den Dhur and I-5YQ staged their own attempt to free Yimmon, and they journeyed to Kantaros Station, the facility on which Yimmon was being held, and infiltrated the space station by posing as members of the criminal organization Black Sun. After joining forces with Pavan, who had launched his own rescue mission independently, Swiftbird slew the Imperial Inquisitor Probus Tesla with a lightsaber while Tesla was engaged in a duel with Pavan. Swiftbird and her compatriots then freed Yimmon and left aboard their starship for the world Dathomir, where Pavan had business with the planet's witches.",
