 "content": "Yperio Baobab was a male Human from Manda. A droid programmer by trade, he was considered to be the father of modern-day droidspeak by New Republic standards.\nA member of the prestigious merchant fleet-owning Baobab family, Yperio was a cyberphilologist who lived around 200 BBY. During his lifetime, he greatly expanded upon existing electronic code-based droid languages such as CBell-1, with the outcome being the ability for the automatons to recall and pass on many different types of sensory-gathered data to other droids and computers. The resulting language was referred to as Bab-Prime.",
