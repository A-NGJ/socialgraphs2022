 "content": "Torim was a Human merchant who lived on the planet Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. A light skinned Human female with black hair and brown eyes, she was one of many of his species who settled on Taris. A fluent speaker of Basic, Torim wore light armor for protection from the world's wildlife. She sold light armor from her shop in Olaris, the headquarters of the Republic-sponsored Taris Resettlement Initiative.\nTorim appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Light Armor Vendor for Republic players on Taris. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Torim was removed from the game along with the rest of the Light Armor Vendors.",
