 "content": "Regmus was a male Nothoiin who served the Noble Court-in-exile of the Anoat sector. Once the captain of the Throneship Honorbound, he had lost it to the Galactic Empire by the time of the Iron Blockade, and sought to atone for his failure.\nEventually, Regmus joined the Smuggler's crew, who dispatched the captain on a variety of missions throughout the Anoat sector.\nRegmus was created for the canon mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam for iOS and Android platforms and released in 2015, where he is a unique 3 star crew member. This article assumes 100% game completion of Star Wars: Uprising, which means the Smuggler acquired Regmus as a member of their crew and dispatched him on Crew Runs.\nDue to having the \"Studious\" skill, Regmus is strong on XP Finder Runs.",
