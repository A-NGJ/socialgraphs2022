 "content": "Foreman Chivos was employed by Mensix Corp to oversee the Mensix Mining Facility on Mustafar during the Galactic Civil War.\nOne of his several responsibilities was to ensure the mining crews received their appropriate supplies. On one occasion where supply droids were failing to deliver their shipments, Chivos resorted to employing random spacers to do the job.\nChivos was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
