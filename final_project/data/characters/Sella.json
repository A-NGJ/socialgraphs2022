 "content": "Sella was a female Twi'lek bartender who worked at a cantina on the Rooted Moon of Hetzal Prime during the High Republic Era. She had scarlet skin and wore intricate lacings on her lekku that she had designed herself. Mirialan scantech Merven Getter was attracted to her, and on the day of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Getter intended to ask Sella out when he returned to the inner Hetzal system after work. However, the Hetzal system monitoring station where Getter worked was destroyed in the disaster, killing him, so he never got the chance.",
