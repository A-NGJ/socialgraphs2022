 "content": "Dorwin Corvax, also known as the Black Bishop, was a human male individual who was the husband of Lady Corvax. At some point, he fell in battle, and Lady Corvax attempted to use the Bright Star to bring him back to life but instead turned Mustafar into a hellish wasteland, leaving her husband caught between the real world and what came after. Due to his situation, Lord Corvax had the ability to both suspend time and teleport. At some point during the Imperial Era, he helped Darth Vader in his quest to bring Padm√© Amidala back to life, though his true intentions were to retrieve the Bright Star from Vader and return it to the native Mustafarians, freeing himself from his curse.\nHis descendant assisted in returning the Bright Star to the Mustafarians.\nDorwin Corvax first appeared in the first chapter of Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series, a three-part virtual reality series created by ILMxLAB. Named the Black Bishop in certain portions of the game, he is referred by the Priestess in a flashback cutscene as \"Sir Dorwin.\" Lucasfilm Story Group member Matt Martin later clarified the spelling of this name on Twitter.",
