 "content": "The father of Cassian Jeron Andor was a human male. During the Clone Wars, Andor's father was killed at the Carida Academy during a protest against the increasing militarization of the Galactic Republic, while Andor was still young.\nCassian Jeron Andor's father was first mentioned in the 2016 book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide. The television series Andor later established that Clem Andor, who died on the planet Ferrix, was Cassian's adoptive father. As this is different from his fate on Carida, established in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, the two must be distinct individuals.",
