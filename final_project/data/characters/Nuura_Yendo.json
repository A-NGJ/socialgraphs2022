 "content": "Nuura Yendo was a female Nautolan chef living on Mek-Sha in 3626 BBY. During the Feast of Prosperity, her services were sought by the Hutt Duuba the Magnanimous.\nIn 3626 BBY, Nuura Yendo was approached by advocates for the Feast of Prosperity after saving her from the slaver faction known as The Brothers. She was asked by the advocates to become a cook for the Feast and to head to Nar Shaddaa.\nUpon being rescued from the Brothers, Nuura can be asked by the player character to come work as a cook for the feast. At first she will be concerned that she's still in danger, and ask to stay on Mek-Sha. The player character can either persuade her that she'll be safer with Duuba, or threaten her to go. Either way, she will head to Nar Shaddaa and go to work as a chef for the Feast.",
