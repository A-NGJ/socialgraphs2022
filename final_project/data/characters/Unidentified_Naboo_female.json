 "content": "An unidentified Naboo female lived on Void Station, working as a servant for a Bothan information broker named Jib Kopatha, during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0 ABY, Darth Vader arrived to Void Station, planning to extract information from Kopatha. After a short battle between two of the Bothan's guards and Vader, Kopatha tried to calm the Sith Lord down by offering him various off-world \"delicacies\", such as food, beverages and women.\nAmong them was a young Naboo female, offering Vader blossom wine. He stared at her for a few seconds, which prompted the young woman to ask him if something was wrong. Vader bluntly answered her \"no\" and quickly turned away, as the woman presumably reminded him of his late wife, Padm√© Amidala.",
