 "content": "Murthil was a Selonian female living on Corellia during the Galactic War. She was known as a vicious warrior, and came to be the den mother of Selonians who lived inside the Selonian Tunnel Network under Corellia's capital, Coronet City.\nWhen the Sith Empire invaded Corellia, den mother Murthil, along with her den's many Selonians, aided the Corellian rebels in their battle against the Imperials. After the Empire bombed several factories in the Labor Valley, Murthil led a group of rebel Selonians when the Empire placed a bounty on them in an effort to cull the aliens' numbers. Afterwards, the Selonians traveled to a tunnel network underneath Coronet City where they faced an Imperial hero who had followed them. Murthil and her troops including Destha battled the Imperials, but were all defeated. By the time General Hesker and his men entered the scene, Murthil was the only one left alive and pleading to spare her in exchange for joining the Empire.\nMurthil is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game. Depending on the choices the player' make, Murthil is either sworn to serve the Empire  or is executed along with the rest of her species .",
