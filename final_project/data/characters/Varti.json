 "content": "Varti was a Human male criminal who was a citizen of Athar on the planet JanFathal during the Clone Wars.\nIn 22 BBY, he worked alongside with Merish Hath and Shil Kaval when they later were accompanied by Orla Taman, who was revealed to be Hallena Devis, an undercover Republic agent. He later participated, along with the local rebels, in an uprising against the Republic-aligned Regent of the planet. When Devis's position as a spy was revealed, he, along with Merish and Shil took her hostage. When the Republic strike team arrived to rescue Devis, he was shot by CT-7567 at point blank range.",
