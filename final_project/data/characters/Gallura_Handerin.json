 "content": "Gallura Handerin was a Human female who lived on the planet Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. She was high-ranking employee of the Corellian government.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Gallura Handerin worked in the Capitol building of Coronet City as a high level government aide. She had a cousin who lived on the outskirts of Coronet, the farmer Pol Handerin.\nIn 1 ABY, Gallura Handerin recruited a spacer who previously worked with Pol Handerin to fulfill several missions. She first requested the spacer to check all the government drop boxes in Coronet City. She then asked the spacer to recover a stormtrooper armor stolen from an Imperial officer in the Capitol. She was very satisfied when the spacer brought back the armor even before the officer could notice the robbery. Eventually, Handerin tasked the spacer to find a missing government courier. However, the courier was assassinated by the criminal Preens B'oola in order to steal the government documents that the courier was carrying. B'oola asked for a huge ransom of 1,000,000 credits but the spacer killed him and recovered the documents. For all those services, Gallura Handerin then recommended the spacer to Brantlee Spondoon, the aide to the Diktat.\nGallura Handerin was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nGallura Handerin was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. She was part of the questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
