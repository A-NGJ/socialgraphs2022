 "content": "Nond Kendo was a Human male lieutenant who served in the Imperial Navy as a TIE pilot onboard the first Death Star. He was killed in a training accident prior to the Battle of Yavin.\nDuring the construction of the Death Star at Despayre, Kendo was participating in a training exercise for new recruits under the command of Villian Dance. Rather than follow the training parameters as issued by Dance, Kendo deliberately flew too close to one of the training drones and was tagged by its low-powered defensive beams. Startled by this, he clipped the drone and was killed in the resulting explosion.",
