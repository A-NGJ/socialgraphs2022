 "content": "Kerlo was a criminal employed by Shoto Eyefire, a Defel crime boss who controlled Horn Station. He was a thug and professional gunman, and usually got into fights because of his brute temper.\nOne day, Kerlo demanded money from a man he took to be an itinerant miner, and challenged him to a showdown with blasters when he refused to pay up. The miner was in fact an undercover Jedi Knight, who made short work of him, taking the thug down with a blast before Kerlo's blaster had even cleared its holster.\nKerlo survived the incident, which was promptly reported to Eyefire. His defeat piqued Eyefire's interest, prompting him to challenge the newcomer himself, a decision which ultimately led to his downfall.",
