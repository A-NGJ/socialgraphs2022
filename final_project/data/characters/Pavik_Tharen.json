 "content": "Pavik Tharen was the brother of Bria Tharen and son of Sera Tharen and Renn Tharen. When Bria returned to Corellia with Han Solo after escaping Ylesia, Pavik and Sera were disgusted by Bria's companion. With the arrival of the authorities investigating Solo—who had a death mark on his head from Teroenza—Bria and her brother had a falling out and never met or spoke again.\nIt was Pavik who first suspected that Han was involved in illegal activity, especially after Dael Levare called Han by an alias upon first meeting the young man. Pavik then recognized Han from another scam of Garris Shrike's, and contacted CorSec against his father's, and Bria's, wishes.",
