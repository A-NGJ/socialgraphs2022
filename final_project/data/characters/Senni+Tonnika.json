 "content": "Senni Tonnika was a woman who, along with her sister Brea, formed the Tonnika sisters, a duo of con artists. At some point, Senni and Brea helped an associate break out of prison.\nSenni and Brea eventually came to meet Lando Calrissian and trashed their appartment on Coruscant to be on the Millennium Falcon. They also met Han Solo, however he later betrayed and humiliated the sisters, ending their partnership.\nBy 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Tonnika and her sister were living on Tatooine, but when Jabba put a bounty on Solo, they went to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, a drinking establishment located in Mos Eisley. They decided not to collect Jabba's bounty, but to steal the Millennium Falcon so they could leave the planet, overhearing the ship was In Docking Bay 94. When they got to the bay they quickly had to hide as Jabba was there as well. They snuck out of the docking bay, and decided to steal another ship.\nSenni Tonnika had black hair, green eyes, and fair skin. Similar to that of her sister, she wore her hair in many braids. She and her sister wore similar catsuits.\nSenni was played by Angela Staines and Brea was played by actress Christine Hewett. Christine and Angela were real life friends and were known during production as \"Space Girls\".",
