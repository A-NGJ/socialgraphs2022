 "content": "Egara was a Human female bounty hunter who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, she along with Riloh and Scorch worked for Rogun the Butcher. They were hired to search for Skavak and Ace for stealing Rogun's shipment of blasters. However, they were unaware that Skavak had betrayed the smuggler, who was after his neck as well as well. The trio found the smuggler in the Dealer's Den cantina on Coruscant, but were convinced to back down and leave.",
