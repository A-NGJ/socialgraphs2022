 "content": "Monn Tatth was a dark-skinned human male who spent time on the planet Jakku around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. On Jakku, he was stood near Venalo Wintz and the droid KT-310 when he witnessed the scavenger Rey knocking the First Order deserter Finn after chasing him through Niima Outpost with the astromech droid BB-8 who had accused Finn of being a thief. The First Order attacked Niima in search of BB-8 shortly after the incident. While on Jakku, Tatth wore a black piece of headwear and white robes.\nMonn Tatth first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The actor playing the character was uncredited and the character did not receive a name in the film, but was identified by the video game LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was released in conjunction with the film. Despite the game being non-canon, story group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed on Twitter that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including Tatth, were considered canon.",
