 "content": "Everson was a human male servant of the Tech Masters, the three rulers of the junk planet Trionak. When Luke Skywalker was captured while attempt to retrieve the stolen Rebel Alliance transport Nema from Trionak, the Tech Masters ordered Everson to execute him with a firing squad of commando droids. Skywalker attempted to use a mind trick to force Everson to free him, which was successful, but the droids continued to follow their orders regardless. Everson, under the influence of the mind trick, attempted to stop the droids from firing, but one of the droids pushed him away, knocking him unconscious against a wall.",
