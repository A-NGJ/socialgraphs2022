 "content": "Brok was a Human male guard lieutenant in the security forces of Belsavis prison, a Galactic Republic prison facility on the planet Belsavis. During the invasion of Belsavis by the Sith Empire, he became determined to ensure that a criminal named Gouge did not escape from the nearby labor camps, and three members of the disgraced Dagger Wing—Ty, Symo, and Lin—volunteered to help him. The group found Gouge, but were pinned down until they were rescued by Havoc Squad, which helped them evacuate the prisoner to a more secure location.\nBrok appears in the Trooper class mission \"Overwhelming Force\" on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011.",
