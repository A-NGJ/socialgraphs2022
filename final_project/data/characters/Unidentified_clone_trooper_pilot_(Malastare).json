 "content": "This clone trooper pilot was present at the Battle of Malastare, one of the most grueling battles of the Clone Wars. During this battle, the Republic dropped an electro-proton bomb, the force of which formed a sinkhole. After the electromagnetic pulse wave dissipated, the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer  this trooper was piloting fell into the hole, along with several others. He survived the fall but was badly injured. He was later recovered by a rescue party led by Jedi General Mace Windu. As Windu knelt beside him, the clone informed the general that something other than Separatists was down there.\nCloned on the water world of Kamino from the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, this pilot served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nIn the Battle of Malastare, he served under Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu, commanding an AT-TE Tank against the approaching droid army. Halfway through the battle, the leader of the Dugs, Nakha Urus, authorized dropping an electro-proton bomb on the droid army. The bomb created a massive crater, into which this clone and his AT-TE fell. Upon being found by General Windu and his rescue team, this trooper revealed that something else was down there with them.\nLike his genetic progenitor, Jango Fett, this clone stood at 1.83 meters.\nAs with all the clone troopers in The Clone Wars television series, this clone was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.",
