 "content": "Feylis Ardele was a Human female pilot who served in the New Republic Defense Force during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe Human female Feylis Ardele was a veteran of the Commenor Militia and a cadet in the New Republic Defense Force in the months after the Battle of Endor. Around seven months after that conflict, she was recruited into Rogue Squadron on the advice of Firstpilot Rekush, a trusted aide of the New Republic's Admiral Ackbar. As a skilled TIE fighter pilot, Ardele interested Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles as someone who could take on the Rogues in daily simulations, and who could also enlighten them about recent advancements in the TIE Series.\nThe Commenor Militia had exclusively trained with TIE fighters in order to prepare its graduates for the Imperial Naval Academy, but as Ardele had no love for the Empire, she never enlisted. Nonetheless, her TIE experience and the militia's relationship with the Empire made her nervous around her new squadron mates when she joined Rogue Squadron, but Rogue veteran Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian reassured her that several of them were Imperial-trained and that none of them held her experience against her. He also expressed admiration that she had nearly bested him during a simulator run, a simulation in which she destroyed the X-wing fighter of fellow Rogue vet Wes Janson.\nArdele's family was executed by the Empire under suspect of being rebels. She soon fell in love with fellow Rogue Avan Beruss, but they hid their relationship from public knowledge. Ardele's campaigns as a Rogue included the Eiattu Campaign, the Battle of Malrev IV, the Battle of Brentaal IV, and the Evacuation of Ciutric.",
