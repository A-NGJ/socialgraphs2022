However, he was unable to cope with his employers' allegiance to the Galactic Empire, so he joined the Rebel Alliance, rising to the rank of commander. When the Alliance needed a competent commanding officer for an outpost on located in the caverns of the Mount Deldarca volcano, Dalgeer volunteered for the assignment. The base eventually became known as Dalgeer's Rim.\nDalgeer was energetic and outspoken. He was very willing to tell people his opinions on everything.",
