 "content": "Risi Lenoan was a female Human Senator who represented Kuat and the Kuat sector in the Galactic Senate during the waning years of the Republic.\nIn 22 BBY, Lenoan was present at the unveiling ceremony of the Aethersprite-class interceptor at the Kuat Drive Yards, where she symbolically cut a tether tied to the prototype's landing gear. During the test run, she lauded its performance, alongside Jedi Knights Aayla Secura and Adi Gallia and the project's Lead Engineer, Walex Blissex.\nShe was removed from office by the Kuati nobility when it was discovered she might have pilfered Kuat Drive Yards funding. Lenoan was replaced by Giddean Danu at the suggestion of Onara Kuat.",
