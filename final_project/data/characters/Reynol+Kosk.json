 "content": "Reynol Kosk was a male Human who served in the Imperial Army.\nThe Human male Reynol Kosk was an Imperial Army soldier who rose to the rank of lieutenant by 9 ABY. An acknowledged expert on the PLX-2M portable missile launcher, he commanded the Imperial garrison on the planet Trogan. In 9 ABY, Kosk was bribed by Niles Ferrier to attack what became the first meeting of the Smugglers' Alliance, even after having been specifically ordered by Grand Admiral Thrawn to leave the group alone. Kosk and the majority of his force were subsequently killed after a brief firefight with the gathered smugglers and mercenaries.\nMotivated by wealth and power, Kosk was the type of soldier that Grand Admiral Thrawn saw as a liability to his plans and wanted to remove from the Empire.\nKosk was trained to use a blaster and grenades, and could pilot repulsorlift vehicles.\nLieutenant Kosk wore a stand Imperial Army uniform, and was armed with a blaster pistol. He also carried a comlink, datapad, and survival pack.",
