 "content": "A guard was a member of Death Watch around 20 BBY.\nAfter Pre Vizsla, Bo-Katan, and other Death Watch members found Darth Maul and Savage Opress floating in the space, they took them to their camp on Zanbar. The guard escorted Maul to the tent of Vizsla after he had received his new legs. Later, when the newly formed Shadow Collective went to Nal Hutta in order to gain the support of the Hutts, the guard took part in the skirmish, and he was the one to report to Vizsla and Maul that all the Hutts escaped except Oruba who was soon executed.\nThe guard was voiced by Corey Burton, who also provided the voice of Count Dooku in the series.",
