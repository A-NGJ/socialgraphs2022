 "content": "Silvasu Fi was a member of the Cloud-Riders during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 10 BBY, Fi and the other members of the group traveled to the planet Savareen in order to try and take possession of a shipment of coaxium fuel. The fuel was being refined by a crew of outlaws associated with the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate who the Cloud-Riders confronted outside of a cantina. Fi and the others stood by as their leader Enfys Nest attempted to persuade the outlaws to side with them against Crimson Dawn. Her words swayed the outlaw Han Solo who came up with a plan to kill Dryden Vos, the leader of Crimson Dawn, and keep the coaxium.\nSolo and his companions boarded the crime lord's yacht with the coaxium while Fi and the Cloud-Riders set up an ambush using local villagers as decoys. Having been led to believe that Nest and her allies had the coaxium, Vos sent out all of the mercenaries under his control to reclaim it; however, they fell for the decoys and were successfully defeated by Nest, Fi and the other Cloud-Riders. Solo and his allies then killed Vos and returned the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders.\nSilvasu Fi was a an alien form a world devastated by one of the Five Crime Syndicates who became a member of the Cloud-Riders during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 10 BBY, the organization was led by the human female Enfys Nest, who led a small group of Cloud-Riders to the planet Vandor to try and steal coaxium fuel from the Empire, but was thwarted by a crew of criminals led by Tobias Beckett and associated with Crimson Dawn. Nest then had her people tail Beckett's crew, and Fi and fellow Cloud-Rider Weazel followed them to the drink establishment known as the Lodge on Vandor.\nThere, Fi lent against a column with a drink as Beckett's associates Han Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca passed by in search of the pilot Lando Calrissian. Solo and Calrissian ended up playing sabacc together in one of the establishment's back rooms, and both Fi and Weazel joined the growing crowd watching the game. Fi witnessed the final round of the game, in which Calrissian bet his ship, the Millennium Falcon, against a fictitious VCX-100 light freighter that Solo claimed to own. When Solo revealed a hand of straight staves, Fi clapped, but when Calrissian revealed Full Sabacc and won, Fi jumped up and down excitedly while applauding.\nCalrissian then joined up with Beckett's crew and they left together in the Falcon, which Weazel had placed a homing beacon upon. After learning that Beckett's crew had successfully stolen another shipment of coaxium from the planet Kessel, Nest led the Cloud-Riders, including Fi to the planet Savareen, where Beckett was trying to have the fuel refined at the Bis Refinery.\nAfter the refinement process had begun, Fi and the other Cloud-Riders confronted Beckett and his allies outside of a cantina in a village near the refinery. Nest stood lined up with Fi and eleven others, all of whom had their blasters aimed at Beckett's crew. They listened to the outlaw Han Solo bluff that he and Beckett had thirty mercenaries waiting in their YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon; however, the ruse was spoiled by the fact that the Falcon took off and left Savareen as Solo finished his false threat. Nest then removed her mask and ordered the Cloud-Riders to bring Beckett's crew inside the cantina.\nIn the cantina, Fi stood by as Nest tried to convince Beckett and his crew that Crimson Dawn was evil and that they should not hand over the coaxium the syndicate. When Nest revealed that the syndicates had brutalised Fi and the other Cloud-Riders' homeworlds, the whole group removed their helmets together. The speech was enough to convince Solo to try and aid them, and he came up with a plan to work with the Cloud-Riders and kill the leader of Crimson Dawn, the crime lord Dryden Vos. Suspecting that Beckett would not be willing to side with the Cloud-Riders, Solo fed him a false plan in which they would give Vos fake coaxium. After hearing this, Beckett abandoned them as expected.\nWith Beckett gone, Fi and the rest of the Cloud-Riders gave their helmets to inhabitants of the local village so that the natives could act as decoys as part of Solo's plan. Solo and the remaining members of Beckett's crew then took the freshly refined coaxium to Vos's yacht, the First Light, which had landed nearby. As expected Beckett betrayed his former allies and informed Vos what he knew of the plan, causing the crime lord to send all of the mercenaries he had on his yacht to track down Nest and the other Cloud-Riders, who he believed had the coaxium.\nThe mercenaries quickly located the disguised villagers and surrounded them, believing they had captured Fi and the other Cloud-Riders. In reality, Fi and the others were hidden in the surrounding village and ambushed the mercenaries after their leader Aemon Gremm discovered that the cases he assumed contained the stolen coaxium were empty. Fi was amongst a group of the Cloud-Riders who fired down upon the mercenaries from a raised walkway. Gremm and his men were quickly subdued, leaving Vos vulnerable back on his yacht.\nSolo and his allies then killed both Vos and Beckett, before returning with the coaxium to Nest, Fi and the other Cloud-Riders. The group loaded the fuel up onto their speeder bikes, then mounted up themselves. Waiting for Nest to launch first, the group then took off and left the village behind, traveling to a rendezvous with the leader of the Partisans rebel movement, Saw Gerrera. Nest then gave the coaxium to Gerrera to aid in his fight against the Empire.\nFi had black eyes and gray skin. The alien was surprised when Solo returned with the coaxium after killing Vos, having assumed he would flee with the valuable fuel.\nFi wore a light brown jacket with dark brown pants and a white bandolier and boots. The Cloud-Rider wore a white helmet with red stripes and used both a short spear-like weapon and a blaster rifle in combat.\nSilvasu Fi was portrayed by Stephanie Silva in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was later identified in the Star Wars: Card Trader app. The character's name is partially based on the actress' name.",
