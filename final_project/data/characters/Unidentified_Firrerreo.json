 "content": "A male Firrerreo was forced to watch the destruction of his homeworld and then held captive aboard one of Procurator of Justice Hethrir's passenger freighters.\nWhen Leia Organa Solo happened upon the freighter while searching for her three missing children in 14 ABY, she freed the man from his pod, only to be met with open hostility. The Firrereo refused to help her and Chewbacca free Rillao from her torture web, saying that he cared not for anything but his people, but help them free Rillao anyway. When finally the pair left the ship in pursuit of Lord Hethrir, he flatly refused to leave the ship.",
