 "content": "Paolen was a male Sith pureblood who served as a Sith Lord of the Sith Empire during the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. At various times, he was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock and at the contested moon CZ-198.\nLord Paolen was originally present in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as the Campaign and Black Hole Vendor for the Sith Inquisitor class. However, when the PvP gear system was reworked in later updates, Paolen was removed along with the other Campaign and Black Hole Vendors. It was not until around the time of Game Update 2.0 that Paolen was added back to the game, this time as a Level 55 Basic Gear Vendor for the Inquisitor class in CZ-198. Paolen and the rest of the class gear vendors at CZ-198, along with all other Daily Areas and high-level planets, were replaced by a single standardized vendor in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; Paolen was replaced by Lord Turbis.",
