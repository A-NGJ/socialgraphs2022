 "content": "Isen was a Human male captain of the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nDuring the Cold War with the Galactic Republic, Isen was sent on a mission to investigate an unusual behavior among the droids at a construction site. While investigating, he was suddenly attacked by one of the droids. He barely escaped with his life until he found a transmitter that was on one of the droids. After returning to Kaas City, he encountered an Imperial-aligned individual and explained him the situation. He then sent the individual to deal with the problem and remove the transmitters off the droids.",
