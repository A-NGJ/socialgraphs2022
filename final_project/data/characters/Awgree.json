 "content": "Awgree was the pet sheffi of Gatha Elbaphay, a patron of Canto Casino in Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. In 34 ABY, the sheffi was present along with its owner when Resistance soldiers Finn and Rose Tico went to the Canto Casino in search of the Master Codebreaker.\nAwgree appeared in the 2017 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. The creature was an animatronic prop inspired by Carrie Fisher's dog Gary, and was known as Gary or Space Gary on set. It was remotely operated by Daisy Beattie and permanantly attached to the arm of the Gatha Elbaphay costume worn by creature and droid performer Paul Warren, who Beattie communicated with via earpiece. In 2021, Lucasfilm Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo revealed that the sheffi's assigned name was Awgree, which was derived from the word Gary.",
