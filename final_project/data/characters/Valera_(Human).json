 "content": "Valera was a female Human computer specialist who was a member of the Gray Griffins, a scouting team that served the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. After the Alliance made a deal with the Radell Mining Corporation, Valera and the Griffins were sent to perform some exploration work for RMC and they discovered the planet Alluuvia in the Elrood sector. However, the Grffins' 3-Z light freighter Whisper was attacked by The Scourge, a band of pirates that operated in the region, and Valera and the other Gray Griffins were captured. The scouting team were imprisoned in The Scourge's base on the planet Dega and they became malnourished as a result of their treatment. However, they were eventually rescued by a group of Alliance agents, and Valera and her compatriots were subsequently transported to the planet Elrood to receive medical treatment.",
