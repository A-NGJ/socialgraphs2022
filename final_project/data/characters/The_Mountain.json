 "content": "The Mountain were five exceedingly tall Kadas'sa'Nikto brothers who lived on Nar Shaddaa during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Members of the Morgukai cult, the brothers overthrew Bareesh the Hutt and took his place as the leaders of the Kintan Kings crime gang on Nar Shaddaa.\nDuring the Cold War, the Mountain led the Kintan Kings in attacks on Republic interests on Nar Shaddaa. In response, the Republic enlisted the aid of a sympathetic Republic allied individual to retaliate against the Kings. When the individual became enough of a nuisance, a member of the Mountain contacted them, demanding that they come face the Mountain or they would blow up the spaceport Bareesh was lending to the Republic. When faced with their foe, the Mountain collectively revealed themselves, as well as Bareesh's former position as leader of the gang. They claimed that Bareesh was only helping the Republic to exact revenge against them and the individual was only a puppet. They then attacked them, but were all killed.",
