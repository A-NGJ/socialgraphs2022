 "content": "Tk-216 was a Human male stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nTk-216 was a stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire from the planet Gala. After the Battle of Yavin, he was stationed near an Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the remote planet Dathomir. There, the Empire was conducting secret and dangerous scientific research, intending to engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus in order to create super soldiers. In 1 ABY, an accident happened at the Imperial Research Facility and resulted in the virus outbreak. Most of the Imperial staff was killed and became flesh-craving undead creatures. Luckily, Tk-216 survived the attack of the creatures and finally managed to escape the area, avoiding containment into the promptly-established Quarantine Zone. Tk-216 and other people, such as Illrian Nhagy and Tyla Gallamby, were still present near the Quarantine Zone, awaiting evaluation out of the planet, when independent spacers started to arrive on Dathomir to investigate the outbreak.\nTk-216 appeared as a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tk-216 was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13\", released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong\", an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.\nUnlike most other stormtroopers in the game, Tk-216 is identified with a lower case \"k.\" It is not clear if this was deliberate, or an error on the part of the developers.",
