 "content": "Nari Strade was a female Human who served as an armsmaster in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. During the war she worked as a arms dealer on the planet Corellia where she ran a stall within the Republic controlled Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport. Strade had brown hair and eyes and tanned skin. While at her stall she wore a white and blue uniform including a helmet.\nArmsmaster Nari Strade appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Corellia. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Nari Strade was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, which labeled her as Nari Strade.",
