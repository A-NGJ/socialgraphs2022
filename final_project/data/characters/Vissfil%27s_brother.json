 "content": "Vissfil's brother was a male Brolf who worked for the resistance leader codenamed Patriot in 27 BBY. Patriot was in turn working for Kinman Doriana codenamed 'Defender' who was building a missile that he said was to assassinate Passel Argente. Vissfil and his brother captured Lorana Jinzler while she was following Jhompfi who she had seen accepting two stolen burst thrusters from Duefgrin. On their way to deliver her to Patriot and Defender they knocked her out with a strong sedative. Later Obi-Wan and Anakin showed up to rescue her. Vissil and his brother were turned over to the city police when they were found guarding Lorana and nothing more is known about them.",
