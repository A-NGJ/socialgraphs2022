 "content": "Edbit Teeks was a male Human who served as an officer in Republic Intelligence during the Clone Wars.\nAround 22 BBY, Teeks retired his work from the Republic Intelligence and decided to return to his homeworld. After returning home, he fell in love with a Tarhassan agent named Zazana Renkel, who recently joined with the Separatists. When he returned right outside his home, he was kidnapped by agents from the Tarhassan Planetary Security in which Zazana witnessed. The Republic Intelligence was able to discover this and sent a special team to search for him, along with others that were kidnapped. After Joram Kithe and his team were able to receive information on Edbit's whereabouts, they traveled to the Authority headquarters where Edbit was held captive. He was eventually rescued and they managed to escape.",
