 "content": "Waleran was Senior Lieutenant aboard the Interrogator.\nOriginally a Lieutenant and com-scan officer for the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, Waleran was a proud family man: married and with a child.\nHis talkative nature on the matter prevented him from becoming military aide to Captain Jovan Vharing who had come to admire then resent it despite Waleran's abilities as a loyal and competent leader.\nVharing had come to reconsider the position after Leeds' mistake during the attack on Qlothos and had intentions of making Waleran his protégé but was executed by Antinnis Tremayne before any promotion could happen.\nIn the aftermath, however, Waleran was made Senior Lieutenant, taking Leeds' position on the ship and from there led his subordinates.",
