 "content": "Chokla was a Human female member of the Five, a small evil-worshipping cult that lived within the remote section of space known as the Hellhoop. Chokla and her compatriots spent centuries torturing and killing visitors to the Hellhoop—notably, the Five captured and imprisoned Wutzek, the last known living Force demon. Sometime between 0 and 3 ABY, Chokla—who was romantically involved with fellow Five member Chell—and her group captured Rebel leaders Han Solo, Leia Organa and Chewbacca, preparing to kill them for their amusement as they had so many wayward travelers. However, Chewbacca managed to release Wutzek from its prison, and the demon responded in kind by slaughtering every member of the Five. Chokla witnessed the gruesome death of her lover Chell, before being killed herself.\nChokla appeared in The Pandora Effect, a 1981 comic story written by Alan Moore and published in The Empire Strikes Back Monthly 151. In the story, Chokla was drawn by Adolfo Buylla. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia mistakenly states Wutzek , killed all of the Five but Chokla, while in the comic Wutzek kills every member of the Five.",
