 "content": "A male Human with distinctively long hair and a beard in heavy braids served as one of Imperial Intelligence's false Prophets of the Dark Side.\nFollowing the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Imperial Intelligence established a mock religion known as the Church of the Dark Side. A clergy of con Prophets was constituted, including an elderly male Human with a long, braided beard. When the Prophets of the Dark Side gave shelter to the Hutt crime lord Zorba, they honored him with a huge banquet in Scardia's formal dining hall. Like most members of the Church, the braid-bearded Prophet had a refined personality, and he was shocked by the Hutt's improper table manners.",
