 "content": "Kan'grell was a male Human Soldier from Alderaan and a citizen of the Galactic Republic during the time of the Cold War against the Sith Empire.\nKan'grell was present along with General Gesselle Organa, Blenks, and Prinn inside Alderaan's planetary generator, protected by a tremendously powerful force field, which was powered by siphoning off power directly from the generator. However, a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup modeâ€”cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\nAfter the Warrior sabotaged the planetary generator and killed numerous soldiers, Kan'grell, along with Blenks, Organa and Prinn, confronted the Sith Warrior. Organa decided to make an offer to the Sith, which was refused. The Sith, who was looking for information about Organa's former handmaiden Jaesa Willsaam, started to torture Blenks, who was Organa's lover. Refusing to watch Blenks die, Organa revealed that the Jedi Padawan Jaesa Willsaam's parents were still servants at Castle Organa. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Warrior executed Organa and her bodyguards, including Kan'grell, for defying the Empire.",
