 "content": "A male Human, Davin, trained as a stormtrooper cadet at the Imperial Academy on the planet of Carida. While training there, Davin and another cadet, later designated TK329, became good friends. They parted in 4 BBY after their admittance into the Stormtrooper Corps because they were stationed at different locations. Three years later, TK329 still considered Davin to be his closest friend.\nDavin was mentioned in a tweet from TK329's in-universe Twitter account. The account was created in 2009 as a tie-in to the then-upcoming novel Death Troopers, by Joe Schreiber.\nThis character shares a first name with Davin Felth, a stormtrooper from the short story \"When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale.\" Although both Davins trained at the Academy of Carida and were active in the same timeframe, there is no explicit connection between them.",
