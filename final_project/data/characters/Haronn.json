 "content": "Haronn was a Twi'lek male who was a member of the Corellian Council during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nFollowing the Cold War, Haronn was present when the Council aligned itself with the Empire in 3640 BBY. However, he, along with other members of the Council refused to serve the Empire and remained loyal to the Republic. When the Empire invaded Corellia, Haronn decided to leave the planet with several Republic forces. However, his transport was shot down over Imperial territory in the eastern shipyards. Haronn ejected in an escape pod and was later rescued by a Republic hero.",
