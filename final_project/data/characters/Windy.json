 "content": "Windy was a human male who was a childhood friend of Luke Skywalker, a moisture farmer from Tatooine who later joined the Rebel Alliance. Other members of this circle of friends included Biggs Darklighter, Camie Marstrap, Deak, and Laze Loneozner. Obi-Wan Kenobi once rescued both Windy and 12-year-old Skywalker from a krayt dragon after discovering the two unconscious in a sandstorm.\nThe character of Windy first appeared in some of the earliest drafts for Star Wars. The character did not make the cut of the final film of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but appeared in deleted scenes and appeared in a number of Star Wars Legends stories, variously as Windom Marstrap and Windy Starkiller. The character also appears in Star Wars LINE Webtoon, but the Webtoon comic falls into a canon \"grey area\" as the comic was allowed to have cultural interpretation. The events of the comic were referenced in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition, but says that Luke was aged twelve, whereas the comic states he was thirteen.",
