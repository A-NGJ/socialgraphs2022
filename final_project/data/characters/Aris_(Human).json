 "content": "Aris was a male Human who served the Believers Sith cult during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Around 21 BBY, Aris accompanied a group of Believers to a secret base of the Metatheran Cartel trade alliance on the moon Tilnes to investigate the results of an experimental virus dispersed by the cult in the facility. However, the group became trapped inside the Cartel base and were attacked by the mutant Caarite Ko Bas, leaving Aris and the Believer Osia as the only survivors from the Believer strike team. Three hours later, Aris and Osia ambushed a team of freelance agents who had ventured to the Cartel installation and were defeated by them.\nAris was a Force-sensitive male Human who lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic and became one of the Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult active in the Cularin system. Around 21 BBY, Aris became involved in a Believer plot to develop a new virus fatal to the Caarite species. Two weeks after a staged release of the virus within a base of the Caarite-dominated Metatheran Cartel trade alliance on the moon Tilnes, the cult determined to investigate the success of their experiment. Aris was among a group of six Believers selected for the assignment and instructed to a rendezvous at a bar in the floating city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius. He was briefed on only the essential particulars of the mission and was kept in the dark about many key details including where to communicate their findings and the Believers' designs to use the virus to wipe out all Caarites.\nThe Believer strike team traveled to Tilnes on a starship and made their way to the Cartel base, which was located deep beneath the surface of the moon within a network of tunnels. Just as Aris and his comrades arrived in the facilty, an electromagnetic pulse emitted from the core of Tilnes triggered the base's security systems to seal the entrance, trapping the Believers inside. The cultists soon fell under attack from Ko Bas, a Caarite who had been transformed by the virus into an enlarged, raging mutant being, resulting in the deaths of four of their party, leaving Aris and the Believer Osia as the only survivors.\nIn search of shelter, Aris and Osia came across a concealed security office and hid inside. There, they came upon two more mutated Caarites, G and U, whom they subdued by using the Force to control their minds and by speaking to them in the Caarite native language. The two Believers then set about attempting to bypass the base's security system so that they could leave the Cartel facility, but their efforts were to no avail.\nThree hours after the Believers arrived at the base, a group of freelance agents arrived at the facility, investigating a distress signal that that was activated by the electromagnetic pulse that caused the base to seal. Their arrival took the cultists by surprise and Aris and Osia observed from a distance as the operatives fought and defeated Ko Bas, and also as the agents discovered an active sample of the anti-Caarite virus. Determined to ensure that the existence of the virus remained a secret, Aris and Osia quickly assumed positions near to the entrance to the Cartel base, planning to ensnare the operatives as the agents attempted to leave.\nThe Believer pair made their presence known to the freelance agents and Osia offered to let the operatives leave unhindered if they would surrender the virus specimen they had recovered. The agents declined and Aris and Osia attacked them, while also commanding U and G to kill the freelancers. The agents subsequently defeated the two cultists and departed the base with the viral sample.\nA devoted member of the Believers, Aris thought that doom would befall the enemies of the cult. As was standard for Believers, he bore on his right shoulder a tattoo of the spire of the Sith fortress on the planet Almas.\nAris was adept in the use of the Force to sense things, move objects, perform mind tricks, enhance his physical attributes, and also to heal himself and others. He was bilingual, being fluent in the languages Basic and Caarite.\nDuring his assignment on Tilnes, Aris wore a respirator to protect himself from the effects of the experimental virus. He was also equipped with a blast helmet and blast vest and he wielded a stun baton and blaster pistol.\nAris appeared in Caaried Away, a roleplaying adventure by Morrie Mullins set within Star Wars Legends continuity. The adventure was released in March 2003 and served as the opening instalment of the Metatheran Caution trilogy of RPGA's Living Force campaign.\nIn the adventure, the players roleplay as the freelance agents that encounter Aris in the Cartel base on Tilnes and various different outcomes are possible. If the player characters obey Osia's ultimatum to hand over the sample of the anti-Caarite virus that the agents recovered, the pair of Believers keep their word and allow the player characters to leave the Cartel base unhindered. Aris and Osia then depart the facility via a different set of tunnels to the freelance agents and head to the Believer strike teams' starship to leave Tilnes. If the player characters refuse to hand over the virus specimen, a fight breaks out with the two Believers and it is possible for Aris to be defeated and killed.\nIn the event that the player characters are beaten in the fight with the two Believers and incapacitated, Aris and Osia collect the virus sample and depart the base with the mutant Caarites U and G accompanying them, leaving the freelance operatives alive as they had no orders to kill any non-Caarites. If Aris is captured by the player characters he attempts to strangle himself to death with the Force, though his attempt at suicide can be thwarted if the agents knock him out or perform a mind trick on him. It is then possible for the player characters to coerce Aris into disclosing all that he knows about the virus and the Believers' mission to Tilnes.",
