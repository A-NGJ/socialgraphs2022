 "content": "A clone of the Kaleesh general Grievous was created by the Sith Lord Count Dooku for his master Darth Sidious. The Grievous clone was part of an experiment on Kamino to create a clone army for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, he rebelled against his creators, using laser cannons built into his arms to knock them out of the cloning chamber onto a landing pad below. He then destroyed the Khetanna, but before he could do any more damage, Dooku used a piece of the Khetanna to distract the Grievous clone, which he threw into the watery depths below. The clone jumped into the water to chase after the piece, but before Dooku and Grievous could celebrate their victory, they were chased off the planet by clone troopers.\nThe Grievous Clone appeared in \"Who Let The Clones Out\", an episode of the television series LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles.",
