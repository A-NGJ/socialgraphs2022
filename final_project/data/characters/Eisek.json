 "content": "Eisek was a male Human commander in the reconstituted Sith Empire's navy who was in command of the Harrower-class dreadnaught Valor Prevails that patrolled the Vesla system during the final year of the Cold War. After capturing SIS agent Theron Shan and his companions, Eisek attempted to make a deal with the SIS agent about the Empire's super weapons that were designed. Theron accepted his offer, but he places him in a cell after knocking him out unconscious. He was killed moments later by Darth Mekhis for his betrayal.",
