 "content": "Saltbite was a Tynnan male who was the commander of Deep Fathom, an intelligence-centric resistance group. When the group was known as Deep Current, they were able to leverage the Tynnan skill for bureaucracy in order to collect an abundance of information on deployments and shipyard cargo traffic of the Galactic Empire. Saltbite and the Deep Current were featured in a report, which was part of The Rebel Files, on potential allies of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nBy the time the Galactic Empire fell and the New Republic and Resistance grew, Deep Current became Deep Fathom, with Saltbite still in command of the group. Deep Fathom became one of the best resources for intelligence in the Unknown Regions for the Resistance. When The Rebel Files were uncovered and handed down to General Leia Organa, leader of the Resistance, Admiral Gial Ackbar and Major Caluan Ematt exchanged notes on Saltbite and Deep Fathom.",
