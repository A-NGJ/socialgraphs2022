 "content": "Proxinus was a male Human doctor living during the Galactic War. In 3639 BBY along with fellow doctors Addy Ingrol, Asirr, Evad, Tarkom and Simlo he assisted Doctor Sannus Lorrick, who was experimenting on the rakghoul virus in his laboratory on Ord Mantell. Proxinus and the scientists all believed that Lorrick was searching for a cure on the virus, but after four Tionese planets fell to the Rakghoul plague, they discovered Lorrick's true plans to evolve the virus and attempted to stop him. They were infected with the virus and placed under his control, but were soon killed when a strike team stormed the base and killed Lorrick.\nDoctor Proxinus appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the flashpoint \"Lost Island.\"",
