 "content": "Oakie Dokes was a member of the Swokes Swokes species who had pale skin and red eyes. When the bounty hunter Zam Wesell crashed her Koro-2 all-environment Exodrive airspeeder into one of the streets of the Uscru Entertainment District on the planet Coruscant in 22 BBY, Dokes was among the passersby who crowded around the wreckage of the airspeeder.\nWesell managed to escape from the vessel and fled into the nearby Outlander Club, which Dokes also entered. When the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered the club in search of Wesell, Dokes was stood near the bar while speaking to a human. While on Coruscant, Dokes wore a black dress with a large red collar.\nOakie Dokes first appeared in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Dokes was portrayed by a male extra, with both scenes filmed in Fox Studios, Sydney. The nightclub interior scene was filmed on Stage 3 on July 17, 2000. On set, director George Lucas joked that Dokes was the on-screen date for actor Anthony Daniels, who was playing club patron Dannl Faytonni in the scene. In the new Star Wars canon, Dokes was first identified in the 2020 reference book Star Wars: Book of Lists, which was written by Cole Horton.\nThe name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on May 1, 2003 in an image caption as part of the Image Attack feature on StarWars.com. The character was named for Sue Oakes, as was the entire Swokes Swokes species. Oakes is the wife of Nick Dudman, the Live Action Creature Effects Supervisor on the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.",
