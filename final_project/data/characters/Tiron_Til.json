 "content": "Tiron Til was a Sullustan gangster, owner of a criminal syndicate. At some point before 1 ABY, Til contracted fugitive smuggler Zayl Braith, which led to a good relationship between both of them. Later, Til decided to deal with Trandoshan smugglers who aimed to monopolize the spice trade in the Asamin system. Braith, who was a native of Asamin, felt too much loyalty to Asamin to allow that. She was then expelled from the syndicate, and the negotiations continued.",
