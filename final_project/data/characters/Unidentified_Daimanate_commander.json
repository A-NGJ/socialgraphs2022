 "content": "A Daimanate Commander was a Human male who was the commander of the garrison at Capital Cay on Aquilaris, a subject world of Sith Lord Daiman. He donned Daimanate military armor with a specialized helmet that left his face exposed. His forces were overwhelmed by the Hutt crime lord Zodoh during the Battle of Capital Cay. Realizing that his garrison was outnumbered and outgunned by the Hutt invaders, he ordered his men to rally and repel the invaders. Meanwhile, he planned to depart on an empty food transport and fly to Scepter Cay for more reinforcements. En route, he and his bodyguards were ambushed by Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who slew him with her lightsaber.",
