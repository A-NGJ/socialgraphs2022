 "content": "A Sullustan infant was born sometime during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Sensitive to the Force, the child was acquired by the Jedi Order and was brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the Republic's capital planet. There, the child began his training as a Jedi. However, the parents of the child had second thoughts, and hired the Zeltron bounty hunter Vianna D'Pow to retrieve their child. D'Pow secured the baby, but encountered the Jedi Master Mace Windu on her way out. The two fought, with the Sullustan strapped into a harness on D'Pow's abdomen. Windu initially believed the child was being abducted on the behalf of a criminal organization, but D'Pow revealed it was the child's parents who had hired her. Windu, surprised, claimed that it was honor for a child to become a Jedi. Disarmed, D'Pow attempted to grab her dropped blaster pistol to shoot Windu while he wasn't paying attention, but grabbed a datapad instead. The datapad contained a message that caused D'Pow to concede, and Windu agreed to return the child to its grateful parents.",
