 "content": "Tanoa Vills was a Human female who lived in the city of Dee'ja Peak on the planet Naboo, at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nTanoa Vills was a technician of Stonewall Labs until the company was closed by the time of the Battle of Yavin. In 1 ABY, she met a spacer who was trying to acquire an Old Republic droid module from Stonewall Labs. She agreed to build a sequencer that could be used in a Stonewall Labs security beacon for Professor Zanier Hudmasse. She tasked the spacer with finding three components: an XJ5 circuit board, some fractal transmitters, and some octave regulators. The spacer first acquired an XJ5 circuit board from Mummer scientists in the Mummer Cave. The spacer found fractal transmitters in old data terminals in the Dee'ja Peak junkyard. The spacer finally got octave regulators from Skaak Tipper machinists in the Skaak Tipper Cave.\nTanoa Vills later asked the spacer to investigate a shuttle that had just crashed in the Gallo Mountains. She needed the spacer to eliminate rabid narglatches, including Grizzlefur, that gathered at the crash site in order to salvage research equipment. However, the Darkwalkers plundered the crash site before. Vills thus asked the spacer to raid the Darkwalker Cave nearby to recover a stolen bio-scanner. When the spacer returned to her, Tanoa Vills gave the completed sequencer requested by Professor Hudmasse to the spacer.\nTanoa Vills appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Tanoa Vills was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
