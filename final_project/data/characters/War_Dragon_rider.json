 "content": "The rider of a Ubese Thorn-Back War Dragon wielded a modified lightsaber. The individual also possessed a blaster rifle, which they slung on the neck of his War Dragon, and also wore armor that encased their body.\nIn Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 , the \"Design An Alien\" competition was announced, inviting readers to design Star Wars aliens inspired and influenced by the original trilogy of films. 29 year old Mark Rehkopf designed the Ubese Thorn-Back War Dragon together with the War Dragon rider, submitting his artwork to the magazine for the competition. Rehkopf's entry won first place \"16 years and up\" division, and his blurb for the creature, as well as his original artwork, was published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 . Leland Chee, the Lucasfilm Ltd. continuity editor, later stated the \"Design an Alien\" material is canon. In spite of this, the War Dragon rider has not been referenced in any other Star Wars works.",
