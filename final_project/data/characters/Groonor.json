 "content": "Groonor was a Chevin male smuggler. Having retired at some point before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, by around 3643 BBY he had returned for a final job of delivering weapons through dangerous territory.\nAround that year, an individual associated with one of the two rival factions sent a companion of theirs to serve as a security escort for Groonor. The shipment was attacked by pirates, but the companion was able to protect the cargo and saved Groonor's life. Grateful, the Chevin offered them a bonus.\nGroonor was mentioned in the Crew Skill mission \"One Last Job\" in the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
