 "content": "Jonni Skaak, formerly Jonthol Mazoon, was the leader of the Naboo branch of Skaak Tippers until he was assassinated by agents of the Royal Naboo Security Forces.\nBorn to Harriet Mazoon, Skaak was himself a former RSF officer. His first mission was to reduce the nightspider population around Kaadara and eliminate the giant nightspider Noctur'lan. He was then assigned to break up a local group of smugglers who call themselves Beachcombers and arrest their leader, Phranis Bolgar. After this success, he was sent to investigate the activities of the Skaak Tippers. Becoming more and more entangled in the Skaak Tippers, he killed their leader and took up leadership himself. The RSF agent who killed him found his journal which told the story of his career as a Skaak Tipper leader.\nJonni Skaak appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jonni Skaak was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
