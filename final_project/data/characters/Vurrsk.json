 "content": "Vurrsk was a Trandoshan male warlord and the leader of a tribe on Nameel. When Vurrsk's tribe had credits stolen by Dupei monks who they were attempting to buy outlawed weaponry from, the Trandoshans attacked the monks, and the Jedi Eno Cordova and Cere Junda were sent to resolve the issue. Junda unintentionally aggravated Warlord Vurrsk and the Trandoshans, who attacked the Jedi Padawan, but were incapacitated. Cordova returned after learning that the monks had stolen the tribe's credits, and the two Jedi apologized to Vurrsk for the incident.\nDuring the era of the Galactic Republic, Vurrsk was the warlord of a Trandoshan tribe on Nameel. Vurrsk and his tribe attempted to buy outlawed weapons from a group of Dupei monks, but the monks stole credits from the tribe, leading Vurrsk and the Trandoshans to attack in retaliation. To solve the conflict, the Jedi Order sent Jedi Master Eno Cordova and his Padawan Cere Junda to Nameel, where the two Jedi attempted to discuss the matter with both the Trandoshans and the Dupei. Both sides claimed to be innocent, leading to an argument that was stopped when Junda pushed both the monks and the tribe back with the Force. Cordova stepped in, intending to speak with both parties individually to determine the truth.\nWhile Cordova spoke to the Dupei, Junda accused the Trandoshans of being at fault. Vurrsk dismissed Junda because of her young age, refusing to follow any orders she gave. Another member of the tribe challenged Vurrsk's authority, leading to a second altercation. Junda intervened, knocking the Trandoshan challenger down. However, Junda's interference in the challenge to Warlord Vurrsk insulted the Trandoshans, turning them all against the Jedi Padawan.\nJunda evaded an attack from Vurrsk, causing the warlord to trip and fall onto the ground. Junda's attempts to defend herself made the Trandoshans angrier, and a fight broke out, in which Junda managed to defeat the Trandoshans, but left them unharmed. Cordova emerged from speaking with the Dupei, having learned that they had been stealing credits from Vurrsk's tribe, and found Junda standing over the incapacitated Trandoshans. Following the incident, Junda apologized for provoking Vurrsk and his tribe, though it was too late to repair the negotiations.\nVurrsk led his tribe with strong authority, not wishing to follow the orders of someone younger than him. He retaliated when his authority over the tribe was challenged, and was insulted when Junda intervened in the challenge. Vurrsk was quick to become angry, both towards Cere Junda and at members of his tribe who challenged him. Once provoked, Vurrsk did not stand down, leading his entire tribe to attack Junda. A male Trandoshan, Vurrsk had green skin and gray eyes.\nVurrsk was able to fight in unarmed combat, though was outmatched by the abilities of the Jedi Cere Junda, who managed to knock Vurrsk down when he attacked her.\nWarlord Vurrsk owned a translator droid for speaking with individuals that did not speak his own language. He wore a dark gray jacket over a light shirt and gray pants. Vurrsk had several gold necklaces around his neck, and gold pauldrons on the shoulders of his jacket.\nWarlord Vurrsk appeared in Jedi Fallen Order - Dark Temple 1, a comic written by Matthew Rosenberg, illustrated by Paolo Villanelli, and published on September 4, 2019.",
