 "content": "Haxen Delto was a male human who served as a Colonel in the Alliance High Command on Yavin 4, where he oversaw the communications specialists that scoured HoloNet and subspace transmissions for patterns and packets of usable intelligence as part of the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service. Airen Cracken considered him the best source for eavesdropping on Imperial transmissions. He provided a report to Cracken on several Imperial superweapons\nHe also provided a report to Davits Draven on his thoughts about the ties between Geonosis and the construction of an Imperial superweapon. Cracken tasked him with coming up with a concept that a kyber crystal-powered superweapon might take. He and his team came to the conclusion that the Empire might build a fleet of ships equipped with smaller cannons that combined would be more deadly than a single moon-sized planet killer. Haxen Delto served as one of the leaders of the Alliance forces during the Battle of Endor. His methodical approach stood all in good stead.\nHaxen Delto was portrayed by Hiu Woong-Sin in the Star Wars anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
