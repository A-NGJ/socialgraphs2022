 "content": "Laseema was a blue skinned, possibly Rutian, female Twi'lek who worked for Qibbu the Hutt, as a waitress in Qibbu's Hut.\nShe was at first scared when Delta Squad, Omega Squad and Ordo came to the cantina. Soon though, she took an interest in Atin. It is not known for certain if she continued working in Qibbu's Hut but it seems likely that, after Kal Skirata rented her an apartment, she would have left her old job. During this time she was still very wary of unexpected visitors, prompting Kal to advise Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik to call ahead before arriving.\nWhen Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan gave birth to Venku Skirata, she acted as the baby's caretaker along with Besany Wennen and Jusik. She quit her job at Qibbu's and worked as a waitress in the Kragget, the cantina located below her apartment. Though in no need of credits, she insisted on earning her keep.\nDuring the Battle of Coruscant, she married Atin via comlink. After the battle she along with Kal's clan moved to Kal's home in Kyrimorut on the planet Mandalore, where she attended Etain's funeral. Being a waitress, and the only one with experience in preparing food, Laseema took charge of the clan's kitchen, taking on the major task of feeding at least twenty individuals at a time.",
