 "content": "Sannab Ro was a Xidelphiad female who led a storied career as a fine artist. In the build up to the vote for the Military Creation Act in the Galactic Senate, she created a propaganda poster for the Commission for a Safe and Secure Republic think tank intended for use in the Core Worlds. The poster prompted viewers to vote yes on the act, which would allow the Galactic Republic to create a standing military. By the year 34 ABY, Ro was entering her fourth protogynic phase as a chrysalis on Level 5121 of the planet Coruscant, and was expected to emerge as a male at some point within the next fifteen years.\nSannab Ro was first mentioned in Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.",
