 "content": "Tsillin Wel was a Quarren working with New Republic Intelligence, and specialized in tracking accounts used by Imperial Intelligence to pay their operatives, spies, and other ancillary agents. She was brought in to testify during Tycho Celchu's treason and murder trial in 7 ABY on Coruscant. She testified in regard to the fifteen million credits that was deposited in a total of six accounts that supposedly belonged to Tycho in an attempt to paint him as a turncoat in the employ of Ysanne Isard.",
