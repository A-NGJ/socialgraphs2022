 "content": "T'Chttrk was a female T'kkrpk officer in the New Republic Navy. Her exact age was unknown even to her, since her species started to calculate time according to the Galactic Standard Calendar only after her homeworld's Great Reconciliation circa 95 BBY; by this time she had already long been adult and a hereditary officer in the planet's defense force. Since her language was unintelligible to members of other species, she used a D-series protocol droid, D-P4M as an interpreter.\nAround 5.5 ABY, she served in the rank of commander as the captain of a ship in the Rapid Response Task Force commanded by Admiral Kalback. She participated in the Battle of Mindor.",
