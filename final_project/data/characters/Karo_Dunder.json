 "content": "Karo Dunder was a male Human criminal in the Cold War. Around 3643 BBY he was present in on Nar Shaddaa, where he was killed.\nKaro Dunder appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Nar Shaddaa. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
