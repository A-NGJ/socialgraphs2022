 "content": "Xeebi's daughter was a Rodian female who, along with her mother, was freed from slavery on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine by the former Naboo Royal Handmaiden Sabé in 28 BBY. Along with the others rescued by Sabé and Captain Tonra, she was taken to the planet Karlinus in the Chommell sector, where they automatically became citizens. Making their home on Karlinus, six years after being freed, they met with Sabé's friend and Naboo legislator Saché.\nXeebi's daughter first appeared in the 2019 young adult novel Queen's Shadow, written by E. K. Johnston.",
