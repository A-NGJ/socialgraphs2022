 "content": "Revinal Orzik was a Human male Captain of the Black Talon, a Gage-class transport, in the Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nNear the end of the Cold War, Orzik disobeyed a direct order from Grand Moff Rycus Kilran. Kilran then dispatched a strike team to discipline Orzik for disobeying orders. When Kilran's agents entered his ship, he refused to comply with Moff's orders and was killed for treason.\nRevinal Orzik was featured in a development diary released by BioWare.\nPlayers have the two options: they can kill Orzik for dark alignment points or spare him for light alignment points. If he is killed, Republic droids board the Imperial ship. Also, several crew members become terrified and are executed by the new commanding officer Lieutenant Sylas; by the time the player returns from the Brentaal Star, every personnel in the bridge except for NR-02 are found dead. If Orzik is spared, Republic humans instead attack the Black Talon. When the player prove to be successful in their mission, Orzik repents on his actions.",
