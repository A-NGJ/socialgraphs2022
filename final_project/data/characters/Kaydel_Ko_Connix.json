 "content": "Kaydel Ko Connix was a human female who lived during the era of the New Republic and the subsequent war between the First Order and the Resistance. Born on Dulathia, Connix ultimately joined the Resistance; and was stationed at their D'Qar headquarters. Serving under General Leia Organa, a veteran of the Rebel Alliance and leader of the Resistance, she worked as an operations controller in Fleet Command.\nConnix's service resulted in her promotion to lieutenant following the Battle of Starkiller Base. Anticipating a First Order retaliatory strike, Connix was entrusted with supervising the evacuation of D'Qar. After narrowly escaping the planet just prior to the base's destruction, she resumed her responsibilities as a sensor ops officer aboard the Star Cruiser Raddus.\nDuring the flight of the Resistance fleet, Connix was one of several officers who supported Poe Dameron's mutiny against Admiral Holdo. Their efforts ultimately failed, however, when Dameron was incapacitated by Organa herself. Despite their mutiny, Connix and Dameron remained in service to the Resistance during the Battle of Crait. They were among the few survivors who escaped the battle aboard the Millennium Falcon.\nConnix remained a lieutenant in the Resistance, putting her past as a mutineer behind her and regaining the trust of Organa. She helped set up the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss, and later participated in the battle of Exegol. After surviving the battle, she celebrated with the rest of the Resistance.\nKaydel Ko Connix was a native of Dulathia. As political relations worsened between the New Republic and the First Order, the latter was opposed by Leia Organa, who founded a private military group known as the Resistance to monitor the First Order's activities. Connix ultimately joined the naval branch of the Resistance and was assigned to Fleet Command. By 34 ABY, Connix was serving as an operations controller under the direct command of Organa, who—in her capacity as leader of the Resistance—assumed the rank of general.\nFollowing the Hosnian Cataclysm and the Battle of Takodana, the Resistance attacked Starkiller Base in the hope of destroying the superweapon. During the battle, Connix coordinated communications between the resistance pilots and their commanders from the Resistance base on D'Qar. After the destruction of Starkiller Base, Connix was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in recognition of her service as an operations controller; and was tasked with overseeing the D'Qar evacuation; prioritizing the recovery of supplies, and coordinating an organized retreat. She was still on the planet's surface when the First Order Navy invaded the system. The base was destroyed from orbit by the Dreadnought Fulminatrix, although Connix managed to escape just in time on one of the last departing shuttles. After boarding the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus, she returned to her duties as an operations controller.\nWhile the Resistance fleet fled from the First Order, including the First Order's flagship Supremacy, Poe Dameron enlisted Connix's assistance for an unauthorized mission—to help Finn and Rose Tico disable the First Order's hyperspace tracking system. Using her position on the ship's bridge, Connix ensured that their departure went unnoticed by Vice Admiral Holdo. After discovering Holdo's intention to evacuate the crew of the Raddus, Connix and several Resistance officers supported Dameron's mutiny against Holdo. With the admiral and her supporters detained at blaster point, Connix and Dameron seized control of the bridge. However, they were ultimately confronted by a recovered Organa. Using the stun setting on her blaster, the general shot Dameron and accepted Connix's surrender.\nDespite her role in the conspiracy against Holdo, Connix continued to serve the Resistance and was among the survivors who took control of an abandoned Rebel Alliance outpost on Crait. The ensuing battle marked the near destruction of the Resistance. However, Connix was able to escape with Organa, Dameron, and several other survivors aboard the Millennium Falcon.\nAfter the battle on Crait, Connix put the mutiny behind her. She was still trusted by Organa and retained her rank though the general was disappointed that Connix had supported Dameron's actions. However, Organa knew she had meant well, and forgave her. During her time at the Resistance Camp on the garbage planet of Anoat, Connix witnessed the destruction of Tah'Nuhna and informed General Organa. She also assured Organa that the General had done everything she could and it wasn't her fault, pointing at their main mission of protecting as many as they can as long as they were still alive. Later, she also informed General Jonato about a First Order armada heading towards Mon Cala where General Organa, Rey, Rose Tico, and C-3PO had gone on a mission. Jonato wanted to contact and warn Organa but Connix informed him that the First Order was also blocking communication across the system.\nSometime later, Connix helped Tico and Beaumont Kin establish a new base on Ajan Kloss.\nWhen the Resistance heard word of Darth Sidious' return on the Sith world Exegol they sent a force to destroy him before he could escape the planet. Connix, alongside Tico and Kin, participated in the assault on the Sith Eternal's navigation tower on the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast. During the assault, Connix injured her leg and was helped back to the Fortitude by Kin. She later celebrated the end of the First Order at the Resistance base alongside Tico and Kin.\nKaydel Ko Connix was a human female with light skin, brown eyes, and blond hair which she wore up in two buns. By the time of 35 ABY, Connix's hair had turned brown. Like many other female Resistance women, she was influenced by Resistance leader Princess Leia's hairstyle and wore her hair wrapped around her head like a crown. Her service as an operations controller was viewed favorably by her superiors, resulting in Connix's rise to the rank of lieutenant. However, while serving under Amilyn Holdo, Connix sympathized with Poe Dameron's misgivings about the Vice Admiral's leadership style. Her support for Dameron led Connix to engage in activities ranging from conspiracy to open rebellion against Holdo. After abandoning the Raddus during the First Order's assault on the Resistance fleet, Connix watched as Holdo altered course and assumed that the Vice Admiral was trying to save herself. In reality, Holdo was intending to ram the Supremacy.\nAs an officer of the Resistance, Connix wore a brown junior controller's uniform, a comlink headset, and was armed with a blaster pistol. After her promotion, Connix's received a brown officer's uniform that included her lieutenant rank badge.\nKaydel Ko Connix was played by Billie Lourd in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi and Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. Lourd is the daughter of actress Carrie Fisher, who played Leia Organa in the Star Wars saga. She originally auditioned for the main role of Rey, but lost out to Daisy Ridley. This in turn led The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams to create Connix's character specifically for Lourd.\nThe character was listed as \"Lieutenant Connix\" in the end credits of The Force Awakens, and was identified as \"Kaydel Ko\" in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
