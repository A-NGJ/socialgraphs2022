 "content": "Permon Trel was a male Human Jedi who served the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was stationed aboard the space station Carrick Station.\nPermon Trel appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendor for the Jedi Knight class; his actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history, and he has been added and removed from various worlds as well. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
