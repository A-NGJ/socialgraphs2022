 "content": "Tiatha was a male Jawa who lived on the desert planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. Tiatha stole his brother's ion blaster, a family heirloom, to use as his personal weapon. After four seasons, the blaster earned Tiatha enough wealth to retire. Tiatha was a legendary scavenger of rare quality. Very few of his fellow scavengers could match his talent for turning an old starship's husk into a \"veritable palace\". Tiatha had yellow eyes. His equipment included a bandolier strapped diagonally across the chest of his robes, above another bandolier worn as a belt.\nTiatha was created for two cards in the Premiere set of Decipher's 2001 Jedi Knights Trading Card Game.",
