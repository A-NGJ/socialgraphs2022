 "content": "CT-014/783, also known as \"Eight-Three\", was a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He served as a gunner on a LAAT/i along with CT-6/774 during the Battle of Haruun Kal.\nEight-Three was commanded by clone trooper lieutenant Four-One and 2nd Lieutenant CL-33/890.\nHis gunship was assigned to the medium cruiser Halleck and sustained heavy damage during the action at Haruun Kal, though the ship endured and assisted with the rescue of stranded surviving clones. Eight-Three's turret was separated from his gunship during the battle. He drifted in space, with no method of propulsion. After the battle, he was recovered by his Gunship, and continued to serve the republic.",
