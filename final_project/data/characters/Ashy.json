 "content": "Ashy was the name of a Rattataki male pilot in the Republic Navy. Originally adopted by a pair of Imperial aristocrats, Ashy was named due to his species' skin color, and made to believe he could join the Imperial Military, due to his adoptive parents' dressing him up as an Imperial officer at parties. When Ashy discovered that they simply found it amusing, and he would never be an Imperial soldier, he fled to the Galactic Republic and became a starfighter pilot.",
