 "content": "Tanis Mothma was a Human female who was governor of Hanna City on Chandrila during the years prior to the Clone Wars. Her husband was an arbiter-general of the Galactic Republic and their daughter, Mon Mothma became the senator of the Bormea sector.\nTanis Mothma was a Human female who resided on Chandrila. She was married to a man who served as an arbiter-general for the Galactic Republic, and the pair had a daughter, Mon Mothma. Mothma served as governor of Hanna City in the lead up to the Clone Wars. She taught her daughter how to administer, organize, and lead. In 22 BBY, Mothma commented on the walk-out by the planet's Public Safety Commission—protesting over the vote to create a Grand Army of the Republic—noting that they had done everything possible to ensure that their strike had not endangered others by programming droids to cover the increased workload. Eventually, Mothma was replaced as governor of Hanna City by Jovive Centi.",
