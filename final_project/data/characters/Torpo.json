 "content": "Torpo the Hutt was a Hutt and distant cousin of Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Around 21 BBY during the Clone Wars, Torpo was suspected by Jabba for brokering a deal with the Confederacy of Independent Systems to access the Valsedian asteroid belt in Hutt Space, which was in violation of a treaty made with the Galactic Republic concerning supply routes. The Jedi Order was requested to and dispatched a team consisting of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Keelyvine Reus, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and Padawans Tyzen Xebec and Ahsoka Tano to the Valsedian asteroid belt to investigate and negotiate a resolution to the situation. He was later found in a room where he begged for the Jedi to help him, but he was quickly stabbed in the back by Asajj Ventress.",
