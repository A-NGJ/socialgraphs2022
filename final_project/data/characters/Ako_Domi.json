 "content": "Ako Domi was a legendary Human male Jedi Knight who fought in the Battle of Sullust during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Domi was captured during the battle and imprisoned in various prisons until he was sent to the district of Shadow Town on Nar Shaddaa in 3649 BBY. During that time, he fell to the dark side of the Force and became a self-proclaimed Sith who ruled over the other inmates, two of which became his apprentices. Six years later, Domi was later defeated by Republic operatives and returned to Tython for healing during the Cold War. While being cared for by Tython's best healers, he continued to profess that he was beyond redemption, but the Jedi High Council continued to treat him since they felt that he wasn't lost to the Order forever and that the atrocities inflicted on him by the Empire would eventually be undone.",
