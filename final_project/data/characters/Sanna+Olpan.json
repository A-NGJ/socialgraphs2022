When the fighting came to Cato Neimoidia, Olpan's son was arrested by Jedi Knight Suljo Warde and placed in the Southside Prison for the crime of conspiring against the Galactic Republic. Believing her son to be innocent, Olpan held on to her resentment for two decades, during which time she had no knowledge of whether her son was still imprisoned at the facility, dead, or had been released and turned to crime.",
