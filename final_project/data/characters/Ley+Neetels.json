 "content": "Ley Neetels was a Pa'lowick Jedi who lived at least three thousand years before the reign of the Galactic Empire. As a member of the Pa'lowick race, Neetels perceived the Force as a dissonant mixture of musical tones emanating throughout the galaxy. This trait compelled Neetels to seek balance in the Force by discovering new worlds as a space explorer.\nWhile investigating the planet Jerrilek, Neetels became drawn to a familiar musical sensation through the Force, believing it to be an undiscovered location in the galaxy's Deep Core. Piloting the Wandering Diva, the Pa'lowick Jedi relied on the Force as a guide, making several hyperspace jumps while pursuing the source of the musical tones. This search ultimately led Neetels to the world of Tython, along with the moons of Ashla and Bogan.",
