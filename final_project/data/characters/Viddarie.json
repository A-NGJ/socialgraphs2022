 "content": "Viddarie was a male who was, by the year 3963 BBY, the security chief on the Republic Navy battleship Courageous, serving under Admiral Saul Karath. Viddarie was present on the Courageous when the ship traveled, with a battle group, to protect the world of Serroco from attack during the Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian warrior clans. While the Courageous orbited Serroco, fugitive former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick bluffed his way onto the ship's bridge, hoping to warn Admiral Karath of a vision he had had of the Mandalorians destroying the planet. Karath recognized him immediately, and had Viddarie place Carrick in binders. Viddarie had light orange skin that was covered in small tentacle-like protrusions, and he had a tail for which a hole was cut in his Republic Navy uniform.\nViddarie appeared in Knights of the Old Republic 15, a comic written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2007. In his sole appearance, Viddarie was illustrated by Dustin Weaver.",
