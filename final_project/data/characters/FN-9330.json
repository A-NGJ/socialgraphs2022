 "content": "FN-9330 was a human male stormtrooper who served in the First Order during their conflict with the Resistance. Shortly before Battle of Starkiller Base, FN-9330 was stationed at the base. As the trooper was boarding the transport compartment, the doors opened, revealing Han Solo, Finn, and Chewbacca in front of him. He had just enough time to exclaim his surprise before being shot point-blank with the Wookiee's bowcaster, blasting the trooper several feet backwards and killing him. Chewbacca then moved his body out of sight to avoid detection at the base.\nFN-9330 was played by Nigel Godrich in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Godrich, a well-known record producer, landed the role with the help of British filmmaker Edgar Wright . The specific stormtrooper he played was discovered when Matthew Wood posted the credits for every small voiceover line in the film.",
