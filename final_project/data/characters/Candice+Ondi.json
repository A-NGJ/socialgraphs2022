 "content": "Captain Candice Ondi was a Human female colonist from Sulon who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, serving as an informations officer.\nIn 1 BBY, Candice Ondi was a member of Alliance Intelligence responsible for making anti-Imperial propaganda news reports. Katarn and Ondi felt an attraction toward each other.\nShe was the original owner of the modified protocol droid A-Cee, and herself was equipped with a holocam.\nDuring the Subjugation of Sulon, she received Morgan's footage from his electrobinoculars documenting the assault of commandoes at his farm. Expecting an Imperial assault at the G-Tap, she went there with A-Cee preparing to document everything that would happen, and were joined by Morgan and other Rebels. Candice could see through Morgan's feigned optimism and they exchanged pleasantries, wishing the best for both.\nMorgan and Candice fought together. They witnessed the deaths of Jen and Trol, and Morgan ordered her and other survivors to retreat to the caves, but not before asking from her the services of A-Cee. As they retreated, Morgan narrated to the droid the events that transpired before the assault and covered the droid's departure.\nIt was the last time they saw each other, as Morgan retreated while she was covering the story; Candice was mortally wounded when the second AT-ST arraved, and A-Cee ran towards her. She attempted to say a final word, and died in his arms.\nAt the time of her death, Candice Ondi looked like a pleasant middle-aged woman. Her face was smiley, marked by large intelligent brown-green eyes matching her brown hair. During business she wore the makeshift Rebel \"uniform\" of gray coveralls, which hid her otherwise nice figure. Her gestures and intimate behavior towards Morgan Katarn  showed some personal affection.\nThe narration of the Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire gives a tense last meeting between Morgan Katarn and Candice, shortly before the Imperial assault, stating that they never saw each other again, as they both died in that fight. The audio drama however shows that they fought together, until Morgan ordered her to lead others to the caves.",
