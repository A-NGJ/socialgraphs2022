He was stationed to Tatooine after it was learned that Luke Skywalker was a native of the planet. Nos-Carron received orders to ensure that Jared Tome recovered the Shard of Alderaan computer program, so Nos-Carron pretended to stumble aboard the Dune Princess shortly before the auction of the Shard of Alderaan.",
