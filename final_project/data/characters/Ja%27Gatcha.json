 "content": "Ja'Gatcha was a male Paaerduag from the planet known in Galactic Basic Standard as \"Sorjus.\" The joined being left his homeworld to travel the galaxy. During these travels Ja-Gatcha became stranded on the world of Taris after the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak's Empire attacked the Galactic Republic cruiser Endar Spire and then initiated a planet-wide blockade in an attempt to capture the Jedi Bastila Shan. While stuck on Taris, Ja'Gatcha visited Javyar's Cantina located in the Lower City, where he would field questions and avoid mockery.\nJa'Gatcha, a Paaerduag male, lived on the planet known as Sorjus in Galactic Basic during the time of the Jedi Civil War. Originally the being began life as two separate individuals. However, like all other members of their species these two eventually become one. The combined being left the planet and traveled about the galaxy some time before 3956 BBY. On one such trip he stopped on the Outer Rim world Taris to pick up supplies. During this time, forces belonging to the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak's Sith Empire attacked the Republic Hammerhead-class cruiser Endar Spire over Taris in an attempt to capture the Jedi Bastila Shan. Once the cruiser was destroyed, a blockade was raised and the planet was quarantined, forcing Ja'Gatcha to remain on the planet. Deciding to hide out in Javyar's Cantina in order to avoid the Upper City's anti-alien laws, Ja'Gatcha stayed put and attempted to deflect mockery.\nThe Republic soldier Revan met Ja'Gatcha in the cantina sometime after the former's crash on Taris. The Paaerduag, pleased that Revan did not intend to look down on him, revealed a few facts about his life, species, homeworld, and predicament.\nJa'Gatcha felt that his species was the \"pinnacle of evolution\" and as such looked down on other, \"lesser\" species. However, not all individuals shared their outlook, and as such would fling insults at the Paaerduag. Due to this Ja'Gatcha possessed an edgy and paranoid personality. However, once an individual revealed that his intentions were not hostile or mocking, Ja'Gatcha would open up and answer some questions, though he refrained from speaking of his home planet due to missing his home and not being able to return. Ja'Gatcha had black eyes and green skin on the main portion of his body.\nJa'Gatcha's first and only appearance was as a non-player-character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. There, the player character could interact with him. However, the nature of the conversation was such that it did not progress any plot lines, nor did it change the player character's alignment, and therefore it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with the Paaerduag or whether or not he insulted Ja'Gatcha or sympathized with him.",
