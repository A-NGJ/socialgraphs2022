 "content": "Ulo Enan was an Ithorian masseur, and Vanster Enan's distant cousin.\nAlthough the Enans primarily worked in catering jobs, Ulo decided to go to Rorkee, a city in Genarius, to follow the career of his choosing. He massaged heterodoxally, holding two bars in the ceiling and using his big feet to work the customer's back. Although unusual, he was very effective and so he obtained a job in the Sanads of Rorkee hotel.\nIn 31 BBY, Enan treated some workers of the Dorumaa Excavation simulation. They had kidnapped Dr. Shilaea Motacc, but she had managed to kick them severely during the act, so they were in need of some massage.",
