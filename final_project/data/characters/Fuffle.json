 "content": "Fuffle was a Hoojib who accompanied Plif, C-3PO, Chewbacca and several other Hoojibs into a tunnel under the Alliance to Restore the Republic base on Arbra to look for R2-D2. They were attacked by the Darker, a being which could control emotions, and which heightened the Hoojibs' inclination to fear, making them flee in panic. As the Darker turned his attention to Chewbacca, his grip on the Hoojibs, Fuffle included, was lessened. Charging the mysterious being, they were able to distract its attention long enough for the Wookiee to kill it.",
