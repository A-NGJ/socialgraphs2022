 "content": "Jaffro Davengatt was a male Human entrepreneur who established the farm Davengatt's Double-Zed Nerf Ranch on the planet Engebo V at some point during galactic history. Davengatt's business specialized at producing high-quality nerf meat that commanded high prices, and the operation brought prosperity to Engebo V. However, Davengatt became reclusive and he focused on adding gadgets to his mansion, delegating the day-to-day running of his business to his daughter, Nell Davengatt. However, after the Snivvian Goontirk inadvertently introduced skekfish to Engegbo V, the creatures infested the planet and devoured Davengatt.",
