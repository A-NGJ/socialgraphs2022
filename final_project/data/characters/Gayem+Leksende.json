 "content": "Gayem Leksende was a Human male cyborg who worked for the Czerka Corporation during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Gayem was assigned by the Corporation to stop the Republic from finding a facility that was buried on Tatooine. Since he was very intrigued by this doomsday device, his superiors warned him to stay away, but he ignored their advice and wanted to take the device for himself.\nHowever, a Republic strike team sent by Agent Fauler of the Republic Strategic Information Service was also searching for the lost facility. Rather than choose a direct confrontation, Gayem relied on proxies to accomplish his goals. Eventually, a listening post monitoring the strike team gathering their data to pinpoint the facility's location in the Dune Sea. But rather than head there first, Gayem held back as the strike team fought through the swarms of cyberneurotic zombies infected by a Rakata artifact containing the mind of the Imprisoned One. When the strike team managed to destroy all of the Imprisoned One's pawns and humbled the entity, Gayem took his chance to appear. He was willing to offer a large sum of credits if the strike team gives him the device, as well as promising to lift the kill order on Kamus Orden. The strike team refused and destroyed the device which angered Gayem. Gayem and his bodyguard engaged the strike team and were both defeated.\nIn the dark side option, the player accepts the deal and allows Gayem to have the device.",
