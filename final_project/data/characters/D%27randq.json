 "content": "D'randq was a male Barabel who was a member of the Believers during the final years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn c. 31 BBY, D'randq became part of a group of Dark Jedi at the Almas Sith fortress who served Garvin Delquist, a researcher who had gained control of the dark side of the Force from a Sith amulet. D'randq served as one of Delquist's bodyguards. After Delquist had the Jedi Misha Quor-Din captured and taken to the fortress, the Heroes of Cularin traveled there to rescue her and D'randq and Delquist's other bodyguards fought against them.",
