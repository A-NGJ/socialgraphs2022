 "content": "Grimraker was a human male scavenger active on Hoth during the Galactic Civil War. During the Uprising against Governor Ubrik Adelhard's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, he lent his services to a young smuggler, under threat of having his staging ground taken and his people driven out. In addition to leaving the staging ground under his control, the smuggler also offered to pay Grimraker to assist his allies in setting up camp.\nGrimraker was created by Kabam for Star Wars: Uprising, a canon mobile game for iOS and Android operating systems released in 2015.",
