Circa 1 ABY, he was confronted by at least one individual seeking entrance to the mines, and was killed for his pass key.\nThe Death Watch Wraith, as a Mandalorian soldier, wore silver-colored Mandalorian armor made from alum metal. His helmet was equipped with a mounted rangefinder, and red trim outlined his HUD-equipped visor. In addition, he wore heavy combat boots. During his time at the Death Watch's bunker on Endor, the Wraith made use of a blaster assault rifle as a weapon.\nThe Death Watch Wraith was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.",
