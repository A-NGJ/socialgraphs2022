 "content": "Dindau was a male Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 32 BBY, Dindau was Captain of the transport Daring when it participated in the Confederation Rock Rush, the exploration of the Cularin system asteroid belt. Also aboard the Daring was his crew: his first mate Kohlbacca, a female albino Wookiee; and Herren, a human who was the ship's gunner and engineer. However, the ship collided with an asteroid and was severely damaged. With the life support systems failing, Dindau sent at a distress call to any nearby ships. It was picked up by the Neeva-Beelo and its crew, the famous Heroes of Cularin, attempted to rescue Dindau and his crew before it was too late.",
