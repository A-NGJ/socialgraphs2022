 "content": "Bala Nisi was a female Human Jedi Master and member of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council during the Great Hunt and Mandalorian Wars.\nLess harsh in her judgments than fellow Master Vrook Lamar, Master Nisi did not hold Duron Qel-Droma's relationship to Ulic Qel-Droma against him. She believed that it was one's choices, not bloodline, that could lead to the dark side. She agreed with Vrook, however, that the small group of three Jedi Knights secretly sent to Korriban to purge the planet of terentateks was too small, fearing that the party would be corrupted by the planet's dark influence.\nShe was still on the council as of 3964 BBY, but was replaced by Master Dorak by 3956 BBY.\nAlthough she is only named as Bala in \"Shadows and Light\", Joshua Ortega, author of the comic, later gave her full name on the Dark Horse Comics message boards.",
