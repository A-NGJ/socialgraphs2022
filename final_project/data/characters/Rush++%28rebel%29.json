 "content": "Rush was a human male soldier for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was known to carry thermal detonators with him on missions. During the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire, Rush was detained by Imperial troops on the planet Jedha. He was eventually rescued by fellow rebel soldiers.\nRush was a human male who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic sometime during or before the year 0 BBY. Rush served as a soldier with a penchant for thermal detonators. During battle, Rush could throw three detonators at a time which would allow him to fully attack a wide area.\nAt some point during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire, Rush was captured by Imperial forces and detained on the planet Jedha. Eventually, a trio of rebel operatives rescued Rush and eliminated his guards. However, the bunker Rush was held at became a point of defense for the rescue team, as Imperial stormtroopers attempted an offensive to cease the rebel escape. Rush and his comrades held out until a squad of X-wing starfighters swooped by and eliminated the remaining Imperial troops. Rush rejoined the Alliance, and may have continued to serve in further operations on Jedha and, later, the planet Scariff.\nRush was a dark-skinned human with brown eyes. When the Empire tried to end his rescuers mission, Rush fought by their side.\nRush was known to carry thermal detonators with him in addition to a blaster rifle. He wore the fatigues of a Rebel trooper.\nRush was created as a playable character for the online browser video game Star Wars: Boots on the Ground. Players could select Rush to be a member of their three-man rebel squad after undergoing a mission to rescue him.\nGiven the freedom that the player has in creating their squad, there is no certainty as to what further missions in the game, if any, Rush actually participated in.",
