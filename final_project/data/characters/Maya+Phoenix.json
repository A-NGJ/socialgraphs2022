 "content": "Maya Phoenix was a female Togruta who attended the Jedi academy based at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. She was known to be a hard and determined worker and was part of the school's drama club. Her favorite subject at the academy was Principles of the Force and she proved adept at the use of the the Force. She sometimes enjoyed singing songs in her mirror when unobserved and was a talented singer. She performed the role of Penelope Doodle in a class play of the hit drama My Fair L8-E. Both Zachary O'Halleran and Victor Starspeeder, fellow Padawans at the academy, sought her affections, but she was more concerned with her studies at the time.",
