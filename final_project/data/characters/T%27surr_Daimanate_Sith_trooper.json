 "content": "A T'surr served as a Daimanate Sith trooper on Chelloa in 1032 BBY. During the Raid on Chelloa, he was about to kill undercover Jedi and Chelloan resistance leader Gorlan Palladane and several other slave workers when he was knocked unconscious by the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who sliced his crowbar in mace in half. His companion was a bald human officer who was also incapacitated by Gorlan himself.\nHe survived the battle and was present during Sith Lord Daiman's interrogation of Gorlan. He held a bound Gorlan while the latter was punched and kicked by Daiman who had discovered the agent who had leaked intelligence about his baradium operations to the Jedi and his rival Lord Odion.",
