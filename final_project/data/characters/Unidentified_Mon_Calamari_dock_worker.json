 "content": "A Mon Calamari dock worker worked at a port on the estuary moon of Trask. The dock worker watched the Mandalorian Din Djarin's gunship the Razor Crest descend to the surface and fall into the water. After Djarin came out, the Mandalorian employed the Mon Calamari to make repairs to his ship, paying one thousand credits. The dock worker did a patchwork job and repaired the sublight engines, and when Djarin returned he was displeased with the work. The Mon Calamari ultimately made Djarin agree to the repairs on a datapad.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, the Mon Calamari worked as a dock worker at a black market port on the estuary moon of Trask. Around 9 ABY, the dock worker was present at a launchpad at the port when the gunship Razor Crest entered Trask's atmosphere at high speed, plummeting towards the surface. The Mon Calamari witnessed the Crest falling and catching fire, before rapidly decelerating before the launchpad to make a swift landing. One of the gunship's sublight engines then malfunctioned and the Razor Crest swerved into the sea beside the launchpad, prompting a shaking head from the dock worker.\nAfter the Razor Crest was carried onto the launchpad by a mobile loading gantry, the gunship's pilot and owner, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, came out and was greeted by the dock worker. The Mon Calamari asked what help was required, and Djarin asked back whether the dock worker could fix the Crest. The dock worker replied that the gunship could be made to fly again, and so the Mandalorian gave him thousand credits to do make whatever repairs were possible. Mon Calamari verbally decided to fuel the Razor Crest, but showed skepticism on whether the gunship could still hold fuel.\nThe Mon Calamari got to work on the Razor Crest, patching up hull breaches, repairing the engines and leaving netting and lines within the cockpit. When Djarin returned, he was dissatisfied with the work, remarking that he had given the dock worker a thousand credits. The dock worker then reached a datapad out for the Mandalorian to consult regarding the commission of the repairs. Djarin complied and agreed to the repairs before departing on the Crest, which took off very shakily.\nThe Mon Calamari dock worker had brown skin and orange eyes. The dock worker gave a shaking head upon seeing the Razor Crest fall into the ocean. The Mon Calamari was doubtful about being able to entirely fix the gunship, showing skepticism on whether the vessel could still hold fuel. After Din Djarin complained on the quality of the dock worker's work, the worker proceeded to show the Mandalorian to a datapad to agree to the repairs.\nThe dock worker specialized in repairing vehicles like the Razor Crest, although his work on the gunship did not entirely satisfy Din Djarin, who had to receive further repairs on the planet Nevarro.\nThe Mon Calamari wore a blue sweater with a black overall over it which had white straps and outlines. The dock worker also had a brown belt with compartments and used a datapad.\nThe mon calamari dock worker appeared in \"Chapter 11: The Heiress\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Bryce Dallas Howard and released on November 13, 2020. Credited as \"dock worker\" in the subtitles, he was played by the costume's craftsman Frank Ippolito, with Janina Gavankar, who played Iden Versio in Star Wars Battlefront II, serving as one of two puppeteers. The character made a brief cameo appearance in a market on the planet Tao in the Star Wars: Visions short film \"Lop \u0026 Och≈ç.\"\nIppolito created the Mon Calamari's headpiece and, because it took two puppeteers to animate it, he asked Gavankar to handle the nostrils when a second one was required. The Mon Calamari's clothing was designed by costume designer Shawna Trpcic and made from authentic wools which had been over dyed, stained and aged to make it look vintage like. Following the release of \"Chapter 11: The Heiress,\" the dock worker received attention over Twitter over the Mon Calamari's sweater.",
