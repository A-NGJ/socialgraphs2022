 "content": "This Imperial officer served on the Imperial Interdictor and had a run in with Rex and Kanan Jarrus, both disguised as stormtroopers to rescue Ezra Bridger, Jun Sato and the crew from the Liberator. He had a brief conversation with them, noticing Rex's armor was a little tight. Rex quietly insulted the officer, with the officer asking what he said, Kanan told him that he had a hyper-sickness and took \"565\" to the \"257\" which the officer replied that that would be the last place he'd take him since it was the commissary.\nHe was voiced by Steve Blum who also voiced Garazeb Orrelios in the same series. He was listed as \"Imperial Officer #1\".\nHe's one of the few unnamed officers whose eyes were visible.",
