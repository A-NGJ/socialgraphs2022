 "content": "An unidentified Zabrak was a member of the Nightbrothers during the Clone Wars.\nThis Zabrak was one of the many brought forward by Brother Viscus to appear in front of Asajj Ventress for her selection of capable potential candidates to aid in her plan to get revenge against Count Dooku. This Zabrak made it past the initial selection and along with five other Zabraks fought Ventress in her first challenge, the test of arms. He was killed by Ventress when he attacked her with his dual axes, only to get stabbed in the stomach by her Pike.",
