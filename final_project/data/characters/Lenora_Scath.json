 "content": "Lenora Scath was a female human colonist on the planet Cyphar. She was one of the three conspirators who hired Nevil Cygni to help them smuggle spice called scarn the conspirators were digging from fields located on the area controlled by Afe clan. Cygni didn't approve smuggling of spices, but he had to maintain his reputation as an advisor in criminal activities, so he adviced the conspirators to use shellfish to smuggle their spice hoping that his adversary Thrawn would notice the operation and put an end to it. Thrawn burned the entire spice vein with turbolaser fire and captured the leaders of the conspiracy.",
