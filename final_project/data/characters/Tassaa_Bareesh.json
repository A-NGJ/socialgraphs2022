 "content": "Tassaa Bareesh was a Hutt crime lord and a matriarch of Bareesh Cartel operating off of Nal Hutta.\nAround 3643 BBY, Tassaa started an auction for artifact from a very precious and rare metals have been offered. She invited both the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire in order to outbid each other.\nAfter a failed attempt, a battle between Jedi Padawan Shigar Konshi and Sith Acolyte Eldon Ax started. The battle was short until they were both arrested after large parts of the palace were stolen and destroyed by a Mandalorian named Dao Stryver. Shigar was able to convince them of his innocence, however, he had to sign a contract with the matriarch. According to the agreement, the Padawan would track down the thief and retrieve the navicomputer which was stolen.\nThis eventually led the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire to form an alliance together and battle against an army of hex droids on Sebaddon. However, Shigar's promise to Bareesh was not kept since he failed to retrieve what was stolen. Bareesh had no choice but to drop a bounty on the Padawan.",
