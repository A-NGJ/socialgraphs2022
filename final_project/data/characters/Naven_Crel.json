 "content": "Naven Crel was a male Auditor-General for the Corporate Sector Authority. While undercover, he learned of corrupt actions by the Prex and was subsequently taken prisoner by Fiolla under trumped-up charges of industrial sabotage. The Prex dispatched his assistant, Akeeli Somerce, to kill them both discreetly, but Crel and Fiolla managed to kill Somerce. However, in the altercation, Crel was fatally wounded by Somerce. Before he died, he had Fiolla promise him to bring down the Prex, to which she agreed.",
