 "content": "Talus was a young Human male who served as one of the \"twin rulers\" of Typha-Dor, alongside Binalu, in the years leading up to the Clone Wars.\nIn 25 BBY, during the Separatist Crisis, Talus supported the Galactic Senate of the Republic and fought against an imminent invasion of his world by the fleet of Vanqor, a neighboring planet in the Uziel system.\nAs leader of the Typha-Dor High Council, Talus petitioned the Senate that it rush Jedi diplomats to his planet's aid and was intimately involved in the high-security and strategic planning meetings preparatory to Vanqor's imminent attempt to invade. He approved a preemptive countermeasure, based on secret intelligence, to trap the Vanqor fleet in a satellite-moon corridor through which the enemy made its approach.\nTalus worked not only with High General Bycha and his lesser generals, but also with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Clee Rhara, Siri Tachi, and the other Jedi envoys sent at the behest of the Senate, to negotiate a ceasefire and an enduring peace between Typha-Dor and Vanqor's ruler, Van-Ith.",
