 "content": "KM-8713 was a human female stormtrooper of the First Order who sought to have the power of higher-ranking individuals such as Captain Phasma and wanted to have an actual name like Phasma rather than a designation for herself. When the First Order attacked the iron planet Demir, with Phasma leading the assault, KM-8713 participated on the battlefield. KM-8713 was promoted to the military rank of lieutenant by Phasma, who saw KM-8713's ambition. KM-8713 eventually realized Phasma's willingness to expend soldiers, and declared her superior a traitor. KM-8713 would meet her demise attempting to kill Phasma and earn a name for herself, only to be killed by her commander instead.",
