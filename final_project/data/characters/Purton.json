 "content": "Purton was the Governor of Concord Dawn and placed a hit on Boba Fett's head in 1 BBY, as Boba had murdered his son.\nPurton was a vindictive man, hoping to extinguish Fett and his entire family for the murder of his son. He also cared deeply for his son, saying how it was terrible for a parent to outlive his own child, and mused how old his son would have been, if he had still been alive. He saw his son as a good man, so refused to accept that he'd raped Sintas Vel, Fett's wife.",
