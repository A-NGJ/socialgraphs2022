 "content": "Utooni was the name taken by a pair of Jawa brothers and scrappers active following the fall of the Galactic Empire. The two Jawas participated in the Hunters of the Outer Rim tournament on Vespaara. As they were too small to compete, the Jawa stacked one atop the other's shoulders in order to fit the height requirement. In the competition to win in the hopes of acquiring stuff, the Utooni brothers used an arsenal of oversized weaponry which they kept under their long cloak, but frequently argued about which weapon to use first. Over the various fights in the arena, the Jawa brothers gained a rivalry against fellow competitor Dizzy and his Slingshot droideka, as they always targeted Slingshot who Dizzy saw as family.\nUtooni is one of the playable characters in the upcoming 2022 competitive combat game Star Wars: Hunters, published by Zynga and Lucasfilm Games.",
