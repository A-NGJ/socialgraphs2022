 "content": "Lusica Stynnix was a human female junior officer who held the rank of lieutenant in the First Order Navy during the First Order-Resistance War. As with other members of her generation, Stynnix was born in the First Order, recruited into the military at a young age, and became one of many subadults serving on the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy—the flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke. Her uniform included a rank sash commemorating the service of Admiral Clyss Power.\nLieutenant Lusica Stynnix was a junior officer in the First Order Navy during the New Republic Era. Under the Galactic Empire's reign, youth brigades were largely symbolic pledges of patriotism. The First Order, however, recruited its youth, such as Stynnix, into actual military service. The First Order initially consisted of former Imperial personnel. Stynnix's generation, however, was raised since birth in the First Order fold.\nStynnix served on the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy—the flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke—by the time the First Order went to war against the Resistance and the galaxy. As such, she joined a crew that numbered in the millions, many of whom were subadults like Stynnix and therefore too young for active combat deployment. Due to her role in the fleet, Stynnix was assigned to the Supremacy's operations deck, where floors of open workstations bustled with efficient controllers.\nLusica Stynnix was a young human female who had dark hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. As with other members of her generation, Stynnix was fully indoctrinated into First Order ideology. Therefore, she believed that only a strong, unflinching order was capable of bringing a chaotic galaxy under control. Like her subadult peers, Stynnix possessed a natural competitive streak and was driven to excel. Due to her upbringing, she was among the First Order's most loyal servants.\nAs a naval officer, Stynnix wore a dark First Order military uniform which included a cap, black leather gloves, and two code cylinders attached to her tunic. The First Order insignia was emblazoned on Stynnix's cap and her left arm sleeve featured a rank sash that commemorated Admiral Clyss Power of the Imperial Navy. Stynnix also carried a status datapad during her service in the operations division.\nLusica Stynnix, portrayed by Jenn Murray, first appeared in the 2017 sequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. She was first identified in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary.",
