 "content": "Bubo Wamba was an Aqualish male farmer who ran the Milk Stand in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu. He founded the farming business Bubo Wamba Family Farms. He often spent his time in his stall or with his banthas. Bubo was fascinated with the wonderful mix of cultures at Black Spire, taking the opportunity to meet new people from across the galaxy.\nFour generations of the Wamba family had kept banthas on their farm on Tatooine. After years of working for his parents on Tatooine, Wamba came to Batuu with nothing but big dreams and a pack of banthas. His locally farmed blue milk was an instant hit with the locals. His stand also sold a rare imported green milk coming from thala-sirens, large marine mammals found on various aquatic planets.",
