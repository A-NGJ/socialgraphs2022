 "content": "Dool was a Human male captain of the Corellian Security Force who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDool appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Dool would have been in some way involved with the Legacy Quest. However, Dool is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
