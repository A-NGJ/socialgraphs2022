 "content": "Arrin Nikols was a male Human living on Makeb during the Galactic War along with his wife Blanca and his son Ritte. Arrin was a captain of the the InterStellar Regulators, who had been bribed by the Hutts to help them conquer Makeb in 3638 BBY. As the Hutts' mining operations soon caused the planet to start tearing itself apart, Arrin quit the Regulators and in desperation his forces attacked a number of Republic evac camps and took civilians hostage in order to secure passage aboard the Ark that was being prepared to evacuate Makeb's civilians. Arrin was defeated by Republic forces, but his wife intervened and convinced the Republic forces to permit Arrin to live. Accepting that he would face jailtime for his actions, Arrin stood down and accompanied his son and wife to the Ark.\nCaptain Nikols appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion, released on April 9, 2013. If the player chooses a Dark Side option, they kill Nikols instead.",
