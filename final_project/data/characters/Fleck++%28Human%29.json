 "content": "Fleck was a male Human under the employ of Gamgalon on Varonat in 8 ABY. He and Buzzy greeted Talon Karrde and Quelev Tapper when they arrived on Varonat.\nFleck was a Human male who lived in Tropis-on-Varonat on the planet Varonat. He worked for the Krish crime lord Gamgalon, who operated a Morodin-hunting safari in the Great Jungle as a cover for his criminal enterprises. Fleck was employed as a come-up flector, and waited at the starship landing field in Tropis-on-Varonat for prospective hunters to arrive.\nIn 8 ABY, he was at the landing field alongside Buzzy when the Uwana Buyer landed carrying two Humansâ€”Syndic Pandis Hart, chief purchasing agent of the Sif-Uwana Council, and his pilot, Captain Seoul. They had landed on Varonat due to hyperdrive trouble and were in need of a mechanic. Fleck arranged for Buzzy to contact the mechanic while he convinced Hart and Seoul that they should enjoy a safari while they wait since the repair would most likely take several days. Hart agreed, and after a little haggling, Fleck settled on a price of 17,000 credits for the both Hart and Seoul.\nFleck was an outgoing and approachable individual who was able to convince individuals to partake in the services he had to offer.\nFleck first appeared in First Contact, a short story written by Timothy Zahn and published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 1. The story wass subsequently reprinted in The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4, Tales from the Empire, and on Hyperspace.",
