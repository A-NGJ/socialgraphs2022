 "content": "Ironclaw was a brown Kentra who encountered a group of Rebels. He was astounded that the Rebels spoke Bas'c, the language of the holy prophet Tandre. He took the Rebels to see the Kentra King Jerius.\nHe was 2.2 meters tall and very muscular with a slow growl to his voice. He was a reserved individual and a Kentra of few words, yet he was warm-hearted and a brave warrior. It was said that he had traveled to all Kentra cities on Orellon II.",
