 "content": "Maela was a human female from the Deep Core planet Vulpter. As she began her service with the Galactic Empire, she worked with Lorem, Azier, and Dirjo Harch on Project Swarm. Maela herself had the ability to deploy tens of thousands of probe droids. During her time monitoring various units, she saw all kinds of planets, including deserts, oceans, and jungles. Then, she witnessed a feed from the planet Hoth and saw large metal structures that were generating power. Before she could connect to the droid as to control it, the droid self-destructed and Maela realized that she had found the rebel base. She reported her finding to Harch, it was then reported to the Executor and the base was confirmed to have been discovered. The four left the Swarm processing center to celebrate their success, which Lorem dubbed as Maela's success. Later, Maela continued her search, which included deleting the footage of the planet Dagobah.",
