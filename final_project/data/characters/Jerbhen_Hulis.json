 "content": "Jerbhen Hulis was a male Miraluka Jedi Master who lived during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War.\nDuring the war, he and his Padawan were assigned by the Jedi High Council to investigate Exal Kressh, who had been providing the Republic Military with information on the military movements of the Sith Empire. In 3678 BBY, the two searched for Kressh aboard the Thranta-class corvette Grace of Champalan Tides.\nTheir search eventually led them to Lenico IV. While investigating the planet's surface after the orbital Lenico Colony Blue fell into its atmosphere, Hulis encountered the Sith apprentice Teneb Kel. There, Hulis convinced Kel to aid him in rescuing the surviving colonists on the planet's surface. Shortly after helping Hulis, Kel found Hulis' Padawan and killed him.\nThe last name \"Hulis\" was the family name of Noab Hulis, another Miraluka Jedi Master around the time of the Great Sith War. This was also the maiden name of his daughter Krynda who later took her husband's last name.",
