 "content": "Tal was a female Human quartermaster and agent of Imperial Intelligence who was active during the Galactic War. She could often be found on Vaiken Spacedock, selling gear to other agents.\nTal first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as \"Quartermaster Tal\", a Champion PvP Gear vendor for the Imperial Agent class. During a restructuring of the game's gear system in Game Update 2.0, she was changed to a Basic Gear vendor and retitled as \"Agent Tal.\" She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
