 "content": "Vorli was a male Human who was affiliated with a resistance group that opposed the Cult of Veroleem, a religious sect that ruled the planet Veroleem. At some point, Vorli departed Veroleem to search for some spacers who would be willing to help the resistance to smuggle some recently-liberated victims of the cult off of Veroleem. Vorli suffered some serious injuries during the course of his mission and when he eventually located a group of suitable spacers, he ran toward them and died of his wounds before he could speak with them. A datacard that Vorli had been carrying fell from his hands and was subsequently recovered by the spacers.",
