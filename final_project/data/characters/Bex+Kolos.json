 "content": "Bex Kolos, also known as Gearbox, was a male Human who was a member of Havoc Squad before defecting to the Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Lieutenant Gearbox was the first of Havoc Squad to receive their new member, a promising sergeant newly arrived in Ord Mantell, briefing him in the basics. After their APC walker was shot down by Separatist rockeeters during a separatist attack, he tried to repair the walker but failed, later moving on to Fort Garnik. He was sent on an unknown mission when the sergeant was sent to help out Havoc member Zora, nicknamed Wraith.\nAfter his mission on Ord Mantell, Bex believed that the Republic was becoming too corrupt and decided to defect in joining the Empire along with Harron Tavus. He was later present at the separatists' base when Havoc Squad defected. Prior to his defection, he was the technician for Havoc Squad . When he joined the Empire, Gearbox started \"Project B\" on Alderaan to create a massive assault walker. The trooper pleaded Gearbox to end this and come back to the Republic, but Bex refused and fought against the Havoc captain. He was defeated and finally came to realize that joining the Empire was his true mistake.\nBex Kolos is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Norm Woodel.",
