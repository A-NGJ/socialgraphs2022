 "content": "Davijaan, who flew under the call sign Odd Ball, was a clone commander and pilot, who served as leader of Clone Flight Squad Seven. Odd Ball was commissioned in the Open Circle Fleet during the Clone Wars, and participated in early campaigns such as Teth. He later was given the call sign of \"Red Two\" during the Battle of Coruscant, under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nDavijaan was given the name \"Odd Ball\" by Alpha-17 during his participation in the ARC program.\nIn 22 BBY, he flew a V-19 Torrent starfighter during the Battle of Teth, where he was hit by a vulture droid and fell into panic. But after Obi-Wan Kenobi shot the enemy starfighter down, he regained control of himself and apologized to the general.\nLater in the Clone Wars, Odd Ball served under Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Battle of Umbara. When a battalion of the 501st lead by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex were surrounded by Umbaran militia and forced to retreat off of the ridge, Odd Ball led a squadron of Y-Wing bombers to destroy the ridge and the enemy Umbarans.\nOne year later, Odd Ball was located at a Republic military base on Coruscant when Ahsoka Tano escaped from the base. Under orders from Anakin Skywalker, Odd Ball piloted a Low Altitude Assault Transport after the Jedi Padawan. Odd Ball brought his gunship into a hover over a flight of stairs that Tano was trying to use to get away. The Jedi Padawan, however, managed to jump onto an industrial pipe and cut her way into it, thereby prohibiting Odd Ball and the other pilots to continue the chase.\nDuring the final months of the Clone Wars, Odd Ball flew the Venator-class Star Destroyer Intervention during the Battle of Boz Pity and, with help from Anakin Skywalker, successfully broke through the Separatist blockade in orbit.\nOdd Ball served as Squad Leader of Squad Seven in an ARC-170 starfighter during the Battle of Coruscant, where he and his pilots launched from Ro-ti-Mundi to assist Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though many of his pilots were killed in deadly dogfights with Vulture droid starfighters and droid tri-fighters, Odd Ball's mission was a success, allowing Kenobi time to reach Invisible Hand in time to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.\nOnly days later, he would serve General Kenobi again in the Battle of Utapau as part of the task force sent to the system. However, the result of the conflict was the presumed demise of the Jedi whom he had fought alongside on numerous occasions.\nOdd Ball was portrayed by Temuera Morrison in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. He was voiced in the audio narration of both the Revenge of the Sith novel and Labyrinth of Evil by Jonathan Davis. He appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, played by Dee Bradley Baker. Temuera Morrison voiced Odd Ball in a cutscene of the video game Star Wars: Battlefront II.",
