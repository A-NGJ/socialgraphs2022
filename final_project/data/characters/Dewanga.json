 "content": "Dewanga was a male Dug slaver who worked for Sebolto during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In 32 BBY, he was wanted by Gorga the Hutt for stealing several of Gorga's personal Twi'lek dancers. He was captured by Jango Fett who claimed the bounty.\nDewanga is located in a settlement which has a balcony which has a Dug sniper guarding the door. The settlement contains pictures of Sebulba. This gives the suggestion that he is one of Sebulba's fans and is also possibly the reason why he stole Twi'leks from Gorga the Hutt.",
