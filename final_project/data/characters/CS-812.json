 "content": "CS-812 was a human male stormtrooper who served the First Order during the waning months of the New Republic Era. A member of CS-Squad, CS-812 held the rank of sergeant by the time of his deployment to the Colossus platform, located on the planet Castilon, in the year 34 ABY.\nFollowing the arrival of Commander Pyre, one of CS-812's troopers, CS-515, was impersonated by the Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono. CS-812 became suspicious of Xiono due to the latter's behavior, which was considered unorthodox for a stormtrooper, although he did not suspect that \"CS-515\" was, in fact, an impostor. The squad attempted to apprehend Xiono, but the spy succeeded in switching places with the real CS-515, who was taken into military custody to undergo mental reconditioning.\nCS-812 first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"The New Trooper.\" He was voiced by Stephen Stanton.",
