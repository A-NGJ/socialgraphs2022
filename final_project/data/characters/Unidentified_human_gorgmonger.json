 "content": "A human individual worked as a gorgmonger in Ord Mantell City on the planet Ord Mantell during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the gorgmonger attempted to sell gorgs to the bounty hunter T'onga who declined the offer, but was instead confronted by two Falleen members of the Black Sun criminal syndicate because they operated in the city despite having not paid protection fees. When the gorgmonger informed them they were unable to because business was slow, one of the Falleen informed the gorgmonger that it was their problem and not Black Sun's as the other ate a gorg. The two Falleen were then confronted by members of the Unbroken Clan, who, after a brief exchange, killed the Black Sun members. The gormonger was also killed.",
