 "content": "CT-5108/8843, nicknamed Corr, was a clone trooper munitions disposal specialist who was assigned to a desk job on Coruscant GAR logistics base after he was severely injured by an explosive. He lost both of his lower arms from just above the elbows down, and was waiting for more advanced prosthetic replacements to become available.\nDue to his prosthetic limbs, he developed the habit of sharpening knives on his fingertips, and was known for his tricks with blades, many of which carried the risk of maiming a normal Human.\nCorr assisted Kal Skirata, Omega Squad, Delta Squad, and Null-class ARC troopers Null-7 and Null-11 to eliminate a terrorist cell on Coruscant. During this assignment, he surprised Omega squad with his non-discretion with a Z-6 Rotary Blaster. Impressed by Corr's competence, Skirata decided to train him as a clone commando with the permission of Arligan Zey.\nCorr could have replaced Darman in Omega Squad in order for Darman to accompany Etain Tur-Mukan to Qiilura, but Darman declined the offer.\nWhile training to become a commando, he developed tastes similar to Mereel and would often explore the social scene of cities they visited. Also during his commando training, he worked briefly with Jaing Skirata and Kom'rk.\nLater, he was officially designated as RC-5108/8843 and assigned to Omega Squad to fill the role that RC-8015 had vacated, due to a severe brain injury. He would later be adopted by Skirata, alongside the rest of Omega Squad, making him Corr Skirata.\nWhen the Clone Wars ended he was among the first to desert to Mandalore where they lived in Kyrimorut. He later developed a relationship with Jilka Zan Zentis. His Mandalorian armor colors were red and green.",
