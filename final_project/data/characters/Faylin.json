 "content": "Faylin was a human female who was part of the Free Ryloth Movement during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She piloted Cham Syndulla's ship when they tracked Darth Vader and the Emperor when they were stranded on the surface following the attack and destruction of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Perilous. She also helped Cham, Isval, Kallon, Goll and his team escape when they were attacked by Gutkurrs. After, she tailed behind them as they continued the hunt and when they were surrounded and doomed by a squadron of V-wings, Faylin came to rescue Cham and got him out safely as the others were slaughtered.",
