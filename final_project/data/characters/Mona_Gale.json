 "content": "Mona Gale was a female Human Information broker, operating in the Old World of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. In 3631 BBY she was approached in the by a renegade member of the Knights of Zakuul Senya Tirall, who was looking for information about the Lady of Sorrows. Unwilling to compromise her business with the Lady, Gale only told Senya and the Commander that the Lady occasionally met with the Heralds of Zildrog in Breaktown. After they left, Mona Gale alerted the Lady about the meeting. Shortly thereafter she was approached and killed by the Heralds of Zildrog. Her murder irritated the Lady of Sorrows, who proceeded to kill the leader of the Heralds for his interference.\nMona Gale appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 7: The Lady of Sorrows.",
