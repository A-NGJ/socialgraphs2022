 "content": "Saol-sar was a Twi'lek male merchant who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war, he sold stimulants in the Equipment Requisitions area of the Senate Commercial District, a market located underneath the Senate Plaza on the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant.\nSaol-sar had green skin and eyes, and a darker green pattern of tattoos on his lekku. He wore a blue outfit with a dark belt, gloves, and boots, along with a piece of white cloth around his neck. He spoke Galactic Basic Standard to his customers.\nSaol-sar first appeared in the massively-multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011. His position is marked by a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide for The Old Republic, where he is identified as \"Saol Sar,\" without the hyphen.",
