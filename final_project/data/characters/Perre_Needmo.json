 "content": "Perre Needmo was a male Chevin who hosted a show on Coruscant called The Perre Needmo Newshour, which focused on recent events in the Coruscant area. Needmo was a longtime friend of his director, Jorm Alvic, and was well respected throughout the galaxy for his temperate and balanced reporting.\nThe Perre Needmo Newshour was a favorite program of Han Solo, who regularly tuned in after his granddaughter, Allana Solo, started taking interest in the Chevin's reporting. Solo considered Needmo's show to be a welcome respite from the more biased reporting of Javis Tyrr. Needmo himself considered Tyrr's work to be \"sleemo journalism.\"\nNeedmo's interests soon turned to sentient's rights, and he decided to use his clout with the public to run segments discussing slavery throughout the galaxy circa 44 ABY. Originally, he sent Madhi Vaandt on location to report on slavery, first to Vinsoth, Perre's home planet, and later to Blaudu Sextus. After Madhi's death during the events of the Blaudu Sextus slave revolt, Needmo took it upon himself to interview various beings tied to the slave revolts throughout the galaxy. One such interview, in which Rokari Kem discussed the Qaras slave revolt, was witnessed by Abeloth, who decided to impersonate Kem in order to gain control of the government on Coruscant.\nThe Triumvirate in charge of the GA following Natasi Daala's deposition had great trust in Perre Needmo's professionalism and impartiality. When Luke Skywalker revealed his plans to remove Saba Sebatyne from the Triumvirate - and the New Jedi Order from Coruscant - in 44 ABY, the Triumvirate helped Luke choose Needmo as the newscaster to break the information to the public. Luke did not inform Needmo that he had such important news to relay prior to the interview, and noted with mild surprise that Needmo and his crew were professional enough to take the revelation in stride.\nAfter the escape of the Jedi, Needmo attempted to honor Madhi Vaandt's death by continuing her work on the Coruscant underworld. As newer, more slanted  broadcasting began arising as a result of the upheaval caused by the Jedi exodus, Needmo reminisced about times when Javis Tyrr and his ilk were the least of his worries.\nNeedmo was born on Vinsoth, in the Quelii sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Chevin society had created a slave-based economy reliant upon the suppression of the Chev people. Because slavery was so essential to the world's economic stability, the institution was enforced strictly; those who spoke out against the practice of slavery were often persecuted or even assassinated. This lead many Vinsoth, such as Ephant Mon, to leave the planet. Needmo's natural propensity for honoring life would not allow him to stay on Vinsoth as he aged, and so he left the planet, eventually arriving on Coruscant.\nOn Coruscant, Needmo met his friend, Jorm Alvic. Needmo and Alvic would would be friends for years to come, and the friendship evolved into a partnership when the two decided to create a news program, the extremely popular show The Perre Needmo Newshour. Naming Sima Shadar as the show's director, Needmo and his crew set out to create the most balanced and responsible news team they could.\nBy 43 ABY, journalistic integrity in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances had reached an all-time low. Journalists such as Javis Tyrr were scandalously well-known for ratings-grabbing stunts like Javis Tyrr Presents: The Jedi Among Us, and Needmo was disgusted with the tawdry and irresponsible displays that lead to such programming. Needmo's show was well-known as a responsible balance against such ridiculous displays, and The Perre Needmo Newshour reached new heights of fame and recognition when Perre hired the on-site reporter Madhi Vaandt. Because he was impressed with Vaandt's investigative reporting on the lower levels of Coruscant, Needmo enlisted her for a new segment to his show to uncover the persistence of slavery throughout the galaxy. Slave revolts on various planets arose, seemingly overnight, at the behest of the ominous group, Freedom Flight, and Vaandt began to have communication its members. One such slave revolts, involving the Octusi, lead to Vaandt's death, and Needmo, saddened by the loss of such a good young woman, renewed her segment regarding the Coruscant underworld with renewed vigor.\nPerre Needmo was known for his journalistic integrity and sense of fair play. Some of his viewers, like Han Solo, saw his show as an opportunity to escape from more biased journalists. Others, like Luke Skywalker, showed such faith in his balanced reporting that they trusted The Perre Needmo Newshour with important announcements, such as Luke's decision to remove the Order from Coruscant. Needmo was seen as the happy alternative to his muckraking colleagues, such as Javis Tyrr. As a Chevin, Needmo felt guilty for his people's subjugation of the Chevs, and was instrumental in backing the reports on Galactic slavery that exposed the awful practice. Needmo himself saw his job as a reporter as an important vocation; he behaved with a sense of moral obligation not only to report the news truthfully, but to report even when it might be dangerous or distasteful.",
