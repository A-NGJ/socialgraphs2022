 "content": "Nossit Cicer was a human male who served as major in the Resistance during their war against the First Order. During the attack on the Resistance fleet by the First Order following the evacuation from the planet D'Qar in the year 34 ABY, he served under Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo on the Free Virgillia-class Bunkerbuster Ninka. When the primary bridge of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus was destroyed, killing almost all of Resistance High Command and injuring General Leia Organa, Cicer joined Holdo and several other officers loyal to her in transferring to the Raddus so that the vice admiral could take command of the fleet as the highest ranking officer still able to command.\nWhen all remaining Resistance personnel were ordered onto Resistance transports, Cicer boarded one which contained Poe Dameron and C-3PO. When the First Order launched a bombardment on the fleet, many transports were destroyed. Cicer's transport survived the attack, and the ship arrived safely on Crait. The Battle of Crait quickly ensued, and the Resistance escaped, though not before sustaining many casualties.\nCicer wore a brown brismoss-fiber uniform tunic with dark brown pants, brown boots, and a belt where he holstered a Glie-44 blaster pistol. Cicer's skin was fair in color and his hair was brown and gray.\nNossit Cicer was portrayed by Tim Steed in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. Steed was credited only as \"Amilyn Holdo's officer\" in the film, but received a name in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
