 "content": "Admiral Ers'ikaro of the Chiss Ascendancy's Defense Force was a Chiss flag officer who commanded the Firewolf man-of-war warship Bellicose during a crisis in the Ascendancy around 18 BBY. During the conflict, the flag officer stopped a battle between the Tahmie and Droc families before it could further escalate.\nAround the same year, Ers'ikaro was present in a meeting room where Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn\" was sentenced to exile from the Ascendancy due to his preemptive strikes against various nations. Ers'ikaro, along with four other admirals, delivered the verdict to Thrawn himself. During his exile, Thrawn strongly remembered Ers'ikaro and the other admirals rising from their chairs to announce their decision.\nErs'ikaro was first mentioned, albeit indirectly, in the 2017 novel Thrawn, the first volume of the Thrawn novel series by Timothy Zahn. Ers'ikaro later appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final volume of the Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy Trilogy written by Zahn.",
