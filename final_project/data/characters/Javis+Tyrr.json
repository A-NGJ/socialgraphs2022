 "content": "Javis Tyrr was a Human male journalist during the time following the Second Galactic Civil War. In 43.5 ABY, Tyrr was present in the Temple Precinct when Jedi Knight Jysella Horn—who had just come down with an enigmatic madness—dueled her friends Yaqeel Saav'etu and Bazel Warv. Tyrr recorded the duel and Horn's subsequent capture by Galactic Alliance Security forces. For his highly successful coverage of this event, Tyrr was given his own weekly show, called Javis Tyrr Presents: The Jedi Among Us. He later followed Jaina Solo and Jagged Fel to the Indigo Tower where Lina Zev and Karn Valanti were posing as their doubles. He soon discovered this deception after noticing discrepancies in their voices and the fact that Fel's double didn't have his scar.\nBecause of Tyrr's frequent meddling, Fel created the codename \"Mynock\" to represent the journalist.\nTyrr was present at the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition when Jedi Knight Natua Wan also contracted the Force psychosis. He recorded the resulting chaos, at the same time attempting to pry an interview from Jaina Solo.\nTyrr also managed to obtain information about Seff Hellin's imprisonment inside the Jedi Temple, which he released to the public. This led to a furious statement from Chief of State Natasi Daala and also exposed the secret organization Darkmeld.\nTyrr was despised by many, and some other journalists believed him to be an insult to their profession. When the Trial of Tahiri Veila began, Chief of Staff Wynn Dorvan found out that, during Tyrr's work for Moff Drikl Lecersen, Tyrr had conducted illegal espionage. Using this information, Daala ordered Dorvan to get rid of Tyrr. Tyrr was soon after arrested for illegal espionage.\nHis favorite drink was Créme D'Infame.",
