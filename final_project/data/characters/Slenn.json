 "content": "Slenn was an Imperial Vice Admiral who served under the command of Darth Vader.\nVader had placed Slenn in charge of a military excursion against the Rebel Alliance at the planet Datar. Slenn mobilized his fleet too quickly and the Rebels were alerted to the attack ahead of time. This was a costly mistake that Slenn would pay dearly for.\nThe Imperial forces were technically victorious, since all the Rebels were killed. However, Slenn's forces failed to take any prisoners, which was their primary mission objective. As a result of his failures in leadership, the Vice Admiral was executed by the Emperor's right hand agent, Darth Vader.",
