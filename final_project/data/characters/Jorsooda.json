 "content": "Jorsooda was a Hutt male crime lord who was the chief rival of Karagga the Hutt. Sometime between 3645 BBY and 3640 BBY, Jorsooda had purchased three pet vorantiki and bet that they could kill Karagga's prized rancor, Bonethrasher. The starved and crazed animals were injected with adrenals and released into the pit of Karagga's Palace on the planet Nal Huttaâ€”only to be slain by Bonethrasher within one minute. Karagga rewarded his pet by tossing a surprised Jorsooda into the pit as a flavorful snack.\nJorsooda was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Bonethrasher in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. The Codex entry was added to the game in 2012 as part of Game Update 1.1.",
