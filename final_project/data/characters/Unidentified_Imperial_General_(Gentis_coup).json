 "content": "An Imperial general was held under arrest by Headmaster Gentis during the latter's military coup against Galactic Emperor Palpatine. During his time under Gentis' thumb, Gentis attempted to recruit him into his coup, citing the Imperial Crematorium building as the place where he began to decide to overthrow Palpatine.\nAfter learning about the motives behind Gentis' revolt, he joined the group. He then learned from Gentis the existence of the Death Star was more than rumor via a hologram.\nHe was eventually executed by Palpatine after the latter returned and the coup ended.",
