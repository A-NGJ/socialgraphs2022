 "content": "Mourne Blee was a male Twi'lek, who worked for the company Uniformal Attire during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nBlee worked for Uniformal Attire, a company that specialized in developing commercial uniforms. He wanted to become a fashion designer, so only planned to work for Uniformal Attire until he had saved up enough money to open a fashion house of his own. In 32 BBY, Uniformal Attire developed a new uniform for security staff of the pharmaceutical company Culpharm, so Blee was sent to be Uniformal's representative at the Culpharm Headquarters Building in the city Hedrett.\nBlee disliked working for Uniformal Attire, as he believed that designing uniforms was very mundane and was almost embarrassed by the fact that he worked for them. He was particularly unenthusiastic about the uniform that was developed for Culpharm.",
