 "content": "An Ithorian outcast lived in a settlement of outcasts around 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars. The Ithorian took part in a skirmish on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V against the clone armies of the Galactic Republic. The battle was originally planned to be set against a detachment of clone troopers and their Jedi commander, Joc Sah. The fight suddenly took a different turn, however, when the clone troopers were ordered to execute Order 66; a directive that labeled all Jedi as traitors to the Republic and that they were to be executed immediately. The settlement leader, a Human named Gaan, made peace with Joc Sah, and together with the other settlers they repelled the clone troopers. The Ithorian took his place on a roof with one other outcast for the duration of the skirmish. Once the battle had been momentarily won, the Ithorian and the other outcasts welcomed Joc Sah as one of their own. They then proceeded to counter another force of troopers that arrived to ensure Sah's death.",
