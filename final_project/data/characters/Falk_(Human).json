 "content": "Falk was a young Human who grew up on the streets of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine. As a boy, he befriended the Rodian Doda Bodonawieedo and led Doda into mischievous schemes like stealing ronto barbecue steaks and \"frocking\" the local Jawas. As he grew older, Falk's action became more criminal and he soon gathered a group of like-minded youths around him, forming the Shawpee Gang.\nInitially, the Shawpee gang was content with minor crimes like robbery, muggings, and fighting with rival gangs. Falk and the gang soon turned to more serious crimes, like protection rackets, running numbers and spice, and fencing stolen goods. Eventually Falk and Doda left the Shawpee gang and joined one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's satellite operations, before travelling the Hutt's palace and seeking their fortunes their. While Doda found a niche as the Gamorrean's favorite bard and a regular at the sabacc tables, Falk found work as one of Bib Fortuna's runners. Falk's inquisitive nature proved to be his undoing, as he eavesdropped on a conversation between Fortuna and Jabba. Falk was discovered, and summarily executed.",
