 "content": "R'kik D'nec was a male Jawa from the planet of Tatooine. At some point by the year 4 ABY, D'nec allegedly encountered a tribe of Tusken Raiders, a herd of angry banthas, and a raging krayt dragon in the Dune Sea, and defeated all of them within minutes, emerging from the Dune Sea with a bantha tusk over his shoulder. For this alleged exploit, the Jawa was regarded as the \"Hero of the Dune Sea.\" However, many suspected the legend grew in the telling. D'nec was also undefeated in the game of Dune Sea Sabacc, with no witnesses to the contrary. D'nec wore brown Jawa robes and had yellow eyes.\nR'kik D'nec was first mentioned in 1998, on a couple of cards for the Jabba's Palace Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, R'kik D'nec was named as an anagram of Decipher employee Kendrick Summers. The image Decipher used to represent R'kik D'nec was an edited version of a production photo for scenes in Jabba the Hutt's desert palace from 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi film. However, it is worth noting that the Jawa used to represent R'kik D'nec in the source image was identified as another character, Wittin, in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
