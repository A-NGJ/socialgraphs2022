 "content": "A member of the Grysk species was present at the Sunrise system in 18 BBY. At that time, he was onboard the Grysk warship codenamed \"Bogey One\" by the Chiss officers aboard the Chiss heavy cruiser Springhawk. During a battle there, the Grysk contacted a Nikardun blockade frigate, the Aelos, in reality, a Paccosh-commandeered Nikardun frigate. The Grysk and the \"Nikardun,\" in reality a Paccosh official, Uingali foar Marocsaa, then engaged in a conversation regarding the latter's reasons to be at the system, and the Kilji captain also present at Sunrise, the Paccosh stated that a Navigator had guided them to the system and criticized the Kilji, stating that he was a coward, leaving behind an ally, which faced death during a battle against the Chiss; and they would do if they did not join forces.\nHowever, the Grysk was aware of the Pathfinder, and knew that he could have not guided them to the system, as they were not aware of its existence or location, upon the other captain stating that they were in pursuit by Chiss forcesâ€”which was false, and that the Grysk vessel should prepare for combat, the Grysk threatened the Nikardun with death if they were lying, and added that he hoped not, as the Chiss had taken many Grysk lifes.\nThe Grysk appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final installment of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
