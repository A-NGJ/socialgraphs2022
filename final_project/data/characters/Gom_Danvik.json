 "content": "Gom Danvik was a Rattataki male bounty hunter who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. He supplied other hunters with equipment during the war he and was stationed on board the Vaiken Spacedock space station within the Imperial fleet. Gom Danvik wore a green and yellow set of armor including a helmet, and worked in the supplies section of the station.\nGom Danvik was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he serves as a Basic Gear vendor for the Bounty Hunter class, but with the release of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan, a second version of Danvik was added as a Classic Token vendor in the same room. Both versions were later removed as vendors and NPCs in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
