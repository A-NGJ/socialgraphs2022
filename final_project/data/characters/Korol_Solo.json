 "content": "Korol Solo was a man of Corellian descent who lived on Duro during the decades before the Clone Wars, and who was sometimes identified as great-grandfather to Han Solo.\nKorol claimed to be the great-great-great-great-grandson of Corellia's king, Berethron e Solo, and thus the legitimate heir to the Corellian throne, but he was executed by public hangingâ€”although not before he had fathered at least one son, the notorious pirate Dalla the Black, sometimes cited as Han Solo's grandfather.\nTwo different accounts of Korol Solo are given in The Courtship of Princess Leia. Early in the novel, C-3PO attempts to prove that Han is of royal birth and thus entitled to marry Princess Leia, by revealing that Han is descended from Korol, and thereby the rightful \"King of Corellia\". At the end of the novel, however, Threepio is told by the \"city computer\" that Korol was merely a pretender with no valid claim.\nHowever, the novel does not make it completely clear that this second revelation is the truth, leaving open the possibility that it is misinformation engineered with the connivance of Luke Skywalker, in line with Han's preference to keep his ancestry opaque. Also uncertain is the question of whether Korol's son Dalla Solo was indeed Han's grandfather, who is elsewhere named as Denn Solo.",
