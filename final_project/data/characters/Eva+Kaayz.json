 "content": "Eva Kaayz was a Mirialan female chief operations officer of Czerka Corporation's weapons division during the era of the Galactic War. Before the Seizure of CZ-198, she approached the Imperial Ordnance Acquisition Corps to negotiate terms for information on the classified facility in exchange for an unknown price.\nEva Kaayz was added to the 2011 massively-multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3: Titans of Industry on August 6, 2013. Kaayz functions as the entry point into the Imperial storyline for the moon CZ-198.\nDuring the storyline, Kaayz is a romance option for players of any gender. Players can flirt with her during the introductory conversation, and after the storyline concludes, can choose to share a drink with Kaayz and spend time with her offscreen. After this point, the player can no longer interact with Kaayz or pursue a long-term romance.",
