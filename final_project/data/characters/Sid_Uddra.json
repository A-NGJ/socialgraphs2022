 "content": "Sid Uddra was a female human who served as a loyalty officer in the Imperial Security Bureau and was a mentor of Sinjir Rath Velus. Uddra was a native of Sixmoon in the Velusia system, and during her service at an Imperial Academy, she handpicked Velus for training as a loyalty officer due to his high level of intelligence and aggressive demeanor. Velus was transferred to the ISB's training program at the Viper's Nest on the ocean world of Virkoi. Under Uddra's tutelage, Velus underwent a harsh and violent training program which involved frequent physical combat and stimulated torture sessions. On one occasion, Uddra even broke his toes in order to toughen him up.\nVelus' first assignment as a loyalty officer was to interrogate the Imperial Navy Lieutenant Alster Grove, who was part of a cabal seeking to overthrow Emperor Palpatine by assassinating Darth Vader. Uddra assigned him with rooting out the names of the other conspirators. Under Uddra's direction, Velus tortured Grove for two nights until the man yielded the names of his fellow conspirators. Uddra personally executed Grove by throwing him into the oceans of Virkoi while Vader hunted down and beheaded Grove's co-conspirators.",
