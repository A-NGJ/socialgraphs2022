 "content": "Ormo Haddon was a male Ithorian, who was the Baron Administrator of Cloud City during the reign of Darth Krayt. The new Empire had restricted the sale of tibanna gas to non-government entities, which resulted in many small operations moving out of Cloud City. As a result, it became a darker and more dangerous place. With much of the city abandoned, Ormo Haddon had moved the business and entertaining areas to the center of the city, leaving its outskirts abandoned and completely lawless.",
