 "content": "Corporal Prescott was a Human male Imperial Death Star trooper who served in the detention block guard serving on the first Death Star during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, he volunteered for his prison detail position, as he took sadistic pleasure in seeing Imperial justice enforced.\nHe was present when Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca rescued Princess Leia Organa from her prison cell. Prescott was the third casualty of the battle. After Shann Childsen and Devin Cant were killed, Prescott returned fire and charged against Han Solo, but was subsequently shot in the abdomen and killed by Luke Skywalker.\nPrescott was played by Peter Diamond in A New Hope, but was uncredited for his role.",
