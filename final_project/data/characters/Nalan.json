 "content": "Nalan was an enslaved Twi'lek dancing girl. In 8 ABY she was to be taken to Nal Hutta but was involved in the elaborate scheme by Ghitsa Dogder and Fenig Nabon to scam Durga the Hutt.\nWith her fellow slaves she was transferred through Clan Shak on Ryloth and taken aboard The Fury. When the ship's pilot discovered the Twi'leks were not traveling voluntarily, Dodger and Nabon were sent to Nal Hutta alone by escape pod.\nAfter this, Nalan presented D'ukal with a holo tube requesting them to be taken back to Ryloth and placed under the care of the Dira Clan.",
