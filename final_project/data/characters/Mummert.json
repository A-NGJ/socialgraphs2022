 "content": "Mummert was a male human who served as an admiral in the Galactic Empire. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Lord Darth Vader tasked the admiral with deploying starships in the Hortolo system. However, gathering the proper divisions took longer than expected, and the admiral was unable to fulfill his mission within the deadlines. Mummert reported to Vader on his Star Destroyer, where he was telekinetically choked to death by Vader when he reported the bad news via viewscreen, disturbing the dark lord in his chambers.\nMummert was introduced and killed in \"No Good Deed...,\" a mini-comic that was attached to the first issue of the Star Wars: Darth Vader  comic series.\nIn the space of a single page, Vader refers to Mummert both as a general and an admiral. However, Mummert's involvement with starship deployment pleads in favor of his being an admiral.",
