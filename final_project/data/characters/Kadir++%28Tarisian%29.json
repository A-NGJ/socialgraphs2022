 "content": "Kadir was an elderly male Human who worked as a janitor at the South Apartments on the planet Taris. However, his quality of work was often complained about, although Kadir claimed to do his best with the resources available to him. In 3956 BBY, he encountered Galactic Republic soldiers Revan and Carth Onasi in the South Apartments, telling them about himself and giving them directions to nearby points of interest.\nBorn on the Outer Rim ecumenopolis of Taris, Kadir was an elderly man by 3956 BBY. In his younger years, he enjoyed going to the Upper City Cantina for a drink and to catch up on the latest news, but as he grew older he began to prefer a more solitary lifestyle. Kadir spent most of his time in the South Apartments of the planet's Upper City, where he worked as a janitor. The tenants of the South Apartments constantly complained about the messiness of the building, even though Kadir claimed he did the best he could with the equipment that was available to him. He asked several times for an assistant to help him with his work, but his requests were denied by the owners of the building. He found life in the Upper City decent but was wary of the swoop gangs that were active in the Lower City.\nWhen, in 3956 BBY, Darth Malak's Sith Empire ambushed and destroyed the Galactic Republic cruiser Endar Spire upon its arrival into the Taris system, two Republic soldiers, Revan and Carth Onasi, managed to flee to the surface of Taris in escape pods. After they crash-landed, they began renting an old, unused room in the South Apartments for use as a hideout. The Sith, trying to prevent any surviving Republic forces from leaving, proceeded to capture and quarantine the planet.\nKadir had just finished cleaning the floor of the South Apartments when he was approached by Revan and Onasi. Kadir told the duo about himself, Taris, and his opinion on the Sith, as well as giving them directions to the nearby Upper City cantina and Kebla Yurt's Equipment Emporium. Revan and Onasi eventually left, and Kadir went back to work cleaning the apartments.\nKadir was elderly male Human with blue eyes. As such, he had gray hair and light, wrinkled skin.\nKadir was highly sensitive, but friendly and helpful as long as others respected him and did not use his occupation as a source of insult. Residents living illegally in the apartments did not feel the need to hide their activities from Kadir, as he was perceived to be senile and therefore harmless. As a janitor, Kadir was expected to clean the entire South Apartments alone. He did his best but was unable to complete all of his tasks without an assistant or more advanced equipment, which led to complaints from many of the apartment's tenants.\nKadir was content with his occupation and living standards. He had never left and was not planning to leave his homeworld during the course of his lifetime, and so was unconcerned when the Sith enforced a quarantine in 3956 BBY that banned all starships from entering or leaving Taris.\nKadir appeared as a non-player character labeled in the 2003 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game. There are several dialogue options the player can choose during the conversation. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot or quest, nor does it change the players' alignment.\nWhile dialogue establishes the character's name as \"Kadir,\" they are labeled simply as \"Janitor.\"",
