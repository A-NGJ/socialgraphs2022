 "content": "Nonce was a Radnoran who was in detention most of his life on Radnor. During the Mission to Radnor, when a toxin was released on Radnor, Ruuin, a Radnoran raider who worked for the Avoni, who wanted to invade the planet, claimed that he was paid a wage and a share of the spoils by Nonce. Ruuin also claimed that somebody else hired and gave Nonce access to the official evacuation plans.",
