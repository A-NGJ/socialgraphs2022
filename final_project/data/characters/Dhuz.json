 "content": "Dhuz was a Palandag musician who was part of the house band alongside fellow Palandags Jhat and Hhex for the Canto Casino in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. All three members of the band played f'nonc horn gas bags. While playing at the casino, the musician wore black traditional yekermo outer robes over a brown robe with a golden trim. The Palandag had green skin and black eyes.\nDhuz was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene the musician appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release. Despite this, the character still appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film on December 15, 2017.",
