 "content": "Con'varra was a Twi'lek forger who worked onboard Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport.\nHe was an outcast from his home city on Ryloth and was sold into slavery as a part of his city's tribute to the Sludir slaver Quintik Kahr . When Quintik Kahr's brother Omze'kehr Kahr started his Incredible Traveling Starport he gave him Con'varra as a good luck present. Omze freed the Twi'lek and paid for him to be trained as a slicer and forgery expert. After becoming an expert forger, he returned to Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport and founded Con'varra's Datawork Central, providing quality forgeries and slicing services to visitors with a great system that could duplicate almost any document.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War Con'varra was a suspicious old Twi'lek with a wrinkled face. Since he owed Omze his freedom, Con'varra was steadfast in his loyalty.",
