 "content": "A Twi'lek was a slave present on the planet Zygerria during the Clone Wars.\nSometime around or before 21 BBY, this Twi'lek had become a slave of the Zygerrian Slavers Guild. He was walking across the Zygerrian market when he collapsed due to his heavy bonds. A slaver ordered him up, paying no heed to the Twi'lek's complains about the bonds. The slaver was about to whip the Twi'lek using his shock whip but was stopped by a Jedi Padawan named Ahsoka Tano who was dressed as a slave in order to uncover a mystery.",
