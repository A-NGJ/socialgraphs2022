 "content": "Prit Kessek was a female Clawdite who lived during the time of the Galactic Republic. Kessek was the captain of the transport Skinchanger and she worked for the Zygerrian slavers as a courier. At some point, Kessek was sent to Bazarre, a space station in the Mosu system, to pick up some credits that were to be taken to the planet Zygerria on the behalf of the shipping magnate Brevis Taug. However, Kessek was attacked on the station by a group of agents who were investigating the transfer of Taug's funds, and the agents seized control of the Skinchanger from her.",
