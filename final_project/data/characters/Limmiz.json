 "content": "Limmiz was a male Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a member of the Red Fury Brotherhood, a pirate organization that operated in the Cularin system, and in c. 31 BBY, Limmiz and a group of Brotherhood pirates landed on the asteroid I-9 in the Cularin system asteroid belt. However, the pirates were all driven to insanity by the power of the Darkstaff, a Sith artifact that was located on the asteroid. A short time afterward, the Heroes of Cularin traveled to I-9 while on a mission for the crime lord Nirama, and Limmiz and the other pirates attacked the agents.",
