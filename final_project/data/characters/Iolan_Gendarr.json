 "content": "Iolan Gendarr was a male Human from Commenor who served the Galactic Empire as an officer in the Imperial Navy. Promoted to the rank of captain following the Battle of Hoth, Gendarr was assigned as the commanding officer of the Star Destroyer Reliance. Assigned to protect the Imperial Army training center on Jardeen IV, he fled the Empire along with General Arndall Lott following the Battle of Endor, and the pair formed their own warlord faction.\nIolan Gendarr was born in 37 BBY on the planet Commenor. He joined the Imperial Navy, and served aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Avenger under the command of Captain Lorth Needa. Following the Hoth campaign, Gendarr was promoted and eventually rose to command the Star Destroyer Reliance which was assigned to protect the Imperial Army training center on the planet Jardeen IV. Shortly after the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor, Gendarr abandoned the Galactic Empire along with General Arndall Lott, commander of Walker Operations and Tactics on Jardeen IV. The pair fled the planet before the arrival of New Republic forces.\nGendarr and Lott formed their own Imperial warlord faction as early as six months after Endor, attacking New Republic and civilian targets to secure equipment and supplies. The Star Destroyer Reliance led attacks on New Republic systems, utilizing Scimitar assault bombers in concert with walker ground assaults. The walkers—a mix of All Terrain Armored Transports and All Terrain Scout Transports—were slave-rigged by General Lott's engineers, allowing unpiloted walkers controlled by remote operators to conduct pinpoint strikes on New Republic installations. The New Republic Intelligence Service posted a reward of 75,000 credit for Gendarr's capture on charges of treason, sedition, murder of New Republic personnel, and destruction of New Republic property.\nIolan Gendarr was a Human male who stood 1.75 meters tall. He had a receding hairline and a thin beard that hugged his jawline. A scar ran down the right side of his face from his forehead to his jaw, narrowly missing his eye and bisecting his eyebrow. Gendarr was a competent naval commander and tactician, with specialities in capital ship and starfighter strategies. He was also an intimidating and persuasive individual.\nGendarr was trained to use a blaster, and he had a working knowledge of bureaucratic procedure, along with alien cultures, languages, and star systems. An expert on law enforcement procedures, especially in regard to Imperial law, Gendarr could also plot courses through hyperspace, fly capital ships, operate their weaponry and perform repairs. He was also skilled in the application of first aid and in bypassing security systems.\nCaptain Gendarr wore an Imperial officer's uniform, and carried a datapad and comlink.\nIolan Gendarr was profiled in Wanted by Cracken, a sourcebook for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game published in 1993. The illustration of Gendarr in the book was provided by Mike Vilardi.",
