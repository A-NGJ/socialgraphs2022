 "content": "Bryti was a humanoid male that served as a butler to Jedi Master Kai Hudorra following his acquisition of The Lucky Twi'lek on Kestavel. His wide head was fitted with a Borg Construct Aj^6 headband.\nWhen Dass Jennir, Beyghor Sahdett, and the crew of the Uhumele arrived at the casino in search of Hudorra, the Bothan told Bryti to provide the crew he was not speaking with with accommodations on the house. Following Sahdett's betrayal and subsequent report of Hudorra's Jedi status to the Empire, Bryti, along with several of Hudorra's other servants, reaffirmed that they would stand by him no matter what. Following hatching an assassination attempt on Darth Vader, who was leading the oncoming attack personally, Bryti attended the pre-fight feast, where he served Jennir drugged wine on orders of his master. Hudorra would fall in his fight against Vader, and Jennir would awake aboard the escaping Uhumele, where Bryti gave him a holodisc containing his master's final farewell to his old friend.",
