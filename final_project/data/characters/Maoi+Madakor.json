 "content": "Maoi Madakor was a human female who served as a captain in the Judicial Forces during the reign of the Galactic Republic. In 32 BBY, she piloted the Consular-class space cruiser Radiant VII with co-pilot Antidar Williams to the Naboo system in order to deliver the Jedi ambassadors Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nThe two Jedi aimed to negotiate an end to the Trade Federation's blockade of the planet Naboo. Upon reaching the blockade, Madakor landed the cruiser on the Federation flagship, the Saak'ak, so that the Jedi could meet with Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. After the Jedi disembarked the Radiant VII, it was destroyed by a Federation droid laser turret, killing Madakor and Williams.\nMaoi Madakor was a human female who served in the Judicial Forces as captain of the Radiant VII, a Consular-class space cruiser belonging to the Diplomatic Corps of the Galactic Republic. In 32 BBY, the Trade Federation blockaded the planet Naboo over a trade dispute. In response, Madakor was tasked with transporting the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to the Naboo system so that they could negotiate an end to the blockade on behalf of Republic Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum.\nMadakor piloted the Radiant VII alongside fellow Judicial Antidar Williams, and, upon arriving in the Naboo system, they headed toward the Trade Federation flagship, the Saak'ak. On Jinn's orders, Madakor contacted Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray to let him know that they wished to board at once, and she then landed the cruiser within one of the Federation starship's hangar bays. After the Jedi left the vessel to begin negotiations, Madakor and Williams remained in the cockpit and awaited their return.\nAfter receiving orders from his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Gunray gave the command for the Republic ambassadors to be killed, and a droid laser turret descended from the ceiling of the hangar bay. Antidar spotted the turret and warned Madakor, who began giving an order to raise the Radiant VII's shields, but before she could finish the order, the cruiser was destroyed, resulting in the deaths of both pilots. Jinn and Kenobi managed to avoid their would-be executioners and escaped the Saak'ak, eventually aiding the people of Naboo in defeating the Federation.\nMaoi Madakor had brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nMadakor was wearing a blue Judicial Forces uniform at the time of her death.\nMaoi Madakor was portrayed by Bronagh Gallagher in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. All of the scenes taking place in the cockpit of the Radiant VII were filmed on September 8, 1997. In the new Star Wars canon, the character's name was first used in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, the character first appeared in the novelization of The Phantom Menace, which was written by Terry Brooks and released prior to the film.\nWhile her surname was first used on a card in the 2001 Coruscant Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, Madakor's first name first appeared in the 2002 magazine The Official Star Wars Fact File 33. In the original script for the film, Madakor's final line is not \"Shields up!\" but instead \"No! Warnâ€¦,\" and in a rough cut of the film, it was recorded as \"Warn the Jedi!\"",
