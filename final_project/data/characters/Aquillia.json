 "content": "Aquillia was a female Twi'lek archaeologist who lived during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, she was studying the culture of the Rak'qua, a Nautolan tribe that inhabited Station Gamma, an asteroid-carved space station in the Bright Jewel system. During her stay on the station, she discovered that the Rak'qua worshiped ancient altars, dancing around them and hoping that their wisdom will bring them protection and prowess in battle. As the Nautolans were rather hostile with strangers, Aquillia once tasked a group of spacers with exploring the depths of Station Gamma and surveying eight sacred runes from Rak'qua altars. The spacers had to fight several Rak'qua but they succeeded in their mission, bringing reproductions of the runes to Aquillia.\nAquillia appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Aquillia was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
