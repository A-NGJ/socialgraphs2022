 "content": "A clone trooper served the Galactic Republic's Grand Army during the Clone Wars. He once served on a planet, where he was designated to Post 473 by his superiors. The clone was tasked with destroying a bridge in order to hinder a Separatist droid convoy from crossing over and conquering a mining colony. The rockets for his missile launcher were stolen by a couple of the native creatures, forcing the soldier to pursue them. As a result, the clone trooper went through a series of mishaps, but he was able to achieve his goal of destroying the bridge when he located the rockets near one of the the bridge's supports and shot them with his blaster pistol as the droid forces were crossing over. As the clone attempted to pack his gear, the creatures stole the missile launcher, forcing him to pursue them once more.\nA Human clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, hailing from the planet Kamino, served the Galactic Republic as a clone trooper in the Grand Army during the Clone Wars, which was initiated on the Outer Rim world Geonosis in 22 BBY. At some point during the war, the trooper was designated to Post 473 on a world, where he was positioned atop a cannon overlooking a bridge and ordered by his commander to await the Separatist Droid Army, which was due to arrive in three hours. With Republic reinforcements delayed, the lone trooper was the only resistance that the droids would face on their way to a nearby mining colony. He was tasked with destroying a bridge across the canyon, halting their advance.\nHe began to adjust the alignment of his rocket launcher, but the trooper was interrupted by one of the local creatures stealing the rockets for the cannon. The creature took the rockets and darted into a nearby hole. The clone followed the creature and took back his rockets, only to find that the tunnel was not stable enough to support his weight. The creature fled, leaving the clone—still clutching the rockets—to fall into a subterranean lake, where he equipped a rebreather so that he could survive under the surface. As soon as he reacquired the rockets, the clone was attacked and swallowed by a massive underwater creature. However, he managed to shoot a hole in the creature's stomach and swim his way out. Freed from its belly, he was subsequently swept away by the underground current.\nNoticing that there was a waterfall up ahead, the clone attempted to cling onto a rock but was soon found by the same creature as before. The creature banged on the clone's hands with another rock, causing him to lose his grip. The trooper fell over the waterfall, only to land safely and find himself at the base of the bridge he was meant to destroy. He then saw that the Separatists were in the middle of their crossing, and also located the rockets at the bottom of one of the bridge's support beams. Thinking quickly, the clone used his blaster pistol and shot the rockets, causing them to detonate, resulting in the bridge exploding and collapsing, and destroying the droid army. Wet and tired, the trooper returned to his previous station, ready to pack up the cannon and move on to his next assignment. However, the small creatures from before then darted in front of him, stealing the cannon and running away. The clone chased after the two creatures once more.\nThe clone trooper expressed frustration when the two creatures made off with his equipment. Nevertheless, he was determined to find the rockets, and he found a way to complete his goal of destroying the bridge without using the cannon he originally intended to use. He wore Phase I clone trooper armor with red markings and was equipped with a blaster pistol and a rebreather. The clone had the same physical characteristics as Jango Fett; the trooper had black hair that was parted by a line, brown eyes, and tan skin. He also stood 1.83 meters.\nThe clone trooper first appeared in the short story Waiting, which was one of four stories in the tenth volume of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures trade paperbacks. He was created and drawn by Matthew and Shawn Fillbach.",
