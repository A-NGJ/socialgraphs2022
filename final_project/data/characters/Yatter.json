 "content": "Yatter was an Ithorian who lived on Dorumaa. He worked for the Dorumaa Ecological Renovation Team and would spend his days researching and investigating Dorumaa's various species of flora and fauna. He was good friends with the Gamorrean Wuglik and they would often meet up to watch sport together. On one occasion, they were playing Bannak and watching the Galactic lightball playoffs on a holovid in the Cantina Oceana when Echari Di'San got into a fight with Rysko Barnt. Barnt was murdered shortly after and Yatter was asked some questions about the incident by some spacers who had been hired by the Cularin Trade Alliance to investigate the death. Yatter thought that it was obvious that Di'San had killed Rysko.",
