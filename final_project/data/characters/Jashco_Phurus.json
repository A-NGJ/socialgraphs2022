 "content": "Jashco Phurus was a human male pirate who prowled the Arrowhead Region of the galaxy east of the planet Coruscant. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Phurus was standing next to the wall opposite the entrance to Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana when the smuggler Han Solo entered with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8. Shortly after their entrance, many of the castle's patrons, Phurus included, rushed outside to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon, after which First Order forces attacked and destroyed Kanata's castle. After the First Order attack, Phurus joined the Resistance alongside another smuggler after Maz Kanata introduced them to General Leia Organa.\nWhile at the castle, Phurus wore red Tricorraan raider robes and carried a field-accelerated blaster rifle. He had dark skin and shaved black hair.\nJashco Phurus first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. He was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. Phurus was played by Daniel Adjei in the film. Phurus was voiced by Dorian Lockett in Choose Your Destiny: A Maz's Castle Mission.",
