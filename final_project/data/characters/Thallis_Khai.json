 "content": "Thallis Khai was a male Human born on the remote Wild Space world of Kesh in the years before the Galactic Civil War. A member of the planet's Lost Tribe of Sith, Khai was the father of Sith Saber Gavar Khai and the grandfather of Sith apprentice Vestara Khai.\nThallis Khai was a male Human born in the time before the Galactic Civil War. A native of the remote Wild Space planet Kesh, he was a member of the Lost Tribe of Sith—descendants of a group of Sith who had crash-landed on the planet in 5000 BBY after being ambushed and knocked off-course during a hyperspace jump in their warship, the Omen.\nAround the time of the Galactic Civil War, Khai fathered a Force-sensitive son named Gavar. Gavar trained with the Tribe in the ways of the dark side of the Force, earned the rank of Sith Saber, and married a non–Force-sensitive woman, Lahka Khai, with whom he had one daughter, Vestara, in 27.5 ABY, making Thallis Khai a grandfather. In 41.5 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Vestara was brought before the Tribe's ruling council, the Circle of Lords, after her encounter with the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship. The Tribe's Grand Lord, Darish Vol, greeted her as the daughter of Gavar Khai and granddaughter of Thallis Khai.\nThallis Khai was first mentioned in author Christie Golden's debut Star Wars novel, Fate of the Jedi: Omen, the second of nine novels in the Fate of the Jedi series, released on June 23, 2009. In the novel, Khai was mentioned only as the father of Gavar Khai, leaving his Force-sensitivity in question.",
