 "content": "Grindol Maal was an ex-pirate with Rebel sympathies.\nMaal was a close friend with the Revwien Wuwuhuul. Together, they volunteered to aid the Rebellion on a mission to the planet Goratak III. The Rebellion was trying to capture a I2-CG droid that had crashed on the planet. The droid contained highly sensitive information on a Rebel starfighter manufacturing plant on Tar Morden.\nMaal was joined by the Red Smoke, Safari One and Buzz Boys squads. The 30 troops in total fought against 15 Imperial troops and a group of bounty hunters led by Feskitt Bobb. They clashed in the middle of a crystal forest, with the outcome of the battle unknown.\nMaal was always eager to fight against the Empire, and was often armed with a blaster rifle and a vibrocutlass.",
