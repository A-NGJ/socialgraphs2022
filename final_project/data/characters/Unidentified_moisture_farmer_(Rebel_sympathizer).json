 "content": "An unidentified moisture farmer who was a sympathizer of the Rebel Alliance lived on Tatooine at some point during the Galactic Civil War. A male of the Human species, he owned a moisture farm north-east of the city of Mos Eisley. The farmer kept an Optical Information Crystal that contained vital clues regarding the location of hidden droid factory, and he agreed to give it to a Rebel agent in exchange for repairing a few damaged water pipes. Some of those pipes were covered with corrosion, which prevented the farmer from either selling water to the traders or even irrigate his crops. When the Rebel agent's droid arrived at the farm, the pipes' state of deterioration was so severe that it threatened to end the farmer's career.",
