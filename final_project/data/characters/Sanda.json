 "content": "Sanda was a female Human criminal who, together with Lemo, led a gang of thugs. She had ginger-colored hair.\nWhen Sanda got stuck with the other gang members on planet Arcan IV in 3 ABY, she expressed her regret that her former partner Han Solo had fallen into the hands of bounty hunter Boba Fett. However, she only felt sorry for this, because she herself would have liked to receive the premium that had been released on Solo. At that time, Sanda, Lemo, and their people were planning a very lucrative raid, to which, however, they needed the Dancing Goddess and the Mistrel. After months of searching for these two statues in vain, frustration spread through them. A solution to their problem appeared to emerge when a man introduced himself as Captain Drebble, claiming that Han Solo might be helpful in finding the two figures. In reality, however, he was Lando Calrissian, who posed for his old enemy Barpotomous Drebble and wanted to elicit information from the criminals about the whereabouts of his lost friend. He also succeeded, but he also accidentally revealed his true relationship with Solo. Sanda, Lemo and their people then tried to assassinate Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca, who escorted him, but the two could seize a glider and flee. This was ended by a traffic accident. So they were asked by a gang member named Dafi. It turned out that Calrissian had the Mistrel with him. In fact, he had won both statues some time earlier in a card game. When Sanda, Lemo and the others arrived, Dafi turned and opened the fire on them, because she did not want to share the Mistrel with anyone. Sanda and Lemo got away with their lives and could bring the Mistrel, but Calrissian and Chewbacca managed to escape in the meantime.\nShortly after the battle of Endor, Sanda, Lemo and their gang, still searching for the Dancing Goddess, met on the planet Keyorin on Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca and the real Drebble. Sanda and Lemo managed to catch Solos and Chewbaccas. In their hiding place, they interrogated their prisoners to find out where the Dancing Goddess was. Solo claimed that Drebble was the one who owned the coveted statue. Sanda, Lemo, and most of their people went to the spaceport, because Drebble was staying aboard his ship, Cobra, with his men and his old enemy Calrissian. However, they fell into a trap that Drebble and Calrissian had put together. In the meantime, he had succeeded in persuading him to cooperate. When she realized that she and yours had been encircled by Drebble's people and there was no escape for them, Sanda decided to surrender. In the end, she and Lemo watched Calrissian Drebble hand over the Dancing Goddess.",
