 "content": "Edon Kappehl was a fair-skinned human male who served in the Resistance during their war against the First Order. During the evacuation of the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar in the year 34 ABY, he flew as the bombardier for Crimson Hailstorm, a MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 bomber serving in Crimson Squadron. He was killed above D'Qar along with the rest of the squadron during an attack run on the First Order's Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, when a burning enemy fighter crashed into the bomber he was on, starting a chain reaction and destroying the bomber.\nEdon Kappehl first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. He was portrayed by actor Dan Euston. The character was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Incredible Cross-Sections, a reference book written by Jason Fry and released in conjunction with the film.",
