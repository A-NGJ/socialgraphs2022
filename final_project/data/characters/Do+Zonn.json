 "content": "Do Zonn was a male Zabrak Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Zabrak, Do Zonn was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, serving as a Jedi Knight following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire. Zonn was stationed on the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. While still a Padawan, Zonn had traveled into the ruins of the fortress city Kaleth and had a brief encounter with the dark side of the Force. Redeeming himself in the eyes of the Jedi High Council, Zonn was made a Knight and appointed as the defender of the ruins where he advised other Jedi who traveled within. Though studying from afar, Jedi Zonn was able to gather significant data on the Chamber of Speech, an ancient cavern hidden in the hills in upper Kaleth.\nDo Zonn appears in the mission \"Chamber of Speech\" in the 2011 BioWare game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
