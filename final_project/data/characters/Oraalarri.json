 "content": "Oraalarri the Elder was an albino Wookiee who sought to spread the ideals of Life Day. He was an elder within his four person family.\nDuring the Life Day festivities of 1 ABY, Oraalarri resided on Endor and on Yavin 4 with his family. Kkatamik sent a number of spacers to visit Oraalarri and his family so that they could learn more about the festival. His family included Anarra, Radrrl and Tebeurra.\nOraalarri would have the celebrants speak to his family. As a sign of goodwill, Oraalarri offered Life Day celebrants a painting.\nOraalarri the Elder was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. During the Life Day event of 2004, players could talk to Oraalarri on either Endor or Yavin 4. Oraalarri would then have the players speak to the rest of his family to learn about Life Day. Once the player's learned everything they could, Oraalarri would give the player a random Life Day painting.",
