 "content": "Khiss was a hulking Dug mercenary and friend of Sebulba.\nIn 32 BBY, Khiss assisted Sebulba in the hunting of several Ghostling children who had escaped Gardulla the Elder. Along with Sebulba, Djas Puhr and Gondry, he tracked the children and their slave helpers to Gardulla's pleasure gardens.\nPala distracted the Dug into chasing her through the garden, and she narrowly avoided the snare of a carnivorous Deneba bush. Unfortunately, Khiss did not notice the danger until it was too late, and was eaten whole by the bush before he could so much as scream.",
