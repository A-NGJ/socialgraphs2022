 "content": "Lieutenant Theomet Danlé was a human male member of the Naboo Palace Guard who served on board the J-type diplomatic barge of Senator Padmé Amidala. He was on board when it traveled to the planet Coruscant in 22 BBY so that she could vote in the Military Creation Act, but he was killed in an explosion when the barge was destroyed in an unsuccessful attempt on Amidala's life.\nTheomet Danlé was a human male who served as a lieutenant in the Naboo Palace Guard, a part of the security forces of the Royal House of the planet Naboo. In 22 BBY, he was among the crew assigned to the J-type diplomatic barge of Senator Padmé Amidala, who used the vehicle to travel to the planet Coruscant in order to vote on the Military Creation Act in the Galactic Senate. Amidala's Head of Security, Captain Gregar Typho, feared that returning to Coruscant might put the senator in danger, so Amidala disguised herself as a pilot and flew in one of the N-1 starfighters escorting the barge while her handmaiden Cordé took her place as a decoy.\nAs the barge arrived above Corsucant, Danlé and a Security Guard trooper approached Cordé and informed her that they were making their final approach. The barge and its escort then landed on one of Coruscant's landing platforms, and Cordé began to disembark down the ship's ramp. However, Typho's fears proved correct, for a bomb planted by the assassin Zam Wesell detonated before the decoy could reach the bottom of the ramp. Danlé, Cordé, and several others were killed by the explosion, although Amidala survived the attempt on her life.\nTheomet Danlé had black hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nDanlé wore a dark red version of the armor of the Palace Guard, including the helmet, and had a matching belt on which he carried a S-5 blaster pistol and a comlink with an extendable antenna.\nTheomet Danlé was portrayed by Steve John Shepherd in the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The character was credited only as \"Naboo officer\" in the film and in the current Star Wars canon was identified by name in the \"Starship Fact File\" department of the Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon magazine's fifty-fifth issue, which was written by Tim Veekhoven and published around January 20, 2016 The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was created by user \"winstonvalleyjedi\" as part of the character's backstory through StarWars.com's Hyperspace feature \"What's The Story?,\" which ran from 2005 to 2008.",
