 "content": "A Yalbec queen came into conflict with the Galactic Republic's Clone Force 99 while they were on Yalbec Prime, putting down an insurrection during the Clone Wars. Wrecker, a member of Clone Force 99, cut off the Queen's stinger while she was still alive, causing several Yalbec males to try and mate with the clones. The clones managed to survive the encounter and traveled to the planet Anaxes for their next mission, where the force's leader Hunter told the clones Cody, Jesse, Kix and Rex about their encounter with the Queen.\nThe Queen was first mentioned in \"The Bad Batch\", an episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. The episode was written to be the premiere for a planned seventh season, but The Clone Wars was canceled before it was finished or released. The unfinished story reels of the episodes were then shown at Celebration Anaheim in 2015, before being released on StarWars.com later that year as part of The Clone Wars Legacy.",
