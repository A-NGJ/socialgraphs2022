 "content": "Ha'adj was a Human female mercenary who lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War. She was a member of the Azure Cabal, a mercenary organization led by Loruna Scathe that operated on many planets of the galaxy. In 1 ABY she was stationed in Kor Vella on Corellia, where she tracked the activities of several rival mercenary groups like the Drennics. When their actions impeded the Cabal, Ha'Adj dispatched a muscle to fix the situation.\nHa'adj was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
