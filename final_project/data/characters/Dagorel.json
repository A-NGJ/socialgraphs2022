 "content": "Dagorel was a male Quarren criminal who lived on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Dagorel was employed by the Hutt crime lord Borvo as his main lieutenant. In 1 ABY, Dagorel participated to an important illegal weapon sale near Moenia. However, the sale was in fact an undercover police operation of the Corellian Security Force and all Borvo's men but Dagorel were killed or arrested during the operation. The Quarren luckily escaped but was shot in the ambush and severely injured. When the rest of the gang discovered the situation, Borvo's bodyguard sent a spacer with medicine to rescue Dagorel in the Paitnnu Wetlands, and thus saved his life. Dagorel later discovered that he was trapped during that mission by one of Borvo's most trusted men known as Niksel Frangee. The spacer who saved Dagorel was thus tasked to assassinate Frangee. Borvo's guard, Dagorel and the spacer finally found that Frangee was an infiltrated agent of the Corellian Security Force. Dagorel later discovered that Frangee entered Borvo's organization thanks to one of Borvo's former business partner known as Montrus.\nDagorel appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nDagorel was present in the original release of the game, being part of Borvo the Hutt's questline. With the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005, Borvo the Hutt's questline was revamped. While the gameplay of the questline was extensively upgraded, the storyline remained similar. With this update, Dagorel had his appearance changed from a Rodian to a Quarren.",
