 "content": "Iris was a union leader for Corellian Engineering Corporation workers. She and several of her fellow leaders met with Wedge Antilles after the Galactic Empire promulgated labor laws that they found unsatisfactory. While they agreed to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Iris argued against doing so. Once the decision was made, she resolved to sell out the others to the Empire. The other leaders, fearing that she would do such a thing, tipped off Antilles, who sent an agent to reason with her. She instead attacked the agent, who killed her.",
