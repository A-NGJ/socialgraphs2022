He commonly attended the Theta-class T-1 vessel Victory, the personal shuttle of Darth Zannahâ€”whom he knew as \"Allia Omek\". He also knew her Master, Darth Bane; although he believed Bane to be \"Sepp Omek\", Allia's brother. Chet was later killed by Darth Zannah. He was survived by his widow.",
