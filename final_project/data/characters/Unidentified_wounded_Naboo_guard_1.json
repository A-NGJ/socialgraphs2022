 "content": "A male Human guard of the Royal Naboo Security Forces was wounded during the Invasion of Naboo in the year 32 BBY. He was wounded after the Trade Federation entered the city of Theed, the capital of the planet Naboo. He and another guard took cover from the B1-Series battle droids in the gardens near the Theed Royal Palace.\nThe Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi met this guard when the Jedi was trying to enter Theed. Kenobi talked to this guard, and asked for the codes to enter the area near the Palace. The guard gave Kenobi the code: J-154. The three were then attacked by more battle droids, but Kenobi destroyed the attackers and continued his mission.\nThis guard appears in the 1999 adaptation of the Episode I movie. The player, taking the role of Kenobi, may meet this guard during the course of the game's fifth mission. The player can talk to the guard using several dialogue options and can also choose to ignore the guard. If the player chooses the latter option, he can talk to another guard, who will open the door. This article assumes the player chose to talk to the guard. In the credits, Greg Burson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #1\" while Nick Jameson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #2.\" It is unclear who voices this character. The guard and another guard have an entry in the characters overview in the start of the game's strategy guide.",
