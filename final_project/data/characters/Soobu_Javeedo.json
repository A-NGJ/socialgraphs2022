 "content": "Soobu Javeedo was a male Rodian spice dealer who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he worked for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. In 1 ABY, Javeedo was found to peddle his wares in the territory of Lady Valarian, the leader of the Valarian Syndicate and main rival of Jabba. Lady Valarian therefore tasked spacer with eliminating the spice dealer. The spacer eventually found Soobu Javeedo and two Desert Banshee swoopers near Mos Eisley and killed them in the ensuring firefight.\nSoobu Javeedo was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Soobu Javeedo was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nBecause Soobu Javeedo spawned under the generic \"tough_thug_male_rodian\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of eight possible depictions and would fluctuate after each server reset. Nevertheless, he systematically appeared as a Rodian and quest dialogues identified him as a male.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Soobu Javeedo was consequently removed from the game.",
