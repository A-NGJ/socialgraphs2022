 "content": "Gurnot was a Gamorrean male enforcer for the criminal Ivax Syndicate. He provided training for the smuggler Riley's sibling on the planet Burnin Konn.\nThe Gamorrean male Gurnot was an enforcer for the criminal Ivax Syndicate. During the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, Gurnot and his associate Nogba Quush met with the smuggler Riley and her young sibling at Konn-Nevos Spaceport on the planet Burnin Konn within the blockaded sector. The siblings were associated with the criminal Trade Spine League, but Quush had no interest in interfering with their relationship to the League and so told Gurnot he could not kill the pair. Quush and Riley came to an agreement where they would help each other in eliminating or threatening several troublesome individuals. Quush and Gurnot would provide the siblings with training, transport and targets, while Riley's sibling would attack the targets.\nGurnot first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Uprising, which was released to mobile platforms in 2015. In the game, he acts as a trainer for the enforcer class and also has some minor involvement in the game's main story.",
