 "content": "Commander Dreyf was an Imperial Intelligence officer who served aboard the Star Destroyer Chimaera in 19 ABY.\nLoyal to Supreme Commander, then-Fleet Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, Dreyf was tasked with investigating the misappropriation of funds in the records of the planet Muunilinst concerning Moff Vilim Disra, Lord Graemon , and General Jaron Kyte.\nDreyf later escorted Pellaeon to Disra's palace on Bastion in order to confront the Moff concerning the misappropriated funds, which were found to have been channeled to the Cavrilhu Pirates. While in Disra's office, Dreyf acted under Pellaeon's orders and successfully broke into the Moff's desk, uncovering datacards with files that implicated Disra in many crimes against the Empire for which the corrupt politician would soon be arrested.",
