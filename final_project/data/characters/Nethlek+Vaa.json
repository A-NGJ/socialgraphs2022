 "content": "Nethlek Vaa was a male Rutian Twi'lek informant who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Nethlek Vaa was asking for an outrageous sum of credits in return for the information that he gave to Imperial Wilhalm Skrim. Wilhalm was very annoyed by the Twi'lek's persistence and instructed a spacer to track him down. Nethlek Vaa was seen being guarded by two Rebels until all three were killed by the spacer.\nNethlek Vaa was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
