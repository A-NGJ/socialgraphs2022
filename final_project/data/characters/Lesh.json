 "content": "Lesh was a young male Korun rebel and the brother of Besh. Lesh had an addiction to thyssel bark, which stained his teeth and infected him with fever wasps around the time that Mace Windu arrived on Haruun Kal during the Summertime War. Nick Rostu suggested killing Lesh to prevent the spread of the wasps and to spare him further pain, but Mace Windu did the killing himself. However, Lesh's execution did not prevent the spread of the wasps, as they had spread to Chalk and Besh as well.",
