 "content": "Reina March was a female patron of the Outlander Club on Coruscant when the bounty hunter Zam Wesell was captured by Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. March was found in the presence of Whimper Save and Dannl Faytonni.\nReina March was the leader of anarchist organization called Edge-9. Edge-9 claims the destruction of the Coruscant government and abolition of aristocracy and was known for appealing its political demands with violent means. Of course, not all members actively supported violence, but the behavior of Edge-9 also included bombing terrorism against multipurpose facilities such as police. The anarchist of Edge-9 planned the blast of the Senate Building in the past, and secretly plotted a bomb along the pipeline extending from the extreme point, but this plan failed.\nMarch was a particularly radical faction within the organization, involved in the planning and execution of numerous violent acts. Even after the new order was enforced, the organization had survived, but the members gradually became less and, on the other hand, changed into a more fanatic group.",
