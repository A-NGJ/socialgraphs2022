 "content": "Bok was a Kajain'sa'Nikto Morgukai warrior from Kintan.\nIn 30 BBY, he, his father Tsyr, and Kh'aris Fenn were used by Count Dooku in his plan to stage a coup on Ryloth. During a battle with Jedi Knight Aayla Secura, he lost his arm and feigned his death. He had his hand replaced with a cybernetic one.\nA decade later, Count Dooku invited Bok to be the source of genetic material for a clone army of Morgukai. The Count promised that the Morgukai would be resurrected on Saleucami and trained by Anzati; Bok accepted. Unfortunately for his cause, the Republic got wind of the army and sent three battalions to avert the growing threat that Saleucami now posed.\nBok saw his chance for revenge when he spotted Aayla Secura during the Outer Rim Sieges. His cortosis gauntlet rendered her lightsaber useless. However, when he engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, she quickly bested him without breaking a sweat, despite being a third his size. Exhausted and humiliated, Bok tried again and again to fell the Twi'lek Jedi, each time being beaten down by powerful kicks and blows. Aayla retorted that he had disappointed his father's ghost. Bok became furious that the Jedi insulted him and charged, but Aayla Force-pushed Bok against a laser gate, killing him.",
