 "content": "Maverse Pontilo was a Human male businessman from Balmorra who supported the Sith Empire during the Cold War. He was the manager and founder of Pontilo Foundation.\nLiving on Balmorra, Maverse and his family lived peacefully until the Sith Empire invaded their homeworld. As a pragmatic man, Pontilo gave immediate support to the Imperial occupation forces. He then was sentenced to death by the Republic, but his family were accidentally killed by Lancer Squadron instead of him. After this personal tragedy, he traveled to the Markaran Imperial Outpost to seek sanctuary.\nIn 3643 BBY, he tasked an Imperial spacer to help him find the Republic squad responsible for the death of his family, and retrieve their ID tags.",
