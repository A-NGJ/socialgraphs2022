 "content": "Tritt Opan was a male human who served in the naval forces of the First Order. Holding the rank of captain, he was among the staff of General Armitage Hux, and acted as his hitman to kill anyone who might pose a threat to the general, with some of his devices including a fake code cylinder that contained poison. Owing to his knowing about and being involved in these assassinations, he also kept firmly silent about this, knowing full well that Hux could silence him in the future if he decided so.\nOpan was portrayed by Patrick O'Kane in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.",
