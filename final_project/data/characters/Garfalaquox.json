 "content": "Garfalaquox was an Aqualish don who operated on Tatooine. After the bounty hunter Boba Fett took over the palace and criminal empire of Jabba the Hutt, Garfalaquox visited the palace to pay tribute to the new crime lord. The Aqualish brought Fett a chest of credits as a gift, addressing him and his partner, the Master Assassin Fennec Shand, before departing.\nGarfalaquox appeared to accept Fett as the new Daimyo, when in actuality he had joined the other dons in a deal with the Pyke Syndicate to help the Pykes in their attempt to drive Fett from Mos Espa. While soldiers of the Aqualish family took part in the battle, Garfalaquox took refuge at the Pykes' headquarters at the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine, alongside the other two family leaders and Mayor Mok Shaiz of Mos Espa. With Fett driving the Pykes out of the city, negotiations with the Pyke boss were interrupted when Shand carried out the assassination of the conspirators, killing Garfalaquox first.\nThe Aqualish Garfalaquox was the don of the Aqualish family at the city of Mos Espa on the desert planet Tatooine. Additionally, he served as a captain in the criminal empire of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Following Jabba's death in 4 ABY, his majordomo Bib Fortuna laid claim to his empire, prompting Garfalaquox to pull his family out of the crime family, the leaders of the Trandoshan family and Klatooinian family also doing so. Mos Espa was split between the families, the Aqualish controlling the Worker's District. Fortuna relied on uneasy alliances with Garfalaquox and the other two leaders, each of them attempting to overthrow the former majordomo to no avail.\nAround 9 ABY, Boba Fett, a famed bounty hunter who had chosen to move on from his former career, murdered Fortuna. Fett subsequently took control of Jabba's palace as the new Daimyo, attempting to rebuild the remnants of his empire. After Fett took up residence in the palace, Garfalaquox was among those who visited to pay tribute to the new crime lord. The Aqualish entered the palace's throne room, addressing Fett and his accomplice, Master Assassin Fennec Shand. Presenting Fett with a chest of credits, Garfalaquox made a statement about friendship before handing the credits to the 8D-series smelter droid 8D8. Garfalaquox bowed to Fett before turning and leaving the palace; however, neither Fett nor Shand had been able to fully understand the Aqualish's language, with Fett noting that they needed a protocol droid.\nWith the Pyke Syndicate gathering troops in Mos Espa with the support of Mayor Mok Shaiz, Fett gathered Garfalaquox and the other two family leaders for a banquet. After Shand summarized the power struggle following the fall of Jabba the Hutt, Fett warned the dons of the Pyke's takeover on Tatooine. When the head of the Klatooinian family suggested that they could make their own claim on the title of Daimyo by killing Fett, the were guests startled by a roar from Fett's rancor, which resided beneath the throne room where the meeting was held. After Fett invited the leaders back to their seats. Garfalaquox questioned what the Daimyo was proposing, 8D8 translating his words.\nFett thus proposed an alliance between the families against the Pyke Syndicate. The Daimyo's request did not set well, as the Klatooinian don protested against it, with agreement from Dokk Strassi, the Trandoshan family leader. Fett therefore asked that the leaders instead remained neutral in his feud with the Pykes. The family leaders conversed with their associates, and Garfalaquox followed Strassi in agreeing with Fett's terms, the Klatooinian don doing so after. Toasting to their agreement, the leaders then departed to their speeders and left the palace.\nGarfalaquox's deal with Fett did not last long, as he and the other two family leaders had made a deal with the Pyke Syndicate, which required Tatooine to be hospitable for the syndicate's business. The leaders traveled to the Pykes' headquarters on Tatooine, the Desert Survey Office at the Mos Eisley spaceport, while the soldiers of the Mos Espa families and the Pykes prepared to overthrow Fett from his rule over the city. The families moved first in the resulting attack, with Garfalaquox's soldiers attacking Fett's biker gang, the Mods. The Mods struggled to hold off their attackers until they received assistance from Shand, killing a number of Aqualish family members the process. On top of that, Fett and his forces managed to drive the Pyke forces from Mos Espa, killing half of the Pykes in the battle.\nBack at the Desert Survey Office, Garfalaquox and the other family dons were present with Mok Shaiz and the Pyke Syndicate's boss on Tatooine. The Pyke boss informed the other four that his forces were withdrawing to Mos Eisley in preparation to leave the planet. Garfalaquox sat quietly as the other two dons confronted the boss, who argued that Tatooine was no longer hospitable for his syndicate. As the debate continued, though, gunshots sounded from outside. Garfalaquox was the first to draw a blaster, pulling his out while the Pyke boss called to his guards. The Pykes and the other family leaders soon followed Garfalaquox's lead, raising their blasters and checking the windows. Garfalaquox was the first to fall when a shot came in an struck him in the head, killing him. The attacker, Fennec Shand, proceeded to kill the room's six other occupants before leaving.\nGarfalaquox possessed white hair, black eyes, and pale skin. The Aqualish spoke in the Aqualish language of his species. When bowing to Lord Fett, he did so respectfully.\nThe Aqualish wore a long set of red and tan robes that featured a dark collar. The Aqualish also carried an SE-14r light repeating blaster on his person.\nGarfalaquox first appeared in \"Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land,\" the first episode of the television series The Book of Boba Fett, which aired on Disney+ on December 29, 2021. The character was portrayed by Barry Lowin and identified in the episode's credits. Prior to the release of the episode, Garfalaquox was revealed in the series' trailer on November 1, 2021.\n]]",
