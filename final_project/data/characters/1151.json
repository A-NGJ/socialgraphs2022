 "content": "1151 was a clone cadet who was a part of the Clone Youth Brigade during the Clone Wars.\nLike all clone cadets, 1151 was created by the Kaminoans for the sole purpose of military service. By 21 BBY, 1151 was training as a cadet aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, which was commanded at the time by Jedi General Mace Windu and Admiral Kilian. Unbeknownst to the cadets, their unit had been infiltrated by budding bounty hunter and mercenary Boba Fett, who sabotaged the Star Destroyer in an attempt to kill Windu. After a bomb planted in Windu's quarters failed to kill him, Fett then destroyed the reactor. Seeing that the ship was beyond saving, Kilian ordered the cadets to abandon ship. Crasher, a Clone Sergeant who was conducting the tour, ordered the eight cadets to split up into two groups of four. 1151 and three other cadets got into the escape pod occupied by Crasher, while Fett and 3 other cadets got into another pod.",
