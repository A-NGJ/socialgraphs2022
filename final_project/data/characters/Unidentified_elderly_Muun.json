 "content": "An elderly Muun was present on Scipio when Rush Clovis took over the banking clan and became the leader of the organization. The Muun expressed his gratitude to Clovis for his actions after the formal arrest of the Core Five.\nThe elderly Muun was present during the Clone Wars on the banking clan planet Scipio after Rush Clovis exposed the corruption within the clan. The Muun was seated at the Main Vault chamber formerly used by the Core Five during the latter's arrest and subsequent arrival of Clovis as the new leader of the banks. He spoke later, thanking the Senator for his services to the Muuns.\nThe elderly muun was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes who also voiced Rush Clovis and Cham Syndulla in his debut.",
