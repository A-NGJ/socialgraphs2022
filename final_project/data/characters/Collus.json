 "content": "Collus was a Human male who was one of the galaxy's most advanced philosophers.\nA native of Alderaan, Collus was responsible for establishing his homeworld's most famous university in the city of Aldera, which expanded over the years as other campuses of his institution were erected throughout the Core Worlds and beyond. Collus firmly believed that knowledge had to be applied in order to be meaningful, and that direct experience was more important than what was learned from textbooks and data disks.\nAfter his passing, Collus became a celebrated hero of the Alderaanian people. Many institutions were named after him, and University students formed the organization Students of Collus, which became a vanguard of many political movements in Aldera.",
