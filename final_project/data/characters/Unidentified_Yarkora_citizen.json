 "content": "During the Invasion of Naboo, a Yarkora  citizen lived in a house in the Slave Quarters Row in Mos Espa. During the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's visit on Tatooine, the citizen's house was overtaken by a group of criminals, who tried to rob Vek Drow. The citizen was tossed into the street, where he met Jinn, and asked his help.\nJinn then eliminated the thugs, saving Vek Drow and gaining the house for the citizen again.\nThe Yarkora citizen appears in the 1999 Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game adaptation of the Episode I film. The player, in the guise of Jinn, may meet the citizen in the game's Tatooine portion. The player has the option of helping the citizen or not, although neither option is essential is necessary to complete the mission. This article assumes the player assisted the citizen.",
