 "content": "\"Trick\" was the nickname of a Force-sensitive male Kitonak slave to the White Maw pirate gang during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Kitonak, Trick was enslaved by Shai Tenna, a leader of the White Maw pirates during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. During his time in slavery, Trick was bashed in the skull and became brain-damaged and could only connect with the Force when he feared for his life. To this end, the White Maw pirates began to torture him in order to abuse his power to cloak their ship in the Force as they moved through space.\nTrick was later freed while he was residing on Hoth during the Galactic War, traveling to Coruscant to be healed by the Jedi Order.",
