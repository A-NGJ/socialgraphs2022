 "content": "Mev was a Mantellian Savrip slave.\nMev was captured, along with fellow Savrips Clu and Taf, by a Chevin slaver known as The Mon. The Savrips were sent to The Mon's slave zoo onboard the Animiasma and jailed in the same cell. Still unbroken, the Savrips would rather find and hurt the Mon more than escape.\nAlthough unwilling to communicate to anyone outside the cells, the Savrips noticed four Tarasin children imprisoned in another cell, Li'Iri, Honna, Tiscak and Kaj. Honna speaked with the Savrips and understood their language using her own Force abilities. The Savrips, feeling sorry for the children, promised to protect them: Should anyone try to take the children against their wills, the Savrips would defy the energy bars of their cell to stop the evil-doers. Honna was glad that it did not happen, because the energy bars could have easily wound or kill the Savrips.\nPhylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves. The explosive would be activated in the case of Phylus Mon's death, but it could also be deactivated with the impact of an ion weapon. All the slaves in Phylus Mon's zoo were also regularly battered.",
