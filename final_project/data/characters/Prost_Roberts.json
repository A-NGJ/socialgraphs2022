 "content": "Prost Roberts was an untrained pilot who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Prost Roberts could be found outside the Mos Espa spaceport on Tatooine. While there, he encountered a spacer, and started complaining about the two pilots arguing next to him, Anim Kahn and Rel Keteris. Even though he wanted to leave Tatooine, he was not keen of the idea of working for Jabba Desilijic Tiure or Lady Valarian.\nHe considered the possibility of joining the Imperial Military, but admitted he did not like the way the Empire treated its piliots. He revealed that he was leaning towards joining the Rebel Alliance until he became able to support himself.\nProst Roberts is a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, he simply tells players that he would rather fly as a pilot for the Rebel Alliance, rather than the Empire, Jabba, or Lady Valarian.",
