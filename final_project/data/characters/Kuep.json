 "content": "Kuep was a Human male corporal who served as a seasoned member of the Cloud City security forces during the early years of the Galactic Civil War. Kuep was also a miner by trade and prospected Tibanna gas pockets while off duty. His part-time mining job allowed for convenient meeting times with the smugglers at Cloud City. Kuep had brown hair and fair skin.\nKuep was created for a card in the Premiere set of Decipher's Jedi Knights Trading Card Game, released in 2001.",
