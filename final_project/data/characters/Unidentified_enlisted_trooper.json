 "content": "A Human male Imperial enlisted trooper was stationed on the planet Cato Neimoidia sometime between the years 19 and 1 BBY. At one point during said time, the stormtrooper became intoxicated and attempted to devour fifty Spiced Mynock Wings. As a result, a dropship was put out of commission for several days due to the smell caused by the mess he made. Eastern Arch Platoon Leader Ton E'rau used the intoxicated stormtrooper as an example in an official reprimand to the stormtrooper's leader, TK-934. E'rau warned TK-934 that if the many illegal actions, such as the intoxicated stormtrooper's behavior, were not stopped, TK-934 would suffer a demotion.\nThe intoxicated stormtrooper was first mentioned in \"The Infinite Nebstar Casino\" entry in the in-game databank of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 versions of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, a LucasArts video game released in 2010.",
