 "content": "Raynar Cath was a male Rodian miner who lived on Lok during the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Raynar Cath worked in a mining facility operated by the Galactic Empire. During that time, Cath and Wes Riggers, another miner, meddled in the affairs of the Lok Revenants, the most powerful criminal organization on Lok and provoked the ire of their leader: the warlord Nym.\nIn 1 ABY, the miners hit a gas pocket, releasing toxic vapors in the mine. The gas did not physically injured the miners but made them crazy and very aggressive. The situation in the mine was later discovered by the Lok Revenants. Jinkins, Nym's chief engineer, thus decided to obtain a sample of the gas in order to study it and use it as a weapon if possible. Jinkins thus tasked a group of adventurous spacers of the Lok Revenants with retrieving a sample of toxic gas. While Jinkins was preparing the assault, Mako Ghast, another lieutenant of Nym, realized that the raid on the mine could be an opportunity to get rid of Riggers and Cath. The Lok Revenants then raided the Imperial mine and retrieved a sealed container of the poisonous gas for Jinkins. During the assault, the spacers attacked and killed both Wes Riggers and Raynar Cath.\nRaynar Cath was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Raynar Cath was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
