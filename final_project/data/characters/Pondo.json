 "content": "Pondo was an Ewok warrior who lived in Bright Tree Village on the forest moon of Endor. When he was still a young adult, Pondo accompanied Chief Chirpa, Warok, and other warriors to track down a monster that, according to a Dulok named Vulgarr, had kidnapped the wokling Malani. When all they found was a self-styled Dulok king named Ulgo, Pondo and the others realized that they had been tricked. They then tracked down Vulgarr and his Duloks, attacked them, and freed the woklings that the Duloks had taken captive.",
