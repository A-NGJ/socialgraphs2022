 "content": "Silm'an Voueen was a female Bothan spy who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Rakir Banai was tasked by his boss Drik Bandrik to protect his mining business from a saboteur. Banai thus hired a spacer who killed the saboteur Triggo Binz but the latter pretended before dying that Drik Bandrik was a slaver. Rakir Banai thus hired Silm'an Voueen to discover the truth. The Bothan spy investigated and was able to confirm this information. Silm'an Voueen later met the spacer who worked for Rakir Banai. After the spacer defeated several thugs who attacked her, Silm'an Voueen delivered a datadisk with data describing Drik Bandrik's slave operation.\nSilm'an Voueen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.",
