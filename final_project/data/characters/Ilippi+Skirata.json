 "content": "Ilippi Skirata, born Ilippi Jiro, was a female Human of non-Mandalorian origin, and the wife of Mandalorian Kal Skirata. Kal met her in a Corellian nightclub where she worked as a waitress. When they got married, they had a townhouse on Shuror where Kal tried to teach Ilippi how to build a basic field shelter or cook in an open fire.\nDue to not taking up the Mandalorian culture, Ilippi did not understand her husband and could not tolerate his long absences on mercenary missions. When Kal decided to start teaching their sons about the Mandalorian life, she took her children–Tor, Ijaat, and Ruusaan–and left her husband. She died at some point prior to 19 BBY.",
