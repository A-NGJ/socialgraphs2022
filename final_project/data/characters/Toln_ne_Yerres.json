 "content": "Toln ne Yerres was a Twi'lek who worked for Jabba the Hutt, managing the lucrative Holiday Towers in Cloud City on Bespin. He was always accompanied by his Gamorrean bodyguard, Glongfurrp.\nToln ne Yerres, a Twi'lek male, was born around 45 BBY. He started his criminal career as a slave in one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's ryll-running operations, working as a courier. It was during this time that he met the Gamorrean Glongfurrp, who was working as an enforcer for operation. Recognizing that the Gamorrean would devote himself to one who could provide him with work, protection, and entertainment, Yerres cultivated a relationship between the two, gaining a loyal bodyguard. Working in the Corporate Sector, Yerres soon became the right hand man to the operation's Human supervisor. However, when it became clear that the supervisor had no intention of allowing Yerres to ascend higher in Jabba's operation, Yerres framed him for embezzlement. The new supervisor was more agreeable, and allowed Yerres to move out of the slave operation.\nYerres soon established a network of contacts, including some on the planet Tatooine, where Jabba made his base of operations. After ascending a few levels in the organization, he arranged for a transfer to Tatooine to better display his talents and reap greater rewards. Yerres' credentials allowed him to become Jabba's financial manager, a heavily coveted position. However, the Twi'lek saw too many of Jabba's loyal and capable aides fall to his anger, and decided that serving Jabba away from his court would be in his best interest. When Jabba acquired the Holiday Towers around 7 BBY from Opun Mcgrrrr on Cloud City, Yerres convinced Jabba to allow him to manage it to ensure it was a profitable venture.\nOn Bespin, Yerres and his constant bodyguard, Glongfurrp, established themselves, along with a cadre of six other Gamorreans. Once, he discovered that a freighter captain was transporting goods stolen from Jabba, and sent Glongfurrp to deal with her.\nToln ne Yerres was a 1.79 meter tall Twi'lek with a paunch, a result of years of indulgence in Jabba's organization. His lekku were more of a hindrance to his balance than an aid. Yerres had a flair for management, and the inbred sense shared by Twi'lek's of waiting out a storm.\nYerres was skilled businessman, a shrewd bargainer, and an effective bureaucrat.\nYerres always carried a datapad, and a hold-out blaster for defense.",
