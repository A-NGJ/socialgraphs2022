 "content": "Bobringi Mafusa was a Mon Calamari who celebrated his Life Day aboard the luxury star-cruiser Star of Empire. He was served special Mon Calamari crab-stuffed creampuffs. Over his table was hung a banner reading \"Happy Life Day, Bobringi Mafusa. You're one fine Mon Calamari\". After Bobringi and his friends exited the Star of the Empire during an evacuation, Zak Arranda located their abandoned party table and attempted to eat one of the creampuffsâ€”much to his later regret, as the creampuffs were filled with live crabs.",
