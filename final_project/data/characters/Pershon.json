 "content": "Pershon was the servant of the Hejaran family of House Mecetti. He served several generations of the family including Baron Lucian Hejaran. Pershon knew the families inner most secrets but was alway loyal to his master Lucian. Following the death of the Baron, Pershon was murdered by the Baron's kinsmen Brigta Hejaran who used dark side powers to strangle him without leaving any mark. Brigta killed Pershon to prevent him from revealing the Barons journals and the secrets about Brigta's fall to the dark side. It was Brigta who had killed Lucian when she discovered that he was aware of her corruption by the dark side.",
