 "content": "Inkari was a female Human officer in the Imperial Military of the reconstituted Sith Empire who joined the radicalized Order of Revan during the Galactic War. Holding the title of Lord Commander, Inkari was among the Revanite commanders who led the Revanite forces in defense of the Temple of Sacrifice during the battle on Yavin 4. Inkari was slain in the ruins near the Temple's gates by forces from the Imperial-Republic coalition.\nLord Commander Inkari appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan, a 2014 Digital Expansion for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and is one of four named enemies that must be defeated by players in the mission \"The Enemy Within.\" Her helmet includes a graphics error that hides or prevents her face from rendering, but if one is close enough to Inkari, her face is visible and depicts her as a fair-skinned Human with solid red eyes, the kind used for the Chiss species.",
