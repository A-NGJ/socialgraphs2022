 "content": "Vran was a Human male Sith Saber of the Lost Tribe of Sith, and a crewmember of the Starstalker alongside his sister, Kaara. They took place in the endeavor to acquire wintrium from the Fountain of Ancients on Klatooine, and they were met by resistance from Klatooinian guards. Kaara was killed in the skirmish, and the Sith were attacked by Hutts who were sworn to protect the Fountain. Later, the Starstalker's Captain, Vyn Holpur, and the rest of the crew, including Vran, were sentenced to death for violating the Fountain.",
