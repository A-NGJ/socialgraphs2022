 "content": "Wynt Kepporra was a Human male from Alderaan, a classmate of Delak Krennel at the Prefsbelt IV Naval Academy. Kepporra participated in the Thespian Union, and later became a captain in the Imperial Navy. An engineer, he was home visiting his family and died when the Empire destroyed Alderaan with the first Death Star.\nYears later, Ysanne Isard's clone would suggest that Krennel claim that Keppora was his best friend, and to be devastated by his death, as a means of offsetting the negative publicity of the Pulsar Station.",
