 "content": "Korso was a human male criminal who provided muscle for Tobias Beckett's gang. On the planet Mimban, he disguised himself in stolen Imperial swamp trooper armor, an Imperial fleet trooper helmet, and an Imperial officer greatcoat. He helped Beckett to infiltrate the Imperial Army in exchange for passage off Mimban. He was killed by a Mimbanese during the Mimban Campaign.\nKorso was played by New Zealand actor John Tui in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story. According to screenwriter Jon Kasdan, Tui's performance was great, but given the hectic environment of the scene, it became confusing to introduce Korso as he was going to immediately get killed off. The sequence of Korso's death is featured in the film's Deleted Scenes. The character's original logic, as a larger man, was that Beckett's gang had lost their muscle and Beckett saw Chewbacca as a useful replacement. An early version of the Solo script had Korso as Lando Calrissian's older brother.",
