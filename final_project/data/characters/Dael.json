 "content": "Dael was a Human male commander and major of Base D-55, a Galactic Republic base on the planet of Dantooine. After the Treaty of Coruscant was completed, Dael was one of the commanders that refused to comply any conditions set forth from the Treaty and knew that the contract would not last long. During the battle of Dantooine, Dael was visited by Grand Master Satele Shan and Lieutenant Harron Tavus to convince Dael to call in a retreat. Refusing to withdraw, Dael openly engaged against the Imperial forces along with other military commanders.",
