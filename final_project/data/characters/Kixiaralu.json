 "content": "Kixiaralu, nicknamed Kixi for short, was a female Mirialan who lived on the Republic capital of Coruscant in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War.\nBorn on Ryloth, she became a skilled slicer on computer networks during the time of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. After the Treaty of Coruscant, she taught a disgraced Republic trooper named Larin Moxla about the abilities upon Moxla's arrival to Coruscant. When she combined Kixi's training with the basics of slicing she learned in the Republic Special Forces' Blackstar Squad, Moxla became a formidable slicer in her own right, and used those talents while trying to clean up the gang-dominated streets of Coruscant.\nIn 3645 BBY, Kixi was later captured by the Migrant Merchants' Guild, a criminal organization on Coruscant, and forced to slice into computer systems for two years before being discovered by a smuggler. She assisted her rescuer by accessing and sabotaging the personal files of a criminal, the smuggler was pursuing.\nKixi was first mentioned in the 2010 novel The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance, written by Sean Williams. Player Characters of the Smuggler class in BioWare's massively multiplayer online roleplaying game  Star Wars: The Old Republic meet Kixi during their storyline on Coruscant. The player has the option to either free her from imprisonment, take her into custody, or kill her, depending on dialog choices.",
