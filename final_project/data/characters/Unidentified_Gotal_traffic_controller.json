 "content": "A Gotal male worked as a traffic controller for the planet Atzerri's Air Traffic Control during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Around 22 BBY, he and his associate, the Human Elmyo, hailed the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett's ship after Fett entered Atzerri's atmosphere. Elmyo suggested that Fett begin negotiations for the landing fee, and the Gotal traffic controller apologized for the man's denigration of the famous bounty hunter. The Gotal asked Fett to prove his identity, but the bounty hunter instead launched two rockets at their traffic control ship, killing both the Gotal and Elmyo.\nA Gotal male lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Around the year 22 BBY, he served the planet Atzerri's Air Traffic Control as an officer, and was training a new recruit, the Human Elmyo.\nDuring the same year, the Gotal and Elmyo were out on patrol and intercepted the starship Slave I, which belonged to the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, after it entered the atmosphere of Atzerri. The Gotal hailed Fett over the traffic control ship's comlink, asking if he had been to Atzerri before. When Fett confirmed that he had, Elmyo suggested that landing fee negotiations begin, but he was interrupted when Fett revealed his identity. As Elmyo, who was unaware of Fett's reputation as a bounty hunter, kept talking to the Mandalorian, the Gotal grabbed the comlink from the Human and apologized to Fett for Elmyo's derisive behavior. The Gotal asked Fett to provide proof of his identity, but the Mandalorian responded by launching two rockets at the Gotal's ship. The missiles destroyed the starship, killing the Gotal and Elmyo.\nThe Gotal had brown hair and yellow eyes. He was fearful when Jango Fett revealed that he was Slave I's pilot. He berated Elmyo for his attitude toward Fett and was nervous as he asked the Mandalorian to confirm his identity.\nThe Gotal wore a white jacket.\nThe Gotal traffic controller appeared in a flashback sequence in the first issue of the comic miniseries Star Wars: Blood Ties. The comic was written by Tom Taylor, illustrated by Chris Scalf, and published on August 25, 2010.",
