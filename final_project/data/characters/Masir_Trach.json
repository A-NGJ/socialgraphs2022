 "content": "Masir Trach was a human male who served as a commander and scanner officer in the First Order, and held a rank befitting that of a senior officer. Previously assigned to the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, when Trach was transferred to the Steadfast he was caught in the rivalry between General Armitage Hux and Allegiant General Enric Pryde, the commanders of the Finalizer and Steadfast respectively after the Finalizer was crippled during the Battle of Batuu and Supreme Leader Kylo Ren had Hux transferred with him to the Steadfast when the Master of the Knights of Ren took the ship as his new Destroyer to prevent his old rival from starting a mutiny. Although Trach could sense the tension between the two officers and was aware that the orders they gave him carried ulterior political moments, to avoid dispute he chose to focus on carrying out the letter of his orders.\nTrach participated in the Battle of Exegol, the final confrontation in the war against the Resistance as part of the Final Order. During the battle, Trach witnessed a group of Resistance fighters, led by former First Order stormtrooper Finn, launch a ground assault on Exegol riding orbak mounts. He declared his shock that they used animals rather than speeders, preventing their opponents from using technology to disable the vehicles. The Steadfast was ultimately destroyed and the Resistance won the battle.\nMasir Trach first appeared in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the final installment of the Skywalker saga, where he was portrayed by the actor Amir El-Masry. The character's surname was revealed in the film's credits, where he is listed as \"Commander Trach,\" while his forename was revealed in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
