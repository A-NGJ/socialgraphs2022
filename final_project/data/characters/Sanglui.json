 "content": "Sanglui was a male Squalris who secretly led a Rebel cell on the planet Vorzyd V during the era of the Galactic Civil War. The proprietor of a successful import-export business, Sanglui cultivated the image of a high-society fop, which served as cover for his clandestine activities. He was rarely seen without his beloved pet husk lizard, Farnak.\nA Squalris from the planet Ifmix VI, Sanglui eventually migrated to the \"Gambler's World\" of Vorzyd V, where he set up an import-export business that had become extremely lucrative by 1 ABY. Sanglui's success and wealth allowed him access to the Outer Rim world's most exclusive social circles, as well as a gleaming office in the center of the capital city of Efavan. But while Sanglui had courted a reputation as an insubstantial dandy concerned mostly with flashy clothes and fine foods, that was by design: Sanglui had a secret life as the leader of Efavan's Rebel cell, working behind the scenes to return the planet's wealth to its people.\nIn 1 ABY, Vorzyd V was visited by a pair of prominent Rebel leaders, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who intended to meet with an unidentified Rebel sympathizer who was placed highly in the planet's government. Sanglui was aware of the contact's identity—Vorzyd V President Natala Vanden—but kept her name a tightly held secret, fearing that if the knowledge of who she was got out it would lead to a vicious reprisal from the Galactic Empire. The Squalris received a signal from Vanden requesting a meeting soon after Skywalker and Organa arrived on the planet, but insisted that she would meet with just one of them. To determine who would go, Sanglui called a meeting with Skywalker, Organa and a local Rebel agent named Paxin, and the four drew straws to meet Vanden: Skywalker, ever lucky, drew the short straw.\nSanglui was a staple among the high-class social circles of Vorzyd V, whose denizens considered him a glutton and dandy with a friendly and docile personality. It was a reputation that Sanglui was glad to reinforce, as he was never seen without colorful expensive clothes, jeweled rings, and his beloved pet husk lizard Farnak. However, Sanglui used that persona to hide his true ambition: as the leader of the Rebels in Efavan, Sanglui dreamed of seizing the Empire's wealth on Vorzyd V and redistributing it to the planet's people. Extremely committed to the Rebel cause, Sanglui was willing to absorb any risk to protect Alliance interests on Vorzyd V. In situations where Sanglui had to defend himself, he was known to wield a SoroSuub ELG-3A blaster pistol.\nSanglui made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Gambler's World, a comic strip story arc written and illustrated by Russ Manning and released in 1979.",
