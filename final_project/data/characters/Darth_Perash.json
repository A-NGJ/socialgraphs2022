 "content": "Darth Perash was a Sith Lord of Human or Sith pureblood descent who served the Sith Empire. The Sith spent decades building an elaborate tomb, often ordering the workers to tear down everything they had done and start over. Around the year 3643 BBY, scavengers searched through the latest rubble from the tomb's construction and salvaged construction materials and items Perash had overlooked.\nDarth Perash was first mentioned as part of the scavenging crew skills mission \"Perfectionist\" in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic. The mission did not make clear Perash's gender or species but the German mission description indicates that Darth Perash is female.",
