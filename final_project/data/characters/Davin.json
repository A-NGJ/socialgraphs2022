 "content": "Davin was a male Lasat who worked with Ephraim and Mira Bridger during the early stages of the rebellion.\nDavin was a male Lasat operative. At one point, he was hit by a blaster shot and the medics fitted him with a cyborg lung.\nAround 18 BBY, he was working with Ephraim Bridger and Mira Bridger against the Galactic Empire.\nHe agreed to be captured by the bounty hunter the Shade in order to help free the children Milo Graf and Lina Graf aboard the starship Moveable Feast.\nWith the help of Milo, they were able to escape when a cargo of Cylo's cyborg spiders broke loose. They then rendezvoused with the Bridgers' vessel Sunburst.\nHis mother often called him brave. He was scared of spiders, but agreed to let the spiders swarm them in order to escape their cell. He then sheepishly admitted that he had a cyborg lung. After being hit with a stun stick again, he declared that he would never work with the Bridgers again. He also believed a Hydrospanner could be a good tool to hit people with.\nDavin appears in the young readers novel Adventures in Wild Space: The Dark.",
