 "content": "Tobix Chasser was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as a junior lieutenant. He was tasked with overseeing the Death Star's allocation of staff. Chasser took part in the Battle of Scarif; at its inception, disguised members of the Rogue One team were able to sneak past Chasser and his troops in order to steal the Death Star plans. Shortly thereafter, the station itself arrived in-system and, on the orders of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, fired on Scarif, obliterating the Imperial installation there in an attempt to prevent the theft.\nChasser appeared, played by an unknown actor, in the 2016 anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, where he remained unnamed. He was identified and his role in the Imperial military expanded on in the film's visual dictionary.",
