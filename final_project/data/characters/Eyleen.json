 "content": "Eyleen was a Human female who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, she was part of a group of thugs who lived in the slums of Mos Espa. This group also included Hilbrun, Tiomvo and Guz'Ordnak. In 1 ABY, they bought the booster controller of the R2 unit motivator to the junk dealer Watto. One of them left his swoop bike as collateral but they never paid Watto for the booster controller. Since this R2 unit was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra, a spacer later tried to recover the motivator booster controller. Eyleen and the thieves attacked the spacer on sight but the spacer managed to retrieve the booster controller from Hilbrun's USV-5 Modified Landspeeder.\nEyleen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Eyleen was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nEyleen is an enemy NPC who might attack the player when the player tries to retrieve the engine parts from a landspeeder situated right next to her. When she attacks, the player will have to kill her in order to get the parts, as one cannot interact with objects while in combat mode. However, since it is possible to sneak around her and retrieve the parts unnoticed, her death or survival is not canonically established.\nAccording to the game's directory .tree files and reference manuals, this character was originally named Daezii Mae.",
