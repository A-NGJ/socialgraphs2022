 "content": "Memnon Demaratus was a Human male mercenary who worked on Coruscant during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn approximately 3643 BBY, he was hired by Senator Starsnow to retrieve the journal of his son, a Jedi Master who had died during the Sacking of Coruscant, from the wreckage of the Jedi Temple. His team failed in this effort due to the presence of Imperial forces. Imperial soldiers and Sith filled the ruins and attacked Demaratus' team. Demaratus escaped with two members of his team and met with a traveling Republic hero and the heroes companion outside of the Temple's entrance. He turned the contract over to them and they were able to recover the journal.\nMemnon Demaratus appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the Coruscant mission \"Insult to Injury\"",
