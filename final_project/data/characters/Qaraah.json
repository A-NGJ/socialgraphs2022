 "content": "Qaraah was a male Rishii living on Rishi during the Galactic War. A self-proclaimed \"cantina-talk type\", he was comfortable hanging around the outsiders and thuse settled in the town of Raider's Cove and not one his native people's villages. In 3637 BBY he heard rumors about Gorro challenging to a fight a prominent pirate gang leader and when that individual arrived on Rishi and approached Qaraah, he was very enthusiastic about the encounter and was happy to show the way to Gorro. Unknown to him, the individual was not a real pirate leader, which was a false identity fabricated by Theron Shan and Lana Beniko. After the individual departed Rishi, Qaraah sent a follow-up letter, describing how the meeting had affected his life.",
