 "content": "This male Rodian served as a bounty hunter for the corpulent Rodian crime lord Reelo Baruk during the year 12 ABY. The Rodian worked at Baruk's cantina located on the moon Nar Shaddaa, and would work with another Rodian to act as doormen to the cantina, where their duties included confiscating weapons from conspicuous guests. The Rodian was eventually slain during a lightfight with New Republic mercenary and Jedi Kyle Katarn, who was looking for Baruk.\nThe Rodian was active as a bounty hunter during the year 12 ABY, during the reign of the New Republic. At some point, the Rodian was hired by the corpulent Rodian crime lord Reelo Baruk. The Rodian was eventually employed to Baruk's Bar located on the moon Nar Shaddaa, and together with another Rodian he acted as a doorman. The pair of Rodians would hang out in the bar and welcome arriving guests, while confiscating their weapons. When Baruk began supplying weapons and mercenaries to the Imperial Remnant forces of Galak Fyyar and the Dark Jedi Desann, the crime boss had attracted the attention of the New Republic government, who were engaged in a conflict with Fyyar's forces.\nMercenary and Jedi Kyle Katarn was eventually dispatched to Nar Shaddaa to find and eliminate Baruk. Katarn first went to Baruk's Bar to look for leads, and upon entering he was greeted by the Rodian bounty hunter and his partner. The Rodian confiscated Katarn's Bryar pistol and other weapons before allowing Katarn entry into the cantina. The Rodian, however, failed to acquire Katarn's lightsaber. When Katarn was double-crossed by the Chiss bartender, Baldarek, the bounty hunters turned on Katarn with their own weapons. The Rodian, having taken the weapons to a room above the bar area, rushed into the fray with an E-11 blaster rifle. The Rodian, and all of the other bounty hunters and cantina patrons, were killed by Katarn. The bartender was spared, however, after Katarn extracted further information from him. Eventually, with the help of a man named Lando Calrissian, Katarn ended Baruk's part in the war.\nThe Rodian was abrupt and too the point when it came to confiscating Katarn's weapons. When violence broke out in the bar, the Rodian was quick to join the fray, eager to fight. The Rodian had green skin and bluish-green eyes.\nThe Rodian used an E-11 blaster rifle when he fought Kyle Katarn, and wore a white jumpsuit. He was proficient with the rifle, but was unable to kill Katarn with it.\nThe Rodian first appeared in the 2002 video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. During the first level that took place on Nar Shaddaa, he was the first non-player character to have spoken dialogue. While enemies can be routinely disarmed throughout the game and be left unharmed, this Rodian, as well as all bounty hunters during his portion of the level, had to be killed in order to trigger the next cutscene. All Rodians were voiced by either Michael Gough or Tom Kane, credited as Rodian 2 and Rodian 1 respectively. It is not clear what Rodian this one was, although he was the first one to speak.",
