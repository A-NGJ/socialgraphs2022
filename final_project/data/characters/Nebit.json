 "content": "Nebit was a Jawa male who served as chief of a tribe of Jawas from the planet Tatooine. The Jawa's combed the planet's deserts in a sandcrawler for lost droids or technology that they could sell. In 0 BBY, Nebit and his tribe stopped at the Lars moisture farm and brought out a variety of droids for the Lars family to browse. Owen Lars selected the protocol droid C-3PO and the astromech droid R5-D4 from amongst Nebit's stock, but as the pair discussed the purchase, R5-D4 blew its motivator.\nBased on advice from C-3PO, Lars' nephew Luke Skywalker then recommended they buy the astromech R2-D2 instead, which Nebit agreed to. The sandcrawler was later attacked by Imperial stormtroopers searching for C-3PO and R2-D2. Most of Nebit's tribe were murdered in the attack, and as he died, Nebit pointed the Imperials in the direction of the Lars Homestead. The bodies of the tribe were later found and burnt by Skywalker, the droids, and the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nNebit first appeared in the 1977 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In the current canon, the Jawa was first named in the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection which initially launched in 2013. Although the launch of Force Collection predates the Star Wars canon reset of 2014, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon.",
