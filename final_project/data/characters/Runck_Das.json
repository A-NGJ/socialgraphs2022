 "content": "Runck Das of Domain Das was a member of the Warrior caste of the Yuuzhan Vong. During the Battle of Garqi, Das was dispatched by Krag Val to inform Commander Shedao Shai that three Jedi had engaged the Yuuzhan Vong, and they seemed to be protecting something . Das managed to send a message to Shai, who then arrived and found that Warriors had been burned where they laid. Das said that there was nothing he could have done, but Shai responded that he could have been faster. Commander Shai then pressed his foot down on Das's neck, popping the skull off and killing him.",
