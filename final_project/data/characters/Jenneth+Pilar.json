 "content": "Jenneth Pilar was a human male Imperial officer who served the Galactic Empire during the first year of its reign. As an officer, he planned and oversaw the occupation of Raada and oppression of its farm workers so the Empire can yield more food production. After an attack on the moon's Imperial base by local rebels, including a Force-sensitive, resulting in the arrival of the Sixth Brother, an Imperial Inquisitor, Pilar fled Imperial service in an attempt to avoid potential punishment.\nJenneth Pilar first appeared in the 2016 novel Ahsoka, written by E. K. Johnston. Pilar's last name was inspired by Kevin Pillar, a Major League Baseball center fielder formerly of the Toronto Blue Jays. At the time Johnston, who is Canadian herself, was naming the characters in Ahsoka, Pillar was playing well in spring training.",
