 "content": "Alchibi Mors was a Chevin who spoke briefly on being an outcast from a variety of societies, and the circumstances of how one might find themselves in such situations. They strove to improve society on their homeworld, and felt things could be better for the down and out in the galaxy as a whole. Facing resistance on their homeworld, they departed to make a better home elsewhere.\nAlchibi Mors appeared in the role-playing sourcebook Far Horizons released in 2014 and developed by Sam Stewart.",
