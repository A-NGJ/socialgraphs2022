 "content": "Tepoh was a Naboo human aide who worked for Naboo Representative Saché shortly after the beginning of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. A non-binary individual who used the pronouns zhe/zher, Tepoh was part of the diplomatic corps whose skillset came to the attention of Senator Padmé Amidala's office and led to an interview for a potential position as one of Amidala's handmaidens. A primary qualification for the original handmaidens was their physical resemblance to Amidala; Tepoh never thought becoming one was a possibility since zhe was not a girl. When the handmaiden Dormé interviewed Tepoh, she ruled zher out for Amidala's team due to having such similar skillsets, but she recommended zher to Saché.\nTepoh appeared in the 2022 novel Queen's Hope by E. K. Johnston.",
