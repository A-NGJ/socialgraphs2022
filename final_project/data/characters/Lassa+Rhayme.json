 "content": "Lassa Rhayme was a Pantoran female pirate who served as the captain of the Opportunity and leader of the Blood Bone Order during the Clone Wars. During the last months of the war, she had an encounter with bounty hunter Asajj Ventress, whom she considered a friend after successfully recovering the Steady On and its cargo from Hondo Ohnaka and his gang on their own.\nA Pantoran female and pirate, Lassa Rhayme was unlike her people in that she had no tattoos to signify her family affiliation. She only had loyalties only to her crew, the Blood Bone Order, where she was voted into the position of leadership, as the captain of the Opportunity. As such, she gained a reputation of being a terrifying tyrant on purpose; in reality, though, she treated everyone on her crew justly, and killed others only when necessary.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rhayme and her crew planned to steal the cargo of the Steady On, a ship tasked with transporting an valuable statuette to black market dealer, Sheb Valaad, on Otor's Hub. However, upon her ship's arrival at the proper coordinates, the only ships they encountered were fighters floating dead in space, with only one survivor—a wounded Asajj Ventress. Rhayme brought her to the Opportunity's sickbay, where her injuries could heal, and had Ventress's ship, the Banshee, towed in for repairs. Discovering her yellow lightsaber, Rhayme recruited Ventress' help to recover the Steady On. As sent by Rhayme, one of her crew members reported that Hondo Ohnaka and his gang were responsible for the theft, but that he wasn't on his base on Florrum.\nVia hologram, she contacted Jiro, who had been put in charge in Hondo's absence, and made him a proposition to join the gang in exchange for a \"Jedi\". The Weequay agreed, intrigued by her, and permitted them to land in front of Hondo's complex. During their talk, Rhayme convinced him that she was trustworthy by handing over Ventress, even though she kept her lightsaber, and made Jiro send most of his men on a wild caranak chase. As Ventress stealthily acquired a transport to leave the planet, Jiro realized Rhayme's trick and confronted her, but she used the lightsaber to keep him at bay, only for Ohnaka to arrive and confront her. Ohnaka, using his electrostaff, fought her, but in the end, she bested him and aimed a blaster directly to his chest; defeated, the Weequay pirate surrendered, thinking she would kill him. Back on the Opportunity, she and Ventress celebrated their success, having come to think of the bounty hunter as a friend. Afterwards, they parted ways, as Ventress delivered the item to Valaad, as promised.\nDuring the war's last months, Rhayme was in a romantic relationship with her first mate; however, he betrayed her by running away with Rhayme's last intended target—that is, the haul and the heiress they intended to take it from. Taking it very personally, Rhayme put quite a lucrative bounty on his head. It would be Ventress and her by-then current partner, Quinlan Vos, who took on the bounty and got the mark in fifteen minutes flat. Grateful, Rhayme rewarded them with credits and a bottle of aged Tevraki whiskey.\nDuring the reign of the Galactic Empire, Rhayme became a food and weapons supplier for a subgroup of the mainly extinct Partisans known as the Dreamers. Rhayme was used by the Imperial group Inferno Squad to smuggle members Gideon Hask and Del Meeko into the ranks of the Dreamers under the lie of being brothers who hated the Empire. They successfully infiltrated and killed the Dreamers along with their other team members Seyn Marana and Iden Versio who got in by other means.\nDespite her reputation as a terrifying pirate, Rhayme was a confident, independent and egalitarian woman, who had inspired the fervent respect of her crew, to whom she was very loyal. With a strict, strong code of honor, she divided everything into equal shares, forbade cheating among the crew and fighting on the ship, as well as allowing desertion from her ranks as long as they left on good terms. She also disliked senseless killing, preferring to kill only when needed.\nAs much as she like to spread tales of her \"tyranny\" with gusto, she liked Tevraki whiskey, believing \"a finer thing would never to touch  lips.\"\nRhayme was a competent swordswoman, being able to wield a lightsaber quite well, enjoying its handling and the sound they made. With Ventress' lightsaber, she managed to defend herself from Hondo Ohnaka's electrostaff and disarm, despite lacking a strong connection to the Force",
