 "content": "Rholl was a male Wookiee pirate who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. According to Kaliyo Djannis, an ex-associate of Rholl, Rholl was a pirate with a bad temper who hijacked Galactic Republic supply ships. They were apparently close and he considered her somewhat like a daughter but they had a falling out when Kaliyo wanted a bigger cut and tried to steal from him. Kaliyo tried to kill him but only managed to break his arm. Years later, Kaliyo made him a target of Imperial Intelligence and had Cipher Nine kill him.",
