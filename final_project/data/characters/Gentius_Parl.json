 "content": "Gentius Parl was a male Human brawler who served as the leader of a criminal gang that operated in the Qaestar Steps on the planet Talus.\nParl had long, black-colored hair, over which he wore a polycloth bandanna in the style of a pirate. A keen businessman, he was not opposed to entering into legitimate deals on occasion. He was also a student of the Double Worlds' astrology and he rarely made any decisions without first trying to determine whether the heavens favored him or not.",
