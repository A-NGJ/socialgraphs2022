 "content": "Mercy was a female human slave owned by the Sullustan crime lord Surat Nuat. She always treated the crime lord well, and he mostly returned her kindness. Several months after the Battle of Endor, Nuat was reminded of his slave girl when his prisoner Temmin Wexley asked for mercy, causing the Sullustan to comment that the Corellian was the only mercy he had ever had.\nMercy was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
