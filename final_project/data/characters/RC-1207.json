 "content": "RC-1207, nicknamed \"Sev,\" was an elite clone commando who was part of Delta Squad during the Clone Wars. At some point, he and his fellow commandos were sent into an engagement from a Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry. In the battle, his squad's mission was to secure territory from enemy hands.\nSev and the other members of Delta Squad were sent to Devaron. In the aftermath of the battle waged on the planet, they recovered the bodies of Jedi Master Halsey and his Padawan, Knox, and returned them to Coruscant. The squad was met on the landing platform by Jedi High Council members Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, Saesee Tiin, and Adi Gallia, who noted that the massacre was of similar caliber of the damage done by Asajj Ventress who was presumed dead. Security footage of the battle was recovered and included a hologram of Halsey's death at the hands of an as-yet unknown assassin.\nSev and Delta Squad first appeared in the 2005 Star Wars Legends video game, Star Wars: Republic Commando. During development of \"Witches of the Mist,\" a season three episode of Star Wars: the Clone Wars, supervising director Dave Filoni requested that the team incorporate Delta Squad into the plot. The episode guide for \"Witches of the Mist\" brought Sev's nickname into the new canon. His clone number, RC-1207, was brought into canon via Jason Fry's 2021 reference book Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!.",
