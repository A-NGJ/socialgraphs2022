 "content": "Chaf'ees'aklaio, known by her core name of Feesa, was a member of the Chaf family, and the second niece and aide of Aristocra Formbi. Along with the Aristocra, she was onboard the Chiss vessel Chaf Envoy that took Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker to Outbound Flight, an Galactic Republic vessel that had crashed in the Redoubt, a nebula which was the last defense of the Chiss people.\nShe served bravely during the expedition â€“ she was wounded by the Vagaari when they revealed themselves. She was also responsible for carrying out some of Formbi's plans for duping the Vagaari so the Chiss could attack them.",
