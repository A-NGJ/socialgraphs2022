 "content": "Stephon Sprocketfire was a Human male who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Stephon Sprocketfire was present on the planet Dathomir when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Sprocketfire, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation. Stephon Sprocketfire took shelter in Camp Beta, along with the miner Volo Madine and the Bothan Oona Wran. Sprocketfire was in charge of the forward defense of the camp and used to recruit spacers who ventured into the Quarantine Zone to help him in that mission.\nStephon Sprocketfire was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Stephon Sprocketfire was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
