 "content": "Hrrgn was a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk who escaped from the spice mines of the planet Kessel and evaded the Galactic Empire alongside Roshyk, Kirratha and three other Wookiees at a time no one else could. Following their escape, Hrrgn and the others became mercenaries who cared little for the politics of the New Republic. The smuggler Han Solo considered Hrrgn and the other Wookiee escapees to be some of the meanest, hairiest brutes he knew, and asked his co-pilot Chewbacca to contact them when an opportunity came up to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire's grasp after the Battle of Endor.\nHrrgn was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
