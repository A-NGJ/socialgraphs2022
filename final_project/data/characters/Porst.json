 "content": "Porst was an old human male who was the owner of the depot in Tikaroo, a city on the planet Devaron. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Luke landed with his BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber near the town. He went to the depot to take a rest and find a guide who could lead him to the Temple of Eedit. Porst regarded it as an evil place with a demon and that it was better to stay at the depot. Luke eventually found Sarco Plank and was guided to the Temple by him.",
