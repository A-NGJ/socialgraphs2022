 "content": "Rinn Renado was the Human male leader of a corporate resistance movement on Metellos. He specialized in guerrilla tactics and concentrated his efforts against CarsinShare and Nonsu targets. He saw Metellos as irredeemable and thus had no long-term goals, content with stirring up anarchy.\nHe sometimes recruited from the gladiators who fought in Ektra. Losers in the gladiatorial contests were dropped 1,200 meters from a repulsorlift spire, and Renado would occasionally position an aircar underneath to catch them. They were offered an opportunity to join the anarchists or continue their deadly fall.\nRenado could speak the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook.",
