 "content": "Silvarte was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Silvarte was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Master Silvarte returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. Selecting the young Moracen as his Padawan, Master Silvarte and fellow Master Yollo became suspicious of their students, believing that both Padawans Moracen and Spanios had begun a romantic relationship. To get an idea of the situation's severity, Master Silvarte sent another Padawan to discover whether the two apprentices were indeed romantically involved.\nWhile serving as an instructor at the academy, Master Silvarte would mildly rebuke his students who fought with a clumsy stance during practice, masters of the \"Form of the Guid\", comparing their lightsaber stance similar to the wild guid that roamed Tython. He later authorized Devon Race to go on an expedition to the ruins of the Jedi Tower on Taris to recover artifacts.\nSilvarte was critical of students who he felt were lax in their training as well as students who didn't completely follow the standard rules of the Jedi. He also appeared to quickly dismiss the latter, since he immediately declared Moracen and Spanios 'wastes' upon learning they started a relationship.",
