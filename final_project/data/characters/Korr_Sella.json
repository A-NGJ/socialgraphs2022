 "content": "Korr Sella, also known by the nickname Korrie, was a female human military officer who served as a commander in the naval forces of the Resistance during its conflict with the First Order. She served under the command of General Leia Organa as her envoy to the New Republic, delivering warnings from the general about the actions of the First Order—warnings that generally fell on deaf ears in the Galactic Senate. Sella was on Hosnian Prime, the capital of the Republic, to deliver a warning when the First Order destroyed the planet using their Starkiller Base superweapon, killing Sella and the rest of Hosnian Prime's population.\nSella was born in 12 ABY to Sondiv Sella and a fellow New Republic politician. In 28 ABY, when Sella was sixteen years old, she followed in the footsteps of her parents by entering public service, working for Senator Leia Organa at the Galactic Senate on the galactic capital Hosnian Prime. One of her jobs in the service of Organa was to prepare review holos for her so the senator could recognize each delegate in attendance at official events. Her employer Organa was a member of the Populists, a faction in the Senate that favored the decentralized New Republic. The Populists clashed with the Centrists, who advocated a stronger central government and military.\nFollowing a ceremony to dedicate a statue to the memory of the late Senator Bail Organa, Sella suggested that Leia accept an invitation from the Centrist Senator Bevicard to attend a reception on Coruscant in order to build friendship between the Centrists and Populists. In response, Organa explained that the invitation was only a symbolic gesture and that Bevicard would be mortified if she had actually accepted it. When Sella asked whether the two factions were really apart, Leia clarified that this was indeed the case. Sella and another staffer Greer Sonnel were present when a frustrated Leia expressed her desire to quit the Senate.\nLater, Sella accompanied Leia Organa, Greer Sonnel, and the pilot Joph Seastriker, and the Centrist Senator Ransolm Casterfo on a senatorial mission to investigate the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel, which was based on Bastatha. The group traveled aboard Leia's personal starship, Mirrorbright. During the journey, Casterfo tried to make conversation with Sella but she came up with the excuse of having to review her work. While visiting a casino in Bastatha, Sella took the opportunity to practice the diplomatic courtesies that Sonnel had taught her. When Leia played a game of cards with the local Niktos, Sella offered to record a tally of her wins and losses. However, Organa told her to enjoy her drink.\nAfter Casterfo rescued Leia from Rinnrivin's underground headquarters, Sella ran a preliminary data analysis of the crime lord's droids and discovered that the crime lord was channeling his gambling and smuggling profits into shadow corporations on various Outer Rim worlds. After Leia returned to Hosnian Prime, Sella joined C-3PO and Sonnel in encouraging Organa to nominate herself for First Senator, a post that had been proposed by the Centrists to end the deadlock in the New Republic. While the Populists had initially opposed the idea, they decided to nominate one of their own in order to prevent a Centrist from occupying that office.\nA few days later, Sella offered to bring a cushion for Senator Organa to relax after a busy day hosting several visitors including the leader of the Association of Small Craft Manufacturers, ore traders from Gad, and several junior senators from Populist worlds in the Outer Rim. Leia declined because she did not want to fall asleep in her office. Shortly later, the Centrist Senator Lady Carise Sindian visited to obtain a document that allowed her to inherit the Supreme governorship of Birren. Since Leia was not interested in that position, she had transferred it to Lady Carise. While on Birren, Lady Carise discovered information on Leia's parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader. Unknown to everyone else, Lady Carise was a secret agent of the First Order, an Imperial remnant, and was working behind the scenes to destabilize the New Republic.\nLater, Sella survived a bomb attack that destroyed half the Senatorial conference building. Sella was not wounded by the bomb but was frightened. She found her friend Greer Sonnel, who had also escaped the bombing, and the two managed to find Leia after being tended to by a medical droid. Following the so-called \"Napkin Bombing,\" Sella accompanied Leia, Seastriker, and C-3PO on a mission to Ryloth to search the planet's archives for information about Rinnrivin's cartel. After three hours, Sella complained that everything in the archives was written on paper. She also uncovered information about Rinnrivin's origins as a lowly spice dealer before becoming a major crime lord in the past seven years. Based on the records, Sella theorized that Rinnrivin was channeling funds to Centrist worlds and suggested that the Centrists were also funding him.\nFollowing the visit to the archives, Sella, Seastriker, and C-3PO took the Mirrorbright for a flight above Ryloth while Leia attended a reception hosted by her old comrade Emissary Yendor. In Leia's absence, Sella and her companions received information from Casterfo that Rinnrivin had secret relay satellites above Ryloth. After C-3PO sliced into one of the satellites, they discovered that Rinnrivin was hiding in the Expansion Region world of Sibensko, which was also the headquarters of a paramilitary faction called the Amaxine warriors. Seastriker and Casterfo had determined that the Amaxines were colluding with Rinnrivin's cartel. While Leia was initially annoyed with her underlings for not consulting her, she was mollified to learn about Rinnrivin's whereabouts. Sella later accompanied Leia and her team to the planet Harloff Minor for a secret meeting with Rinnrivin.\nWhile approaching Hosnian Prime, Sella went through Leia's communiques which included messages from Leia's colleagues Senator Tai-Lin Garr and Varish Vichly. They also read news reports of the Centrists and Populists blaming each other for the Napkin Bombing. They also received word from Casterfo about his investigation on Daxam IV, which had taken a \"dramatic leap forward.\" After digesting the news reports, Sella and Seastriker asked Senator Organa whether the New Republic was going to collapse. Leia responded that the infighting between the two factions could lead to a schism unless things did not work out.\nLater, Sella was deeply upset and angry following the public revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader, the dreaded Imperial enforcer. Due to the revelations, Leia's credibility was tarnished and she was forced to withdraw her nomination for First Senator. After Leia returned to her senatorial office to escape the crowd, a tearful Sella confronted her employer and announced her resignation. She chastised Organa for withholding this information from her and her staff. As a final snub, she slammed Leia for referring to her by her childhood nickname \"Korrie.\"\nTen days after Leia's speech to the Galactic Senate on her mission to Sibensko, Sella met Leia while she was accompanying the Populist Senator Tai-Lin Garr during his public campaign for First Senator. Sella apologized for abandoning Organa out of anger and expressed her admiration for the Senator. She also offered her services to Leia again, which the older woman gratefully accepted.\nAfter Organa resigned from the Galactic Senate and formed a paramilitary organization called the Resistance to oppose the actions of the First Order, Sella went with her and continued serving General Organa. Because Organa, who predicted the threat that the First Order posed to the New Republic, had been labeled as a warmonger and had her reputation damaged by the Senate, Organa used Sella as an envoy between the Resistance and the New Republic. The Republic believed that the First Order would not pose a threat to them so long as they abided by the dictates of the Galactic Concordance, signed nearly three decades earlier by the Republic and the Galactic Empire at the end of the Galactic Civil War, but the Resistance learned that the First Order intended to destroy the Republic. Organa frequently sent Sella to make a case for direct Republic action against the First Order—the Resistance was not officially sanctioned by the Republic but received limited support nonetheless.\nAs the situation grew more dire, and the First Order prepared to use its superweapon known as Starkiller Base against the Republic's capital in the Hosnian system, Organa tasked Sella with traveling to the capital world of Hosnian Prime to once again make a case for Republic action. Sella questioned whether the Senate would listen, and Organa conceded that she did not know—there was a time when the Senate would have been willing to listen, but the political makeup of the body had changed in the years since the New Republic's founding. Though Sella agreed to go, she questioned why the general did not go in person, to which Organa replied that even if she could deliver a speech to the Senate, there were certain members of the government who would ensure that she did not make it off of Hosnian Prime alive. Sella left with Organa's confidence that she would be able to deliver her warnings to the Senate.\nWhile Sella was on Hosnian Prime, the Starkiller targeted the system and fired its phantom energy beam. Sella stood alongside Chancellor Lanever Villecham and members of the Senate and watched in horror as the Starkiller superweapon hit Hosnian Prime, tearing the planet apart and killing Sella and the members of the government along with it. Resistance forces later destroyed the weapon, ensuring that it could never eliminate another planet again.\nKorr Sella was a human female with black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin. She wore a Resistance command uniform. She showed her authority in how she carried herself, preferring a no-nonsense stance. As a teenager, Sella was an idealistic young woman who admired Leia Organa and looked up to the former rebel soldier and New Republic senator. Sella was a diligent office intern who took her job seriously and went out of her way to serve the senator. During her work as an office intern, Sella developed a friendship with Leia's personal pilot Greer Sonnel, who taught her to practice diplomatic courtesies. Informally, Sella preferred to be known by her childhood nickname \"Korrie\" when around her friends like Senator Organa and Sonnel.\nSella was greatly distraught when she learned that Leia was the daughter of the reviled Imperial enforcer Darth Vader. Angered by Leia's perceived indiscretion and dishonesty, she resigned in protest. However, Sella came to reconsider her actions after Leia's investigation uncovered a conspiracy involving Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. Sella later buried the hatchet with Senator Organa and re-offered her services. Leia gracefully accepted the younger woman's services and later assigned her to work as the Resistance's envoy to the New Republic.\nKorr Sella briefly appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. She was portrayed by Maisie Richardson-Sellers.\nA scene was filmed in which Leia Organa tasked her to go to the Galactic Senate and explain the threat of the First Order; this was deleted from the final cut, as writer Michael Arndt and director J.J. Abrams agreed that Leia's reintroduction would be more powerful through Han Solo's eyes later on Takodana. However, Abrams ended up feeling that the Hosnian Cataclysm sequence would have been more emotional had Sella's scene been kept. Nevertheless, Alan Dean Foster's novelization included the scene.\nFurther information about the character was provided in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, elaborating on her role in the Resistance.",
