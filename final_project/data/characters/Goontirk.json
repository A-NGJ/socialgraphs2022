 "content": "Goontirk was a male Snivvian who owned the Madman's Fortune, a museum exhibit ship that he flew as part of a traveling freak show. At some point during galactic history, Goontirk purchased the mummified remains of Vardovin IV, the \"Lost King of Duro,\" from a Ryn merchant. While Goontirk was uncertain as to whether the mummy was authentic, he believed that even if fake, the corpse would be an interesting curiosity for him to carry aboard the Madman's Fortune. However, unknown to Goontirk, the mummy contained more than a dozen skekfish eggs and while the Madman's Fortune was passing through the Engebo system, the mummy's plasteel coffin cracked open and the skekfish eggs hatched. The creatures attacked Goontirk and in an attempt to escape from them, he ran into one of the ship's escape pods. The skekfish followed him in and they devoured the Goontirk before he could launch the pod, killing the Snivvian.",
