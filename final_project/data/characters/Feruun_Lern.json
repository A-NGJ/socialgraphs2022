 "content": "Feruun Lern was a male member of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders during the time of the Mandalorian Wars.\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, Lern became a dominant figure at the outpost Unity, on the planet Caillte, in the Mid Rim. Lern invited people to come to the base, so that they could rediscover the warriors within themselves and established themselves as new Neo-Crusader soldiers.\nLern and many of his followers left Unity at the end of the Mandalorian Wars, to participate in the Battle of Malachor V. The Neo-Crusaders were defeated in the battle and Lern returned to Unity. He and his followers abandoned the base during the Jedi Civil War, to join forces with the Mandalorian Canderous Ordo. Lern and Ordo sought glory by fighting against the Sith during the Dark Wars and Lern was killed during the conflict.\nFeruun Lern was highly regarded by his fellow Mandalorians and by the time of the Jedi Civil War, was viewed by them as a traditionalist.",
