 "content": "Reeayah was a dark side-using female Twi'lek Force Adept who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nReeayah was born on the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth and did not wish to become a slave like many of her species, so she fell in with a group of dark side Twi'lek witches, who taught her the ways of the Force. She later joined the Cularin Pirates and she immediately became obsessed with it's leader Dorel-Kan and they had a very close working relationship. During the Confederation Rock Rush in c. 31 BBY, Reeayah used the dark side to track a ship to an asteroid in the Cularin system asteroid belt. She and the rest of the pirates landed their ship there and attacked the Heroes of Cularin, who had been crewing the ship that they had been tracking.",
