 "content": "\"Stinger\", code-named \"Arrow Nine\" was a clone trooper pilot who served in Arrow Squadron, a Republic starfighter unit, under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, a galactic war between the Separatists and the Republic, Stinger participated in a battle against Separatist forces in orbit above the planet Kothlis. As Stinger engaged tiers of Vulture droids, his starfighter was shot down by one of the Vultures, resulting in the clone's death.\n\"Stinger\" was the nickname of one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Like his fellow clones, Stinger was bred on the planet Kamino. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic, Stinger was part of the Republic starfighter unit Arrow Squadron. Under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, the squadron was stationed aboard the cruiser Indomitable when the Republic fleet to which it was assigned received the order to defend the planet Kothlis from an attack by the Confederate General Grievous. Stinger participated in the following battle against Separatist forces. The defense of the planet proved even more difficult than expected due to Grievous's computer virus, which jammed all communications for the Republic, albeit leaving internal helmet comlinks unaffected.\nUnder Skywalker's command, Stinger and Arrow Squadron boarded their starfighters to engage tiers of Separatist Vulture droids. During the attack, Stinger was pursued by several Vultures and was unable to evade them. As Skywalker made his way toward Stinger to help him, the clone's fighter was shot down by one of the droid fighters, resulting in the death of Stinger.\nStinger was a clone trooper pilot who stood 1.83 standard meters tall. When Stinger died, he briefly felt pain and anger. Skywalker experienced this through the Force.\nStinger was first mentioned in the fourth novel of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars novel series, Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth, which was written by Australian author Karen Miller and released on February 23, 2010. In the novel, Stinger's death is mentioned during a space battle from Anakin Skywalker's point of view.",
