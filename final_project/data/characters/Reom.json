 "content": "Reom was a male Twi'lek and the president of IsoTech, a black-market tech operation. He hired a group of spacers to track down the Sa Nalaor, a missing Munificent-class star frigate, and bring its cargo to his base on Raxus Prime.\nReom often wore jumpsuits and dark gray cloaks, common attire for the locales he frequented. He was equipped with a datapad, a tool kit, and a utility belt, and was armed with a heavy blaster pistol and a vibroknife. He was accompanied by his pet, a bogwing named Mordekai.",
