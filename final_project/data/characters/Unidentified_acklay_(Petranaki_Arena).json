 "content": "While at the Petranaki arena, this acklay was used as the means to execute Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nWhen Anakin Skywalker, Padm√© Amidala, and Obi-Wan Kenobi were captured by Count Dooku on Geonosis, this acklay was selected along with a Reek and a Nexu to be the animals used to execute the three. The three managed to escape from their chains and fought back against the creatures until Mace Windu arrived with reinforcements. At one point, Kenobi managed to stab the Acklay in the neck a stun pike, giving it some pain, only to remove the pike with its mouth and snap it in two. At another point, it also killed a Geonosian who had briefly been knocked out and tried to get out of the way by impaling the Geonosian with its pincers while moving towards Kenobi.\nDuring the fight, Kenobi was found matched up with the acklay for a second time. Now armed with a lightsaber, Kenobi killed the acklay by cutting off its two front-most legs and stabbing its neck.",
