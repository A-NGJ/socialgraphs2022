 "content": "Methias Yoran was a male Human who served in the Imperial Diplomatic Service during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. A skilled diplomat, he personally accepted the fealty of thirty worlds during his lengthy career, and was instrumental in the alliance between the Empire and the Chiss Ascendancy. During the Cold War, he was assigned to the planet Voss, and spent several years there attempting to secure an alliance with the native Voss. Darth Tormen dispatched a bounty hunter to work with Yoran to eliminate General Thelonia Redrish. If the bounty hunter exclusively selects dark side options, then they can convince Ambassador Yoran to commit suicide as they leave Voss.",
