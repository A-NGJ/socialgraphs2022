 "content": "Hillat Temple was a human female pilot who flew for the Galactic Empire and later as a criminal in a criminal organization. She was the oldest child in a family whose military service record stretched back thousands of years. Temple graduated first in her class. She later turned against the Empire and became involved as a pilot and leader in criminal activities, enjoying the challenge of shooting down other ace pilots.\nSeveral months into the Imperial blockade of the Anoat sector, Hillat was recruited by the Smuggler, who sent her on assorted missions.\nIn the 2015 iOS video game Star Wars: Uprising, Hillat Temple was one of the many crew members that could be sent on Crew Runs for helpful items.",
