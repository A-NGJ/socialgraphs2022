 "content": "Zetha was a male Human Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. During the war he sold equipment to other Imperials on board Vaiken Spacedock, a space station of the Imperial fleet.\nZetha was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he serves as an Imperial elite gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
