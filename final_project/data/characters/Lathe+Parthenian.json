 "content": "Excellence Lathe Parthenian was the leader of Libreck city and leader of the Hanoon Imperial Resistance.\nShe and some of her team were imprisoned in an Imperial garrison in their city, but were freed by Leia Organa's forces while liberating the planet.\nShe was very vocal in her opposition to the Empire's tyranny, and was promptly arrested, along with several of her men, by Moff Yittreas' forces for speaking out against them.\nAlthough modestly adept with a blaster, she appears to be reluctant about directly engaging in combat herself.\nLathe Parthenian is voiced by Kath Soucie in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and the Clone Campaigns expansion, where she appears in the Princess Leia campaign, and as a Hero unit for the Rebel Alliance faction. She is mistakenly given the same icon as the male Hanoon Soldier unit, so her true likeness beyond her unit model is unknown.",
