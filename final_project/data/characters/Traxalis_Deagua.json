 "content": "Traxalis Deagua was a male humanoid Sith Warrior of the reconstituted Sith Empire who was active during the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Deagua was among the Sith who were assigned to the Dread Executioners, fighting the forces of the Dread Masters on the moon Oricon during the phase of the conflict known as the Dread War.\nTraxalis Deagua was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of Game Update 2.4: The Dread War. He appeared on Oricon, where he was the Basic Gear vendor for the Sith Warrior class. Deagua and the rest of the class gear vendors at Oricon, along with all other Daily Areas and high-level planets, were replaced by standardized vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; he was replaced by Lord Galall.",
