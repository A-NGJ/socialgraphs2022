 "content": "A constabulary officer was a political prisoner at Stars' End in 2 BBY.\nDuring the Liberation of Stars' End, the stasis booths began to shut down and the prisoners started to emerge. Han Solo recognized the uniform of a planetary constabulary, and requested the officer assist with the ordering of the prisoners. During the breakout, he and a few prisoners held a upper landing in the stairwell against an Espo strike. He also dispatched a few defenders to a lower landing as lookouts.",
