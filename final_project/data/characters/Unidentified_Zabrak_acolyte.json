Trained in the Sith Academy on Korriban, as part of her final trial she was sent was sent into the Valley of the Dark Lords to retrieve the helm of Tulak Hord, a task Harkun deemed impossible. Though the Zabrak survived where many other acolytes did not, she succumbed to madness and was unable to leave the Tomb. Eventually, she confronted another group of acolytes sent on the same errand. Though Lana Beniko initially persuaded her to leave by reciting the Sith Code, the Zabrak eventually struck anyway and killed a wounded acolyte Kagan, before Beniko retaliated and ended her life.",
