 "content": "Lammin was a male Human who served as a chief engineer of the Leveler, serving under Captain Gilad Pellaeon during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nIn 22 BBY, Lammin was present onboard the Leveler where he took care of repairing several machines. It paid him a lot when Gilad Pellaeon complained about problems with the dampers. As Lammin was about to solve a jammed bolt again, he set out around the cruiser to find out what happened. After repairing the dampers, Lammin was awarded by Pellaeon for his success.",
