 "content": "Trago Smusch was a male Trandoshan who worked in the Sanads of Rorkee hotel, in Genarius both as a bellhop and as a casino bouncer. He was locally well-known.\nHe also made some side money working as an informant: Although he could not access to secret information, he was shrewd and noticed too many things others would have liked to keep in secret. In 31 BBY, he noticed some strange activity in the workers of the Dorumaa Excavation simulation, and he concluded that Dr. Shilaea Motacc, who had been supposedly killed in a cave-in there, was really alive.",
