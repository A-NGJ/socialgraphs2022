 "content": "Auk-Waimanu was a Lanai male who served as the captain of the Visitors, a group consisting of the male Lanai population of the Temple Island on the planet Ahch-To. The group spent all of their time fishing and hunting while traveling across the ocean to other islands. Only returning to their home once per month, Auk-Waimanu would deliver their haul of food to the female Lanai and then celebrate with them in a multi-day festival. He wore a blue robe under a flotation vest made from vacullacle shells along with a woven hat. Auk-Waimanu's skin was a mixture of gray and white in color and he had green eyes.\nAuk-Waimanu was created to be a part of the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi; however, the scene he appeared in was ultimately cut before the final release. Despite this, the character still appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released alongside the film on December 15, 2017.",
