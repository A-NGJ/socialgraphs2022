 "content": "This Unidentified Sith Pureblood female was selected as the Sith apprentice to the Falleen Sith Lord Darth Karrid during the Galactic War. In 3640 BBY, she and her Master perished in the Battle of Duro.\nWhen Jedi Master Gnost-Dural, his master's former Jedi Mentor, boarded the Ascendant Spear while the ship was docked at Reaver Station, the Sith female fought Gnost-Dural, with the help of his fellow Sith Apprentice and some help from his master, Darth Karrid. The trio eventually captured Gnost-Dural and began to interrogate him.\nThe Sith Female stayed with the interrogation team while her master and fellow apprentice took control of the Ascendant Spear in order to fight off the Republic Fleet. The apprentice was confused at how powerful Jedi Master Gnost-Dural was with a Lightsaber, after being taught for years that the Dark-Side was stronger than the light, she tried to examine his Lightsaber to see how he won. Gnost-Dural attempted to use this confusion to redeem her to the Light-Side, there was a momentary bond between the two which quickly faded.\nWhen Theron Shan used his connection with the Ascendant Spear to free Gnost-Dural, the Pureblood fled the room, leaving the two interrogators to be killed by the Jedi Master and running to tell Darth Karrid of her former mentor's escape. Gnost-Dural ran after the Pureblood, determined to stop her from alerting her Master, the Apprentice jabbed at the Kel'Dor with her Lightsaber, this action was dodged and the two engaged in a battle which resulted in the Apprentice's death at Gnost-Dural's hands.",
