 "content": "Yimmer was a human pirate who served in a crew that operated a mobile way station under the command of the Dashades Maliss and Sorath, collecting components stolen from starships that were taken away from the Kurost transfer point as part of Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit's scheme to steal from Project Stardust. The station was attacked by Grysks, who captured the pirates and tortured them in an attempt to make them into followers. According to fellow pirate Bleary, the interrogation was more successful on Yimmer than it was on most of the crew.",
