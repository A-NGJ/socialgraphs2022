 "content": "Gumbaeki was a Wookiee chieftain, Master of the Claatuvac Guild, and the leader of Palsaang, a small village on the outskirts of the Wawaatt Archipelago.\nDuring the Battle of Kashyyyk, Gumbaeki's village was attacked by Trandoshan slavers and most of its inhabitants were taken prisoner. To get them back, Gumbaeki enlisted the help of the Jedi Knights Quinlan Vos and Luminara Unduli, along with several of their clones. The ensuing raid was a success thanks to the timely arrival of Vilmarh Grahrk, whom had been smuggling goods onto Kashyyyk on the behalf of the Wookiees.\nHis fate after the battle is unknown, although Vos believed he would possibly evacuate his tribe into caves to avoid Imperials and their Trandoshan allies.",
