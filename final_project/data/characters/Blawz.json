 "content": "Blawz was a Dwuni male who was enslaved with his brother Crodit during the reign of the Galactic Empire and served as a miner in the Pyke Syndicate's spice mines on the planet Kessel. Due to the brothers' small size they were able to fit into the narrowest parts of the mine where other slaves could not go. The pair oddly seemed to enjoy their work.\nIn 10 BBY, the brothers were using portable drill units in the mine when a slave revolt broke out and overthrew the syndicate's enforcers, allowing many of the miners to flee.\nBlawz had orange skin and black eyes. He wore a set of brown robes stained orange with spice as well as metal-capped boots and a compressor pack.\nBlawz first appeared in the 2018 Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
