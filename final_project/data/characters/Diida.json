 "content": "Diida was a female Twi'lek living during the Cold War who was a mother to two daughters, Ce'na and Tivva. Born in slavery, the daughters were separated from their mother at a young age. During the Galactic War the sisters found each other after long years of separation and were encouraged to find their mother as well. However, by the time Tivva learned that their mother was owned by Whuddle the Hutt and traveled to Tatooine to find her, she found only her corpse. Feb'Noota arranged her funeral, which both Tivva and Ce'na attended.",
