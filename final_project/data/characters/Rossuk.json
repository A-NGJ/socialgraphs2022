 "content": "Rossuk was a Trandoshan who joined the Warstalkers, a former mercenary group of Trandoshans that was led by Qyzen Fess during the era in which the Eternal Empire controlled the galaxy. In his efforts to teach his students about the Trandoshan goddess Scorekeeper and the glory of the hunt, Qyzen brought Rossuk and other Warstalkers to the planet Hoth to hunt beasts worthy of rewarding jagannath points. Rossuk scouted the Icefall Plains, finding a number of worthy beasts along the southern and western drifts.",
