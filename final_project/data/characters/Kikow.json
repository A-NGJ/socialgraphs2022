 "content": "Kikow was a pale Ithorian who left his herdship at an early age and eventually settled on Ralltiir. A superb cook with a highly developed sense of smell, he ran a restaurant and had a business trading in culinary herbs and spices. However, this was only a cover for his criminal undertakings. He had a small all-Ithorian organization, the Herd, that smuggled thermal detonators. Kikow worked with the Wookiee Furellas, and modeled his organization on her larger one. He would never harm another Ithorian, but had no such compunctions about those not of his species.",
