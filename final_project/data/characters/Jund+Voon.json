 "content": "Jund Voon was a male Ishi Tib who ran the Wave Works gift shop in the Fathoms resort of Wildwater City on Dac. He was also part of Odanni's criminal organization operating as a dealer in black market merchandise.\nVoon opened up his store within the Fathoms entertainment complex. He made a considerable amount of money selling artistic wonders as well as mementos and aquatic trinkets. His specialty was exotic jewelry forged from underwater materials, and was popular enough to make him both one of the wealthiest and most respected merchants of Wildwater.\nHe was very greedy and took credit for the creations of female Qwohog slave named Kei No Kay, who he kept hidden from his customers. He needed her because he could not create the items he sold in his shop. To customers he put on a very friendly exterior giving free trinkets to children and was willing to offer customers bargains. In reality, however, he was very quiet and customers would often forget he was around until it came time to purchase something.\nJund Voon was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. He was illustrated by Joel Carroll.",
