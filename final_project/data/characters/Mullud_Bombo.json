 "content": "Mullud Bombo was a male Otolla Gungan who resided in the small oceanside city of Kaadara during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, Bombo worked closely with the wealthy socialites of Naboo, handling deliveries and other odd jobs. However, Bombo generally disliked the Naboo, and he garnered something of a reputation for his laziness.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a male Otolla Gungan by the name of Mullud Bombo had set up shop in the small oceanside city of Kaadara on the lush Mid Rim world of Naboo. During his time there, Bombo became acquainted with the socialites of Naboo, and carried out odd jobs for individuals like Sentellus Gavrel, a wealthy patron of his. While Bombo's Gungan bosses believed in placating individuals like Gavrel, Bombo held something of a disdain for the Naboo people on account of what he perceived to be their elitist demeanor. As such, Bombo acquired a reputation for laziness, hiring others to carry out his work.\nSuch was the case when Gavrel requested Bombo to deliver to him a backpack of survey equipment. Instead of delivering the shipment himself, Bombo enlisted the help of a spacer passing through Kaadara. In exchange for a credit reward, Bombo delegated to the spacer the responsibility of carrying the backpack to Gavrel outside of the city. However, the journey was not uneventful. In the wilderness, the spacer was attacked by a native veermok and a wayward Jawa engineer, both of which were dutifully dispatched. Upon receiving the survey equipment, the wealthy patron, who also worked as a farmer, derided Bombo for his lack of work ethic. Regardless, Bombo was quite pleased with how the delivery assignment was carried out, and offered the spacer some medicine to make them feel better after their wilderness voyage. It would not, however, be the last assignment for the intrepid spacer. Bombo further employed the individual to receive from Lady Siyanna Kaelish, a female entertainer, a datadisc containing a list of rich Naboo socialites who were to be invited to a party. Although two Gungan outcasts violently interfered with the transaction, both were dealt with, and Bombo compensated the spacer for resolving the situation. Bombo further employed the spacer to escort another woman, an artisan by the name of Lady Winella Munkus, safely back to Kaadara. Once again, the spacer faced a violent altercation while Bombo remained safely in Kaadara. This time, an aggressive moisture farmer accompanied by a feline narglatch attempted to prevent Lady Munkus from accompanying the spacer on the journey back to city. However, the spacer killed both of them for endangering Munkus' life.\nMullud Bombo belonged to a lineage of the Gungan species known as the Otolla. Like many Otolla Gungans, he had orange eyes and orange, mottled skin. He also spoke a strongly accented form of Gunganese, a language derived from the Naboo settlers' language, Basic.\nAlthough Bombo worked closely with Naboo's wealthy elite, he generally disliked the people of Naboo, because he believed they thought too highly of themselves. The fact that his bosses believed in groveling before individuals like Sentellus Gavrel left Bombo feeling \"sick.\" Regardless, he carried out tasks for people like Gavrel, albeit in a manner which garnered him a reputation for laziness.\nInstead of carrying out deliveries himself, Bombo would employ others to carry out his assignments. This penchant for laziness compelled Gavrel to view him in a less than sympathetic light. Gavrel also felt Bombo was too difficult to understand, due to his Gunganese. Despite his disdain for the wealthier socialites of Naboo, Bombo was appreciative of outsiders who did as they were instructed. The spacer who helped to deliver the backpack of survey equipment, for instance, was duly complemented by Bombo, and even offered medicine for daring to venture out into Naboo's wilderness. Conversely, Bombo was liable to harshly impugn anyone who refused to help him on his assignments. He viewed such individuals as no different than the \"smarty others\" he often worked for.\nDuring his time in Kaadara, Bombo wore a simple brown tunic and pants. The clothing he wore was strikingly similar to that worn by other Gungans throughout Naboo, including Jar Jar Binks, who wore similar attire during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. Mullud Bombo was also stocked with other provisions, like the medicine he offered to the spacer after successfully delivering survey equipment to Gavrel.\nMullud Bombo was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for Bombo had to deliver a backpack to Sentellus Gavrel, receive a datadisc from Lady Siyanna Kaelish, and escort Lady Winella Munkus back to Kaadara. It should be noted, however, that the quest line for Mullud Bombo was rather buggy. While the first quest to deliver a backpack to Gavrel functioned properly, the following two quests lacked any text dialogue strings. This renders it impossible to know the exact context for why Bombo wanted a datadisc from Lady Kaelish, and why he wanted Lady Munkus escorted to Kaadara. Nevertheless, these two quests could still be completed. After completing the first quest, Bombo offered the player some medicine, but no such item was placed in the player's inventory. Furthermore, while the first two quests would award the player with 50 credits, the final quest lacked any reward due to a database error. As part of a Publish 3 update on October 8, 2003, the developers fixed many quest bugs for static quests. At some point during or after this update, the Mullud Bombo NPC was deactivated, and could no longer issue quests to players. Although the player could choose not to do Bombo's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.",
