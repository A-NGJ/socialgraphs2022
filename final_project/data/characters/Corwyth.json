 "content": "Corwyth was a Human male who reigned as the Imperial Governor of the planet Metalorn in 0 ABY. Corwyth's rule was characterized by a tight regimentation of society and a complete control over the flow of information, which led Metalorn's citizens to not even know a Rebellion existed. However, Rebel leader Leia Organa underwent a mission to Metalorn in the hopes of establishing a local resistance not long after the Battle of Yavin, and while she was ultimately unsuccessful, she succeeded in undermining Corwyth's hold on the planet.\nA Human male, Corwyth served as the Imperial Governor of the Mid Rim factory world of Metalorn during the Galactic Civil War. Life on Metalorn was highly regimented and tightly controlled under Corwyth's rule: to further his goal of complete social control, Corwyth partnered with the Tagge Company to install a planet-wide weapons detection system, which coupled with his own information control program and ubiquitous surveillance ensured that the Rebellion did not exist, in any form or fashion, on Metalorn. Corwyth's policy of widespread disinformation convinced Metalorn's populace of a number of untruths, including that the planet Alderaan had been destroyed in a meteor storm.\nThings seemed to be going swimmingly in 0 ABY, when Corwyth was paid the honor of a visit from Baron Orman Tagge, the head of the Tagge Company. However, Tagge's stopover coincided with one by Rebel leader Leia Organa, who came to Metalorn in the hopes of establishing an Alliance presence. Upon reaching Metalorn, Organa managed to overpower a stormtrooper and steal his blaster rifle, setting off Tagge's weapons detection system. Eager to save face in front of the Baron, Corwyth sent dozens of men after Organa, hoping to use the tracking beacon embedded in the rifle to follow her movements. Tagge quietly slipped out of the room when the trouble started, while Corwyth remained locked in on directing the hunt for the Rebel agent, as the chase led into an underground ore smelting plant. To their surprise, however, Corwyth's troopers converged on her location to find that she had ditched the weapon: Organa had lost her tail.\nBut while Corwyth's search proved fruitless, Tagge managed to track Organa down himself, discovering that her plan involved establishing contact with Arn Horada, a local worker who had once taught her galactic history during her youth on Alderaan. Due in no small part to Horada's interference, Organa managed to narrowly escape Metalorn, although without having started any organized resistance. Corwyth was infuriated upon learning Organa had slipped through his fingers, and although he initially wanted to execute Horada, Tagge warned him off, saying that any retaliation would be a tacit admittance that a Rebellion truly did exist. Tagge left Corwyth behind as a chastened and humiliated manâ€”and Organa left Metalorn having, at the very least, planted the seeds of resistance on the planet.\nAs the planet's governor, Corwyth's number one priority was keeping a tight hold on Metalorn's society, and he was extremely confident in the success of his efforts: the mustachioed man dismissed out of hand the idea that Rebel spies could achieve anything on his world, as his use of surveillance technology and social control had stamped out any hope of rebellion up until 0 ABY. However, Leia Organa proved that Corwyth's system was not foolproof, a fact which angered and humiliated Corwyth and drove him to push even harder to track her down. Corwyth was willing to go to violent ends to maintain his hold over the planet, only to be visibly humiliated by Orman Tagge's repudiation of his philosophy and practices.\nCorwyth first appeared in Star Wars  30, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979, where he was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
