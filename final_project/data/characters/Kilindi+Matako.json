 "content": "Kilindi Matako was a young Nautolan female student who attended at the Orsis Academy, and took an interest in young Maul, becoming his friend, and inviting him to go swimming with her. She was once a slave when she killed her entire slave family and escaped before Trezza found her and brought her to the Academy. She and Maul quickly became the school's best students and she and her friend Daleen told Maul a surprise awaited him when he returned from his final test. When Maul returned with orders to kill everyone at the Academy, she was stabbed by the young Sith Lord and died with a smile, rhetorically asking him \"I guess you're not interested in the surprise that Daleen and I had for you.\"",
