 "content": "A Jabiimi Human male served as a soldier in the Nationalist Army of the planet Jabiim during the Battle of Jabiim between the Jabiimi Loyalists and the Jabiimi Nationalists. In the year 22 BBY, he was stationed at the trenches of Outpost Shear, where he and his fellow soldier exchanged Anti-Jedi talk. As they heard the approach of the first-generation All Terrain Armored Transports, they took cover in their trench.\nDuring the Galactic Republic attack on the outpost, he was badly wounded by the ARC trooper Alpha-17. As the Republic forces overran the main emplacement, he was found lying on the ground by the Jedi Master Sirrus and his Padawan Aubrie Wyn, one of the Jedi Temple's best healers. On her Master's motion, Wyn healed him.\nThe soldier had a red beard, blue eyes, and fair skin. During the attack, he wore the blue uniform of Nationalist Army personnel.",
