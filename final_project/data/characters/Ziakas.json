 "content": "Ziakas was a Derriphan who lived in Adarlon's Glow Dome, feeding upon the life essence of females who were dazzled by the light shows in the Glow Dome. One of its hosts was the Glow Dome's co-owner, Kandria A'Daasha.\nZiakas was a parasitic ball of dark side energy that fed and absorbed the essence of its host. Earlier in its 'life' it had almost been destroyed by Jedi. It somehow traveled to the planet Adarlon where it became attached to Glow Dome co-owner Kandria A'Daasha. She had recently been infected so Ziakas' feedings and the blackouts from being controlled were attributed to fatigue and too much partying rather than something more sinister.\nHighly intelligent despite being a ball of energy, Ziakas was more reserved and emotional than others of its kind. It was easily angered but also cautious and wary of Jedi. It preferred targeting females and humanoids over men and aliens. It also preferred to keep a low profile, only hosting and feeding behind closed doors and using memory wipes to make its host forget that it was being secretly controlled.\nAs a Derriphan, Ziakas was powerful in the dark side, especially when it came to powers of control. It could also use the skills of its host by controlling their bodies and reading their memories however once it started absorbing those skills and draining those memories it could not utilize them anymore.\nZiakas was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. It was illustrated by Tom O'Neill.",
