 "content": "Bandor Mokk was a male Bothan who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nBandor Mokk was from the city of Kor Vella on Corellia. He was friend with Kyran Silene. After the Battle of Yavin, a group of Corellian slavers operating near Tyrena captured Kyran Silene and enslaved him. In 1 ABY, Silene and a group of slaves managed to escape the Corellian Slaver Bunker. Kyran Silene contacted Bandor Mokk but the Bothan was watched by Faye Patrick, a member of the slave ring, who threatened his life. Because of that, Mokk, along with Faye Patrick, were suspected to be involved in the increase of missing persons on Corellia. CorSec Major Alana Walden was investigating the case, and pleaded with citizens to report Mokk's location to CorSec.\nKyran's wife, Madison Silene, later recruited a spacer to investigate the disappearance of her husband. The spacer met Bandor Mokk and convinced him to talk about Faye Patrick. The spacer therefore fought and killed Patrick in a street of Tyrena. After the death of Faye Patrick, Mokk accepted to reveal everything he knew about Kyran Silene and the escaped slaves. The spacer eventually met Kyran Silene in a camp outside the city and helped him to reveal the slavery operation to the CorSec.\nBandor Mokk appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Bandor Mokk was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
