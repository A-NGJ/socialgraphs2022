 "content": "Nillika was a Human male who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he worked as the administrator of the Mos Eisley Medical Center. In 1 ABY, many people were caught in a firefight between Lady Valarian's guards and Jabba the Hutt's thugs in Mos Eisley. The 2-1B droid Billingsly sent a spacer to Mos Eisley to help the local medical staff. The droid also sent the medic's profile and payment to Nillika. After the medic had treated the injuries of Escara Frei and Jorund Redd, Nillika handed out 5000 credits and a field surgeon ring to the medic.\nAdministrator Nillika was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Administrator Nillika was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nBecause Administrator Nillika spawned under the generic \"medic_11_admin\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He appeared consistently a Human male, however.\nAdministrator Nillika was part of the low-level quest \"Caught in the Crossfire\" for players of the Medic profession. After the player has treated Escara Frei and Jorund Redd, Billingsly sents the player to Nillika to receive the rewards. In this message, the NPC was erroneously called \"Nillka\".",
