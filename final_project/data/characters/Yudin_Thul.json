 "content": "Yudin Thul was a Human male member of House Thul who was active during the Cold War.\nDuring the Alderaan Civil War, House Thul was invaded by the Killiks. Yudin Thul believed that these creatures could be driven back, so he went to search for answers. In 3642 BBY, he eventually discovered that Killik relics from a nearby ruin could hold important historical information that will help in defeating these natives. After sending a team of researchers to retrieve the relics, Yudin saw that they hadn't returned. He later tasked an Imperial spacer to reach the relics from the Anzaada Cavern.",
