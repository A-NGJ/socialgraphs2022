 "content": "Koval Renge was a male Sith Lord of Human or Sith pureblood descent who served the Sith Emperor of the reconstituted Empire as his Sith Executioner. Using his ceremonial executioner's blade, Renge eliminated hundreds of his master's enemies, but soon grew fearful of the Emperor's power and tried to betray him. The Emperor turned his servant's blade upon its own wielder, breaking the sword and burying a fragment in Renge's chest. After the wounds healed, Renge was then cast into the depths of the Dark Temple on the planet Dromund Kaas with the fragment still within his body.\nKoval Renge was created for the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he is mentioned in the Codex entry for the Blade of the Sith Executioner. The entry is one of three, along with \"Lord Parnax's Lost Recordings\" and \"The Phobis Devices,\" that were intended to be found in the Dark Temple. However, they were removed from the final version of the game, though the Codex entries still exist in the game files and are included in the number of entries in the Lore category listed for Dromund Kaas.",
