 "content": "Tharence Wo was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Golden Age of the Old Republic.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Tharence Wo was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, attaining the rank of Jedi Master sometime during the Golden Age of the Old Republic. Studying independently as a Consular, Master Wo specialized as an anthropologist and was responsible for compiling an abundance of research on the Yinchorri species.\nCrafting a holocron known as the Journals of Tharence Wo, the records became obscure by the end of the Golden Age, lost in the mass of texts held in the Temple Archives on Coruscant. When an uprising began in the Yinchorri system, the Jedi High Council dispatched two Jedi, Naeshahn and Ebor Taulk, to quell the riots; both were murdered and their bodies shipped back to the Temple. It wasn't until Master Yaddle rediscovered the journals in the Archives that the High Council had proper insight into the situation and were able to plan a new strategy for dealing with the conflict.",
