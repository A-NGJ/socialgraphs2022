 "content": "Urup Fal'co was a Mustafarian of the Mensix Mining Company. He was present in the Mensix Mining Facility on Mustafar at the point where the company was suffering a small labor crisis. Many miners went on strike, and refused to talk to company representatives. Urup thus employed offworlders to convince miners to re-enter negotiations with the company.\nUrup Fal'co appeared as a non-player character in the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies, developed by Sony Online Entertainment prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
