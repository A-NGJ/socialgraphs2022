 "content": "Norjax Thall was a professional soldier. He was a member of the Flamestrike Legion until the unit was forcibly disbanded by the Galactic Empire. He joined other mercenary groups but grew disaffected with the nature of the conflicts. He had a stint working security for the New Cov Biomolecule Company but left to work security for an organized crime group. He found that he enjoyed the experience, challenge, and credits that came with the job. Thall was sent to neutralize a Syndicate One but the groups involved managed to resolve the situation. However, Saujutta-Ok-Topii was impressed with the soldier's abilities and Thall was recruited into the criminal organization. He served as a tactics and weapons expert.",
