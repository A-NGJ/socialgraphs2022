 "content": "Scram was a Gloovan gangster who led the Scram Gang during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. At some point between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, Scram played a game of sabacc in a cantina on Rekelos with a Rodian, a Duros, and the Lepi smuggler Jaxxon T. Tumperakki.\nThe game ended with Scram accusing Tumperakki of cheating and tossing the table to chase the Lepi as he fled. Scram managed to grab the smuggler after he insulted the gangster, but Tumperakki kicked the Gloovan in the chin and knocked Scram back. The Scram Gang then entered the cantina and prepared to attack Tumperakki for humilating their boss, but the bounty hunter Dengar opened fire on them before they could attack. In the ensuing fight, Tumperakki managed to escape through the cantina's skylight. Scram was a sore loser with purple skin and blue eyes. The gangster wore a brown outfit including boots and a belt.\nScram was created for \"Rabbit Hunt\", a comic story published in Star Wars Adventures Annual 2020 on November 18, 2020. The character was revealed prior to the release of the comic in preview pages posted to StarWars.com on November 10, 2020. The story was written by Cavan Scott and illustrated by Francesco Gaston.",
