 "content": "Gosular was a male Human commander in service of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War. Around 3642 BBY he was stationed on Hoth, where he was killed.\nGosular appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Hoth. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
