 "content": "Hewex was a male human who served as a Major and a captain in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nDuring the war he was stationed on the moon of Endor in a bunker housing a shield generator which provided protection for the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station battlestation being built in Endor's orbit. The Major, alongside Commander Igar, supported the bunker's commander, Colonel Dyer. During the Battle of Endor, in which the Alliance attacked the incomplete Death Star, a team of Rebels was sent to the moon's surface in order to destroy the shield generator bunker. At first, the Rebels took control of the bunker's control room and held the Imperial personnel, including Hewex against the wall at gunpoint. When Imperial reinforcements arrived, he wrestled the Rebel Chewbacca's bowcaster from him.\nAs the Rebels were led outside, the Imperials were attacked by Ewoks and chaos ensued. Hewex and several other Imperials sealed themselves inside of the bunker as the Ewoks assisted the Rebels fighting the Imperials. Eventually, the Rebel General Han Solo successfully tricked a nervous Hewex into opening the door by posing as Major Newland. Hewex sent several squads of Imperial troopers stationed in the bunker out to aid in the fighting, but found it was a trick and the Rebels entered the bunker. Hewex and the remaining men in the bunker were then forced to surrender to the Alliance soldiers, who planted charges. The Rebels were ultimately successful in destroying both the bunker and the Death Star.\nHewex had fair skin and brown hair.\nHewex was played by Anthony Smee in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi and received no name in the film. He was first identified in the Endor Limited set of the Star Wars Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game with the name then being confirmed as canon by the reference book Ultimate Star Wars.",
