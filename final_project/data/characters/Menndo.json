 "content": "Menndo was a Rodian male who, like most of his species, began his career working as a bounty hunter. However, he later learned that greater profits could be earned with less hassle in the endeavors of assassination and espionage rather than collecting bounties. Menndo worked for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as an expert assassin. He was often hired when a high-ranking political official had to be eliminated, and he was linked to the deaths of several such officials during his career.\nMenndo had green skin and black eyes. After discovering his new career path, he became an excellent assassin. Menndo's name translated to \"poor\" in the Rodese language. He wore a beige jumpsuit with a reddish vest.\nMenndo was created for the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rebellion as one of the playable characters available to the Galactic Empire. In gameplay, Menndo is most appropriately used for assassination missions, and he is also well suited for conducting espionage missions against heavily defended Rebel Alliance systems. Like all of the other minor playable characters, Menndo has a randomly generated chance, through game mechanics, to become Force-sensitive. If that mechanic is generated for Menndo, he can undergo Force training by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader.",
