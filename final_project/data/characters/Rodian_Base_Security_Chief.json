 "content": "The Rodian Base Security Chief was a male Rodian member of Sordaan Xris' hunting operations in the Kashyyyk system at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nHe was part of Rodian Security Command and oversaw the security of Sordaan's Rodian Hunter Outpost. He could often be seen patrolling the area around the station in his VT-49 Decimator. Near the station he met a spacer who agreed to take on the Gotal Bandits that had been a problem for the Rodians since they came to Kashyyyk.",
