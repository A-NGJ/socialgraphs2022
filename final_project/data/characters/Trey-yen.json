 "content": "Trey-yen was a Human male Captain who served the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nAround 3641 BBY, Captain Trey-yen led a strike team on the planet Quesh to place explosives in order to bring down a Sith outpost from below. When the Darth Baras' apprentice interrupted Trey-yen and Corporal Anders, Trey-yen attempted to detonate the explosives in order to destroy themselves the Sith Lord, but for reasons unknown to him the bomb failed to detonate. The Sith Warrior proceeded to kill Trey-yen and his entire squad. Left as the last man standing, Trey-yen futilely tried to detonate the bomb to no avail, before the Warrior choked him to death. After his death, the Warrior discovered that Lord Draahg had the real detonator, which he then used in an attempt to kill and bury the Warrior, since Darth Baras had foreseen that his former apprentice would soon overthrow him.",
