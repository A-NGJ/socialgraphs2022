 "content": "Tinketh Fo, sometimes called \"Boss,\" was a male Pinurquian who served as the planetary leader of Keyorin during the Galactic Civil War. He was an astute pig-faced being. In a mission for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian visited Keyorin and asked Fo to attend the Alliance's First Conference of Free Peoples, and represent Keyorin's interests. Fo showed interest in having a voice in the new galactic government and said he would consider appearing at the meeting.\nAt the conference on the forest moon of Endor, Fo took his place among the other delegates and listened to Mon Mothma and Admiral Ackbar's opening speeches. Fo may have joined the new government.",
