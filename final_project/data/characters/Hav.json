 "content": "Hav was a male Duros hunter who traveled to Varonat with Jivis in order to hunt for Morodin.\nHav, a male Duros, was a wealthy businessbeing. In 8 ABY, he traveled to the planet Varonat to partake in a Morodin-hunting safari alongside a fellow Duros, Jivis. The hunt was led by a Krish, Falmal, and four other hunters rounded out the party; a Thennqora named Tamish, the Saffa Cob-caree, and two Humans, Syndic Pandis Hart and Captain Seoul of Sif-Uwana.\nHav was a wealthy Duros who was bored and looking for excitement, leading to him signing up for a hunting expedition. Despite his wealth, Hav complained that he had to work for his excitement.\nHav first appeared in Timothy Zahn's First Contact, which was published in 1994's Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 by West End Games. First Contact was subsequently reprinted in The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4, Tales from the Empire, and on Hyperspace.",
