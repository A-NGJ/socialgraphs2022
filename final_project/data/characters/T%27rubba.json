 "content": "T'rubba was a male Rutian Twi'lek criminal who was a henchman of a crime lord during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A blue-skinned Twi'lek, T'rubba used two vibroswords in battle, and his lieutenants were known as \"Dead Faced Blasters.\"\nT'rubba appears as one of the possible Henchmen Bounties in the Bounty Contract Week, a recurring World Event added to the massively multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 2.3. T'rubba can be summoned by using Rendezvous Beacon B-12, which appears on the planets Nal Hutta, Ord Mantell, Nar Shaddaa, and Voss. The player has the option to kill him or capture him alive with carbonite, so as a result, this article refrains from assuming which crime lord he worked for, where he was encountered, and his fate.",
