 "content": "Chigo was a Rodian and an ally of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Even before being won over fully to the Alliance's cause, Chigo had run black market goods to dissident worlds for years.\nDuring the blockade of the Anoat sector by the Galactic Empire, Chigo joined the crew of the Smuggler, who dispatched the Rodian on a variety of missions throughout the sector.\nComing from a criminal background and having a preference for defensive tactics, Chigo was lewd and hot-blooded.\nChigo was created for the canon mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam for iOS and Android platforms and released in 2015, where he is a unique 5 star crew member.",
