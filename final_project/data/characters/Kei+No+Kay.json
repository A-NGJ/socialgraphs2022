 "content": "Kei No Kay was a female Qwohog and Wavedancer who worked as a slave for the Ishi Tib Jund Voon. She was forced to make intricate items which Voon sold in his shop, Wave Works.\nSecretly imprisoned by Jund Voon, Kei was the real driving force behind Wave Works' meteoric rise in popularity. She had tremendous skill in art, a talent that Jund discovered and exploited. She spent her time imprisoned in an artificial tidepool tank. Besides crafting jewelry and trinkets, she had a passion for playing the hydroharp. Although imprisoned she was not treated poorly as long as she continued to produce quality merchandise. Kei had a brother named Koll who joined the Rebel Alliance.\nKei No Kay was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. She was illustrated by Joel Carroll.",
