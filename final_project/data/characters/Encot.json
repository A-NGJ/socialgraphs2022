 "content": "Encot was a male Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. He was the sheriff of Anchorhead.\nDuring the Cold War, he asked a Republic-allied individual to help take down the Twin Suns pirates. The pirates were expanding their operations into slavery, and had taken a group of settlers captive. While Encot did not know the location of the slaves, the police had discovered a Twin Suns operation smuggling Czerka droids off-planet in a warehouse nearby. The individual stormed the warehouse and recovered data on the slaves' location. The individual fought their way through the pirates in another warehouse, freeing the slaves.\nEncot is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.",
