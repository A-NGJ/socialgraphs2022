 "content": "Zorba, also known as Zorba the Hutt, was a male Hutt who had ties with the galactic underworld during the reign of Emperor Palpatine and operated out of his palace in the Southern Rim. After seizing low-grade andris spice from the Razzi Syndicate's warehouse, Qi'ra suggested \"squeezing\" Zorba the Hutt to find what he knew of the spice's provenance. He shared his name with Zorba's Back, one of the largest of three stone archways that stood at the entrance of Arch Canyon, on the planet Tatooine.\nZorba was first canonically mentioned in a model sheet created for \"Hunt for Ziro,\" the ninth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' third season, which aired on November 12, 2010. The sheet, credited to Darren Marshall, was included in the special features of the third season's Blu-ray release, showcasing the Twi'lek chorus girls which appeared in the final episode. One of the Twi'lek's headdresses was adorned with a symbol said to be associated with Zorba, however concept art of Oruba the Hutt was included to the side. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Zorba first appeared in the 1992 junior novel Zorba the Hutt's Revenge, written by Paul and Hollace Davids. Despite the fact that he was the father of Jabba Desilijic Tiure in that continuity, no connection was made between Zorba and Jabba Desilijic Tiure's father in canon.",
