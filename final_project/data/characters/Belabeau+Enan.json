 "content": "Belabeau Enan was a male Ithorian, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nEnan was the brother of Vanster Enan, the owner of a chain of cantinas on Cularin. Belabeau owned and operated a Vanster Enan franchise cantina in Tathin, a Cularin trade village.\nBelabeau valued good drinks and spicy food and appreciated the importance of slowing down, to enjoy both of them. He almost never got angry and used his sense of humor and backwards wisdom to respond to most situations.\nIn Shadows in Green, Enan's first name is spelled as both Belabeau and Belebeau.",
