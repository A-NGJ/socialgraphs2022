 "content": "Nadrine was a human female who was a member of the Dreamers. She was an explosives expert behind the Dreamers' method of crafting suicide bombs looking like jewelry. She had a romantic relationship with Staven, the leader of the Dreamers. During a mission to Affadar to expose a corrupt Imperial leader, Emoch Akagarti, who allowed his citizens to drink water that had hazardous material in it, she accompanied Staven, Iden Versio, Gideon Hask, and Kaev to film Akagarti's confession at his water treatment facility. After they succeeded in recording the footage, Nadrine insisted she take more video evidence of Akagarti's extensive fake equipment. However, when Imperial reinforcements arrived and killed Kaev, she attempted to save the other Dreamers, but sacrificed her life in the process. Staven was upset by her death, and was moody for days afterward.",
