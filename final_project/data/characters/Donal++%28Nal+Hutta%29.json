 "content": "Donal was a male Human who lived on the planet Nal Hutta during the Cold War. He had a brother who lived on a farm with his family near the town of Jiguuna, but when Donal's brother was unable to pay protection money to the Fa'athra gang, the criminals killed the man and his family and took over the farm. A furious Donal hired outside help to wipe out the gangsters, and traded a lockbox of valuables in the farm as payment.\nDonal appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he gives players the mission \"Protection\" on Hutta.",
