 "content": "A human woman born on the planet Alderaan, she married a male Alderaanian and moved to the planet Coruscant. She and her husband came to live in an apartment on Level 3204 of the planet, and the pair eventually had two children, Santigo Milon and Anandra Milon. While the woman's husband was away on a trade mission their homeworld was destroyed by the Galactic Empire, and the Alderaanian residents of Level 3204 began to mourn and then riot their loss. The woman kept her children inside and promised them that they would be ok, but as Imperials began arresting Alderaanians across Coruscant she became extremely distressed and despondent. When Stormtroopers eventually came for the Milons, her children escaped in a cleaning droid while she remained to face the Imperials.",
