 "content": "Jhoff was a Human male who served as the traffic control officer aboard the Executor during the Galactic Civil War.\nAt the time of the Battle of Endor, he controlled the traffic around Endor during their fight against the Rebel Alliance. Prior to the battle, Jhoff was onboard the Super Star Destroyer's bridge when the Endor strike team attempted to sneak onto the moon on shuttle Tydirium. When Jhoff asked the shuttle to identify itself, he was soon joined by Admiral Firmus Piett and Darth Vader, who asked for the shuttle's desired landing area, and the Dark Lord of the Sith, after some hesitation due to Vader sensing his son, Luke Skywalker, on board the shuttle, requested for Jhoff to deactivate the deflector shield and let the shuttle make its desired landing on Endor.\nDuring the Battle of Endor, Jhoff was still present on the bridge when Commander Merrejk announced to Piett that the ship was in attack position, but Piett had orders from Emperor Palpatine to only keep the Rebel fleet from escaping, and held the ship's current position. When an A-wing crashed into the bridge, Jhoff was killed along with the rest of the the bridge crew.\nJhoff was played by Adam Bareham.",
