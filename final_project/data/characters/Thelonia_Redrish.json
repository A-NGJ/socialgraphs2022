 "content": "Thelonia Redrish was a female Kuati who served as a General of the Republic Army during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She was stationed on Voss.\nBorn to the Kuat sector's influential Redrish family, Thelonia left her privileged life behind during the Great Galactic War to assist with relief efforts in the Outer Rim Territories. She served for several years as an aid worker, but it was during one of these relief missions that she became trapped on Lan Barell by an Imperial invasion. Witnessing bloodshed firsthand stirred something in Thelonia, she laid down her medkit and picked up a weapon.\nDespite her youth and inexperience, Thelonia's natural charm, selflessness, and bravery propelled her into a leadership position in the resistance movement seeking to take back Lan Barell. That world would only be the first of many she would unite and liberate during the course of the war. Thelonia's efforts were recognized by the Republic after the Treaty of Coruscant and she was awarded the Mark of Victory and the rank of General in the Republic Army.\nAround 3640 BBY, Thelonia was heading the Republic diplomatic effort on the planet Voss. This made her a threat to Darth Tormen's plans, who dispatched the condemned Grand Champion of the Great Hunt to capture her. Working with Imperial Ambassador Yoran, the Champion uncovered evidence that Thelonia was covertly launching strikes against Imperial holdings, in an attempt to convince the Voss to hand her over. However, the general challenged the Champion's evidence at a Voss hearing. She also accused the Champion of being a terrorist and a Mandalorian, the warrior culture that waged war against the Republic three centuries ago. She argued towards the Voss that the evidence was suspect and boasted that at least she undertook the pilgrimage to the Shrine of Healing. Yoran, eager to show the Empire in a good light, volunteered that the Champion undertake the trials. As the hearing was adjourned, Thelonia arrogantly boasted that she spent months preparing for the trials, which she believed the Champion would not survive.\nThelonia did not intend for the bounty hunter to succeed. She convinced a Voss Mystic at the shrine that the Champion would interfere with the coming change to Voss. As the Champion evaded the attempted detainment, Thelonia journeyed to Gorma-Koss and surrendered to the Gormak. She attempted negotiations. While the Gormak king, Jokull, would not listen to reason, a few dissidents among the natives journeyed with her to the Nightmare Lands, where she discovered inscriptions detailing that Jedi and Sith once battled on Voss and exploited the natives. It was her intention to broker peace between Voss and Gormak. However, she was confronted by Champion and was killed.\nAfter defeating Thelonia in battle, the player can choose to let her Gormak allies go , as well as either freeze her in carbonite  or kill her .",
