 "content": "Li-Tan was a female human who served as the executive secretary of Director Roman Herbane. During the Clone Wars, a battle was fought on Lokori between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic, Li-Tan was killed during the fighting after sustaining fatal injuries.\nLi-Tan was a very fashionable woman, having a shimmersilk sheath, and had stylish boots which added to her height. She also wore her long hair tightly pulled back.\nWhen Li-Tan met Jyn Erso, she stared at her in a way which made it seem like she had never seen a baby before. Lyra Erso also suspected that Li-Tan and Herbane had more than a workplace relationship.",
