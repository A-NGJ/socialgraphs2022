 "content": "An overconfident Zeltron gambler attended an invitation-only sabacc tournament on the Hutt Space moon Nar Shaddaa organized by the gambler Zarro Flynn by 3643 BBY.\nAround that year, an individual associated with one of the two opposing governments in the ongoing Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire sent a companion of theirs to attend Flynn's tournament despite it being invite-only. While at the tournament, the Zeltron gambler put up some rare possessions of theirs as collateral on a loan but lost, which was beneficial for the individual's companion, who was there to search for black market opportunities.\nThe gambler was mentioned in the Crew Skill Mission \"Into the Sabacc Pit\" in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, developed by BioWare.",
