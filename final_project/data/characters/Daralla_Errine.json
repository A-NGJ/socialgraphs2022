 "content": "Daralla Errine was a female Human who owned the CrossWind Saloon in Storrd Township on Seregar.\nShe was tall woman who had a no-nonsense, business-like demeanor. She made fair deals, and would return favors. She also was known to hold grudges forever.\nShe made her money during a brief career as a smuggler, but decided to sink all her credits into the CrossWind Saloon. She managed to triple her investment in a short time. Daralla liked to be informed, and kept a close eye on the underworld dealings on Seregar. This was mostly so she could be in position to take advantage of any opportunities. She made a large amount of profits from back-room deals, trades, and smuggling. She hoped to turn the CrossWind Saloon into the center of smuggling activities on Seregar.",
