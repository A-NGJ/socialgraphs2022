 "content": "Phalaf was a male Ventooinan peasant who, along with the Rov Vetter Piin, violently opposed the Satab monarch's rule over Ventooine during the Imperial Period. Known for his driving hatred of the upper class, Phalaf attempted to assassinate Chrysalla, the Satab's favored ward and lover, by throwing a bomb off a rooftop into her carriageâ€”he was foiled by offworlder Han Solo, and taken into custody by the Satab's guard. Phalaf was brought before the Satab at his palace, but rather than be tortured as he expected, the Satab instead used the powers granted to him by the Shadeshine mineral to send Phalaf's metabolism into overdrive with a mere touch, causing death by old age in a man of only around 18 years.",
