 "content": "General Dustil Forell was a male human who served as the head of Support Services in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He and other members of Alliance High Command attended a meeting in the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4 in 0 BBY, where the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon was discussed. He was later part of the Alliance forces that gathered in the Sullust system before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, and attended a briefing on Home One, flagship of Admiral Gial Ackbar.\nDustil Forell was a human male who served as a general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Part of Alliance High Command, he oversaw the Support Services division, which was a thankless task dedicated to the Alliance's anemic transportation network. Forell was part of the Massassi Group based in the rebel headquarters in the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4, where the transportation network encompassed less than a dozen medium freighters and one military-converted light freighter. A classified intelligence document titled Form #49021804-REB that listed Forell as one of the members of the Alliance's Rebel Council was included in the collection of documents that became known as The Rebel Files.\nIn 0 BBY, Forell attended a meeting in the Great Temple where the Alliance High Command discussed information brought to them by the criminal Jyn Erso, who claimed that the Galactic Empire was building a superweapon known as the Death Star, which was capable of destroying planets and that the plans for the weapon, which would reveal a weakness, were being stored on the planet Scarif.\nShe proposed that the Alliance must mobilize to seize the plans, but the council could not reach agreement and so no attack was authorized.\nForell, who had been stood behind senators Vasp Vaspar and Tynnra Pamlo, then dispersed with the rest of the crowd as the meeting ended. Erso ultimately led an unauthorized squad to Scarif to steal the plans, which forced the Alliance to mobilize and engage the Empire at the Battle of Scarif, where they successfully acquired the plans.\nThe Alliance used the plans to destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, after which they entirely evacuated the Great Temple in 0 ABY. In 4 ABY, Forell was among the Alliance forces that amassed in the Sullust system in preparation for an attack on the second Death Star. He was among the rebel leaders who were summoned onto Admiral Gial Ackbar's flagship, Home One, where a briefing on the attack was given. Forell served as one of the leaders of the Alliance Fleet when it traveled to the Endor system and successfully destroyed the Death Star at the Battle of Endor. He survived the battle and, several days after, approached Princess Leia Organa so that she could record a message for the Anoat sector, which had been blockaded by a remnant of the Empire to prevent news of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine's death reaching the sector's occupants. The message gave assurance that the Emperor was dead and that the new, unified Republic, would come to the aid of those being blockaded.\nDustil Forell knew that the meager transportation resources of the Great Temple were inadequate and that an evacuation would strain them to breaking point. He had light skin, brown and gray hair, and brown eyes.\nAt the Great Temple, Forell wore a brown shirt with tan pants and a brown belt. Over the shirt he wore a tan jacket that was part of traditional Alderaanian military livery and a tactician's overcoat that was also part of an Alderaanian custom.\nDustil Forell appeared in the 2017 Anthology Series film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
