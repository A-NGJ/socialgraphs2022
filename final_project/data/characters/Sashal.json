 "content": "Sashal was a Keshiri female who served as a Sith Lady of the Lost Tribe of Sith, one whom sat on their Circle of Lords. According to a source, Sashal was a petite woman, and according to Grand Lord Darish Vol, she was stupid. However, she was an intelligent and powerful woman, hence she served on the Circle of Lords, despite her small stature.\nDuring the Liberation of Coruscant Sashal was one of the many Sith besieged inside the New Jedi Temple. There during the final battle the Sith Lady led a group of fellow Sith to try to kill Allana Solo under advise of Vestara Khai, but they failed, and Sashal and all her fellow Sith were killed.",
