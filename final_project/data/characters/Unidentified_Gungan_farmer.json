 "content": "A Gungan male was a farmer at Kat Saka's farm on the Outer Rim planet Batuu. He was born around 21 ABY, and became a harvester of purple Surabat grain under the direction of his farmhand group's leader, Jac Lodain, along with his groupmates Shari and a Sullustan.\nThe farmers were surprised when their former colleague Julen Rakab brought the smuggler Izal Garsea to Saka's farm around 34 ABY. The Gungan was curious about the visitor's job, and impressed that she owned her own starship, the light freighter Meridian. As he spoke to Garsea, she noted that his accent reflected that of the other farmers. The Gungan and Shari entreated the smuggler to stay on the farm to work, though she declined. After the group ate together, Garsea entertained the farmers by relating a tale of how her ship had run out of fuel and was saved by the Frinn Mak Traveling Circus.\nThe farmer first appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida CÃ³rdova.",
