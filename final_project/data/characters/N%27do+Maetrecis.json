 "content": "N'do Maetrecis was a male Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a major in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. During the year 20 BBY, Maetrecis fought in a battle on the planet Drongar. He was badly wounded there and, because of shrapnel, needed a heart transplant immediately. The surgeons succeed in the operating room, but an unexpected infection threatened his life. In response, Doctor Zan Yant used bota—a plant found on the planet with substantial medicinal qualities—to save Maetrecis's life, although such an action was illegal.\nThe character of N'do Maetrecis appeared in MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, the first novel of the MedStar Duology. Battle Surgeons was written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004. Later, the major received an entry in the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.",
