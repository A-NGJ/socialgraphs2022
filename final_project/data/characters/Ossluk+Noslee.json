 "content": "Ossluk Noslee was a particularly skilled male Gand warrior. Considering that—as in their traditional culture—most Gand never earned a name of their own, the fact that he had earned two was a testimony to his accomplishments. Later, near the end of the Dark Wars, some individuals believed that a certain pair of gloves once belonged to Noslee, although they were no longer in his possession at that time. The gloves were valuable and augmented the user's combat abilities.\nIn the cut content of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, the Jedi Exile—the player character in the game—was tasked to fulfill a side quest called \"Naming of the Gand,\" in which a curious Sullustan on Nar Shaddaa would ask the Exile to find Ossluk's name. Upon finding the Gand, Ossluk would reveal his name, though he would ask to keep it as a secret. Although the quest was cut from the game, an item called \"Ossluk's gloves\" is still obtainable in the game through a merchant or random drop.",
