 "content": "Downey was a lieutenant and commando who served in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Lieutenant Downey fought and was killed in the Battle of Hoth alongside Sergeant Scott. The two of them watched over one of several entrances into Echo Base.\nIn 3 ABY, Lieutenant Downey watched over one of several entrances into Echo Base. Downey was a Rebel commando, and guarded the entrance into Echo Base alongside another Rebel commando, named Sergeant Scott. When guarding the base, Downey was equipped with a cold weather headgear, gloves, and backpack. When the Galactic Empire infiltrated Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth, Downey and Scott were killed by Imperial forces.\nDowney was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Downey was introduced to the game during Chapter 11 of November 20, 2008. This Chapter introduced the Battle of Echo Base heroic encounter.\nPlayers of the Imperial faction who partook in this heroic encounter were required to infiltrate Echo Base alongside Imperial snowtroopers. When players entered the base, Lieutenant Downey and Sergeant Scott could be seen watching over the entrance from an elevated observation post. If players did not kill either Scott or Downey, the snowtrooper NPC's would do so themselves, in the process of taking over the base. Therefore, their deaths are considered canon. In the game, Downey was referred to as Lt. Downey, and examining the NPC revealed Downey to be a Rebel commando.\nScott Downey was an artist who worked on the Battle of Echo Base heroic encounter for Sony Online Entertainment. However, no relation between him and the characters Scott and Downey has been mentioned.",
