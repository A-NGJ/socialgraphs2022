 "content": "Fadulk Di'keer was a male Bothan information broker who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nFadulk Di'keer was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Fadulk Di'keer spawned under the generic \"bothan_information_broker\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a male Bothan or a female Bothan. Because the quest dialogue identified Di'keer as male, this article assumes that the male Bothan depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
