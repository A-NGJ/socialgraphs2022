 "content": "Wesner was a Human male who served in the Mantellian army during the Cold War with the Sith Empire.\nDuring the latter stages of the Cold War, Wesner was stationed on Ord Mantell, where he achieved the rank of Private and served as part of the Thirty-first Recon from Fort Garnik. While on Ord Mantell, he and squad-mates helped the Republic loyalists near Drelliad village hold back the separatist forces. He told a sergeant and smuggler about the separatist snipers who were hounding the path to Fort Garnik, and about the reward that Commander Vray was offering for anyone who could stop the snipers.\nWesner appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, as part of the mission \"Snipe Hunt\" on Ord Mantell. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.",
