 "content": "Duncan Hikmat was a Human male from the planet Stobar who served the Bespin Wing Guard as a cloud car pilot during the Galactic Civil War, around 3 ABY. At some point during his life, Hikmat was featured in Action Tidings and Figg Daily Bulletin after apprehending a group of Moogan art smugglers. He co-piloted one of two Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud cars near Cloud City in 3 ABY when the Millennium Falcon arrived there. One Cloud Car fired warning shots at the freighter before escorting it to a landing platform.\nThis character's co-pilot, Jell Spiel, was most prominently seen as an action figure in Kenner's The Empire Strikes Back toy line, though both pilots can be briefly glimpsed inside the Cloud Cars in the film. Close up photos of the Cloud Car prop used in the film shows two different pilots inside the pods, with then unnamed Hikmat distinguished by a mustache. In 2010, Hasbro released an action figure based on this particular character, though the packaging mimics the original Kenner figure's, using the photo of the other pilot. Hikmat's name and personal history were finally revealed in the Rogues Gallery feature of Star Wars Insider 148.\nThe figures' full uniforms were based on concept art by Nilo Rodis-Jamero, which was later used to represent Rebel Alliance officer Kem Monnon in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe.",
