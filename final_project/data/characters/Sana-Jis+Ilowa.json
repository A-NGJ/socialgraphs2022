 "content": "Sana-Jis Ilowa was a female Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order during the final years of the Republic Classic era. Like many Jedi of the era, Ilowa took up the rank of General during the Clone Wars. She was killed during the Battle of Jabiim by the Separatist Droid Army.\nA Force-sensitive female Human, Sana-Jis Ilowa was a member of Jedi Order during the laste years of the Galactic Republic. After training in the ways of the Force, Ilowa eventually became a Jedi Knight.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, Ilowa dutifully accepted her role as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic to counter the droid army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war, Ilowa was assigned to assist in the massive defense of Jabiim. During the fighting, Ilowa was stationed at Shelter Base with fellow Jedi Dalnus Cam and Rallcema Bylissura. The Separatists laid waste to the base, ending Ilowa's life.\nIt is possible Ilowa was the female Human Jedi who, while using the Force in an attempt to free a Republic walker stuck in the mud, was stabbed in the back with a sword by Alto Stratus, but that may have also been Rallcema Bylissura. Alternately, either Ilowa or Bylissura may have been the female Human Jedi who incorrectly reported all clear at Shelter Base just before the Separatist attack.",
