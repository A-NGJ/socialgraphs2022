 "content": "Sherruk was a Human male Mandalorian Rally Master who fought in the Mandalorian Wars. He was killed on Dantooine by the amnesiac Jedi Padawan Revan at Jon's request.\nFollowing the end of the war, he led a group of Mandalorian and Duros bandits  to Dantooine, where they terrorized and extorted the local settlers. However, his group of bandits was too small to pose a threat to the Jedi Enclave or any other well-organized defense. Future Mandalore Canderous Ordo was disgusted by him, his followers, and other Mandalorians like him, saying that they were taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.\nIt was rumored he received support from the Sith; this would make sense as he killed Jedi and made the locals distrustful of their supposed protectors. As a Jedi hunter, Sherruk enjoyed eliminating Jedi and taking their lightsabers as trophies. He is known to have killed two Jedi; one with a red lightsaber and one with a blue lightsaber.\nIn 3956 BBY, Sherruk and his companions were killed by a reformed Revan, though the former Sith Lord did not find it easy, as Sherruk proved a very skilled fighter.\nHis name is spelled both Sherruk and Sheruk in the game. Sherruk is found in the southern end of the Grove after all other Mandalorians on Dantooine are eliminated, excluding the ones accompanying him.",
