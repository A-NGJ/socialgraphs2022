 "content": "Moplin Jarron was a male Sullustan who ran Heff's Souvenirs at Mos Eisley. He bought the place when Heff died. Since the shop was basically a junk store and the tourist trade during the Civil War was too low on Tatooine to make a living from the shop, Jarron got his primary income from his ability to forge documents such as IDs and passports.",
