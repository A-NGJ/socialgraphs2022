 "content": "Zade Kalliday was a male smuggler who operated from the starship Midnight Blade. When attempting to smuggle cargo onto Batuu, Kalliday was stopped by the First Order, who seized his cargo and killed his partner, Valoss. After landing on Batuu, Kalliday visited Oga's Cantina, where Vi Moradi saved him from First Order stormtroopers. Kalliday later joined Moradi's group of Resistance fighters.\nZade Kalliday was a heavy drinker and very charismatic. Vi Moradi recruited him to the Resistance because of his charisma and ability to recruit sympathetic people to their cause. Zade acted as though he cared about nothing but himself and harming the First Order, but he was once close with the Devaronian smuggler Valoss and hesitant to care about others for fear of losing them similarly. However, he bonded with the Chadra-Fan mechanic and slicer Kriki.",
