 "content": "A human female lived on the planet Alderaan during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign. She at some point in her life had a child, who married and had two children on the planet Lothal. When the eldest of the woman's grandchildren, Moreena Krai, was fourteen, the Empire took the family's farm on Lothal so that the land could be used to expand mining operations. The woman's child's family then decided to move to Alderaan to live with her, but before leaving Krai told her friend Ezra Bridger where they were going.\nMoreena Krai's grandmother was first mentioned in Ezra's Gamble, a junior novel written by Ryder Windham and released in 2014. The book did not identify which side of Krai's family the grandmother was on, and also did not give her a name.",
