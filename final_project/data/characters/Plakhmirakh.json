 "content": "Plakhmirakh was a Noghri male bodyguard in the employ of Talon Karrde's organization and worked closely with the smuggler and information broker's many agents, most notably Moranda Savich. In 19 ABY he was assigned to guard Savich as she delivered an information packet to Karrde on the world of Cejansij. During the delivery, Savich and the Noghri were accosted by five blaster-wielding thugs; the timely intervention of Luke Skywalker allowed him to take down their antagonists quickly.",
