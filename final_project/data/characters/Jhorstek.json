 "content": "Jhorstek was an Abednedo male black market technician who lived during the Imperial Era. While searching for Nakano Lash, around the year 3 ABY, the bounty hunter Boba Fett found Jhorstek and interrogated him. Jhorstek provided the location of the graveyard planet Galmerah, and Fett killed him. Another bounty hunter named Beilert Valance watched a scan of Jhorstek's interrogation and although the audio of it did not work, he read the Abednedo's lips to find out the location.\nJhorstek was an Abednedo male black market tech dealer who operated during the Imperial Era. Sometime after 10 BBY, Jhorstek was invited to a cantina in Phelar Port on the planet Eriadu by the Nautolan bounty hunter Nakano Lash. While they sat at a table with the twins T'ongor and T'onga, a young thief was caught by the bartender while evading stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire. Jhorstek warned Lash not to intervene as the Nautolan expressed sympathy for the boy. T'ongor sided with Jhorstek, saying that the thief was not their problem.\nAs Lash insisted that they help the boy, another bounty hunter in the cantina, the cyborg Beilert Valance, attacked the stormtroopers as they approached the thief. As Valance defeated the troopers, Lash left the table where he, Jhorstek and the twins were sat. Jhorstek asked the Nautolan what she was doing, to which she insisted that Valance would get himself killed when Imperial reinforcements arrived. Valance took the fight outside the bar, where he was confronted by the subsequent stormtrooper reinforcements, who gunned him down. Lash, then attacked these stormtroopers, defeating them with ease. Jhorstek asked if Lash wanted him to fix the injured Valance. Lash agreed, telling the Abednedo to put it on her account.\nSometime after, Valance, Lash and T'ongor were hired by Khamus, the heir to the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, for mission. Lash, however, betrayed and killed Khamus, going into hiding after. T'ongor subsequently died as well, with T'onga blaming his death on Lash, who went into hiding. Around 3 ABY, Lash was spotted near the planet Kessel, prompting many bounty hunters to begin searching for her. The bounty hunter Boba Fett, who Khamus had also hired on the day of his death, found Jhorstek at the Safe House outside Phelar Port on Eriadu. Killing the other patrons at the bar there, Fett interrogated Jhorstek. Jhorstek revealed a connection between Lash and the graveyard planet Galmerah, and Fett killed him after.\nValance arrived at the Safe House shortly after, finding Jhorstek among the many dead at the bar. Nine-Four-El, Valance's droid accomplice, identified Jhorstek and Valance reminisced the day he met the Abednedo. After remembering this, Valance sliced the Safe Houses security systems, finding a recording of Fett killing the patrons and interrogating Jhorstek. Although he could not hear what the tech dealer was saying, the cyborg read his lips on the recording and realized that he was saying Galmerah. Valance departed for the graveyard world thereafter.\nJhorstek had brown skin. When a thief was being chased by stormtroopers at Phelar Port, he insisted that Nakano Lash did not get involved, wanting to avoid Imperial prison. When Lash rescued the injured Beilert Valance, Jhorstek second guessed that he would need to fix the cyborg.\nJhorstek wore a white shirt with a blue jacket over it and dark colored trousers with a belt. He had a cybernetic left eye that glowed red.\nJhorstek first appeared in Bounty Hunters 2, a comic written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Paolo Villanelli, and published by Marvel Comics on March 25, 2020.",
