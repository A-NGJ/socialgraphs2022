 "content": "Serdo was a male Twi'lek pilot who owned the yacht Firerider, which he used as part of a charter service for wealthy clients.\nSerdo had a reputation for being a trustworthy and reliable being, however his charter business with the Firerider was in reality a cover for his spice-smuggling operation. His high profile clients provided the perfect shield against customs agents, counting on the fact that most customs officials would not chance inconveniencing a Moff, a powerful executive or a high-ranking military officer with anything more than the most cursory of customs inspections. After retiring, Serdo sold the Firerider to a Bith named Fizzi, who owned a dealership on Trevi IV.",
