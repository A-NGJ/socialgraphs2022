 "content": "Franges was a male Human who served as a captain in the Imperial Army of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. Serving on the planet Quesh during the Quesh war, Franges was stationed at the Empire's forward outpost where his forces intercepted a transmission from the Three Families about an experimental formula being moved to the nearby Attis Station for testing. An adrenal and stimulant addict, Franges sought to acquire it for himself before giving it his troops, and so recruited Imperial forces to retrieve the formula.\nCaptain Franges appears on Quesh in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, where he gives Imperial players the mission \"Adrenal Appropriation.\"",
