 "content": "This Jakku villager was a female human member of the Church of the Force, who lived in the Tuanul village on the planet Jakku. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, the villager was present in the village when it was attacked by sixty stormtroopers of the First Order, who were searching for the village resident Lor San Tekka and the map fragment he possessed. The villager and her baby were then caught by FN-2187 during the attack, but he spared their lives before their capture.\nThis character is portrayed by Sasha Frost in Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens. Despite the scenes of the villager's encounter with FN-2187 were cut from the theatrical version, her role was confirmed in the movie's credits. She later appeared in the Junior novelization of the film by Michael Kogge, as well as the graphic novel adaptation. The latter noticeably provides a different version of the scene, as the villager wears entirely different attire and does not carry an infant or anything in her arms at all.",
