 "content": "Bli'Mora was a male Cerean and a member of Nirama's criminal Organization who worked on the Darkside asteroid station. He was mostly a paranoid, disgruntled, austere person who did not like to drink even in the traditional drunkenness of paydays. Bli'Mora disliked Nirama, which would make him a prospective member of the faction wanting to outs him, The Cell. However, Bli'Mora thought that the Cell members in Darkside, including Jasper, were incompetent.",
