 "content": "Jariad Korsin was a male Human High Lord of the planet Kesh's Lost Tribe of Sith in the years following the Great Hyperspace War. The son of Sith mineralogical corps members Devore and Seelah Korsin, Korsin was just an infant on board the Sith dreadnaught Omen when it crashed on the remote, isolated world of Kesh after a Jedi attack at the height of the Great Hyperspace War. Korsin survived the disaster along with his parents, though soon after the crash Devore died at the hands of his brother, Omen captain Yaru Korsin, after an attempted power grab. The survivors soon took dominion over the planet's Keshiri natives and established the Lost Tribe of Sith, with Yaru at its head. Although Korsin's mother married Yaru in an effort to secure Korsin's future, she never lost a burning hatred of the former naval captain for Devore's death, and raised Korsin to share that fury.\nTogether, Korsin and his mother plotted for years to wreak their vengeance upon Yaru and install Korsin as the new Grand Lord of the Lost Tribe. In the meantime, Korsin became an extremely prominent figure in Keshiri society, using political flair and savvy to establish himself as a popular choice for future Grand Lordship, and using his superior lightsaber skills to lead the Sith Saber honor detail—which he secretly trained as a strike force in anticipation of his and Seelah's uprising. In 4975 BBY, they finally decided it was time to strike. Attacking the now-aged Yaru near the mountain-based Kesh Sith Temple, Korsin and his Sith Sabers gained the upper hand and severely wounded the Grand Lord. However, the timely arrival of Korsin's half-sister Nida and her uvak-riding Skyborn Rangers, fighting on Yaru's side, turned the tide of the battle, and Korsin eventually died in combat.\nA Human male, Jariad Korsin was born circa 5000 BBY to Sith mineralogical corps members Devore and Seelah Korsin. That year, at the height of the Great Hyperspace War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the infant Korsin accompanied his parents on a Lignan mining mission to the planet Phaegon III's largest moon. Korsin and his family went aboard the Sith starship Omen, captained by Devore's half-brother, Yaru Korsin. However, the Omen came under attack by Jedi, causing it to veer off-course as the vessel jumped to hyperspace. As the ship headed to parts unknown, a gravity well tore the Omen apart, and the Sith dreadnaught reverted back to realspace toward a mysterious world known as Kesh. Korsin survived the disaster in his mother's arms, and as chaos erupted aboard the Omen, Devore ordered his wife to take Korsin with her to the escape pods. The escape pods were completely inaccessible, however, and instead, Seelah brought Korsin with her to the bridge, where the ever-volatile Devore was fighting with his brother over the ship's controls. After everyone took cover, the Omen hurtled into Kesh's atmosphere, eventually smashing into a mountain range.\nAlthough the ship was destroyed, the infant Korsin, along with his family, survived the crash. Among 355 survivors, the Korsins made their way to a clearing below the crash site, a treacherous journey in which twenty-one perished. Those who remained set up a rudimentary camp, where Korsin spent more time with Devore while his mother focused on treating the injured and sick. Not long after the crash, Devore made an ill-fated attempt to wrest control of the group from Yaru, leading to a lightsaber duel and Devore's death. Korsin and his mother were kept unaware about the circumstances of Devore's demise, which had occurred away from the camp near the remains of the Omen. Through the chance arrival of an indigenous Keshiri woman, Adari Vaal, the Sith were able to escape their entrapment in the mountains, posing as the native gods to gain the allegiance of the Keshiri masses. The Sith were moved into the homes of the Keshiri ruling council, the Neshtovar, and Korsin lived with his mother and Yaru in Neshtovar leader Izri Dazh's house. Although the Sith were eager to find a way off the remote planet, they soon found there was none, and Korsin grew up in isolation from the rest of the galaxy.\nIn the coming years, the survivors of the Omen crash formed a new Sith organization known as the Lost Tribe of Sith, with Yaru firmly at its head as Grand Lord. Korsin's mother married Yaru and bore him a daughter, Nida, in an attempt to secure the future of herself and her son. As a result, Korsin was brought up in relative luxury, first in the capital city of Tahv and later in the Kesh Sith Temple high in the mountains near the Omen's wreckage. At some point, Seelah came to believe that Yaru had been responsible for Devore's death and instilled in Korsin a burning hatred for his stepfather. Together, they plotted to get their revenge on the Grand Lord and place Korsin at the helm of the Lost Tribe. One of their first objectives was to remove the pureblood Sith element from the Lost Tribe, in an effort to instill an all-Human purity in the group. In 4985 BBY, Korsin's mother was at the forefront of a conspiracy to frame the few purebloods who still remained in the Tribe for several massacres of Keshiri in the southern towns of the Ragnos Lakes region, actually engineered by Seelah herself. The misdirection was a complete success: Yaru became convinced of the purebloods' complicity in the deaths and ordered a wholesale purge of the beings from the face of Kesh. The genocide lasted a single night, toward the end of which the pureblood leader, Ravilan Wroth, was captured and held in a public plaza in Tahv. After a short, tense conversation between Seelah and Wroth, Korsin leaped from the shadows, wielding a vibroblade. He then drew his lightsaber and killed Wroth.\nAs Korsin grew into a man, he gained a reputation as something of a wild child, which he would shed as he came of age and became a popular choice to succeed Yaru as Grand Lord. Around 4975 BBY, now–High Lord Korsin founded the Sith Sabers, a ceremonial honor detail that specialized in lightsaber feats, placing himself as head with Yaru's blessing. That year, with all endeavors to find a way off Kesh foiled, the Lost Tribe of Sith decided to commit to staying on Kesh for good. Their intentions were announced in a massive celebration in Tahv's Circle Eternal plaza. The ceremony featured a demonstration by the Sith Sabers, led by Korsin. By then, Korsin's mother had grown absolutely certain that Yaru was responsible for Devore's death twenty-five years prior, and as the celebration drew to a close, Seelah assured Korsin that their time for vengeance was at hand. Over the past several weeks, Korsin had ramped up heavier combat training for his Sabers, whom he meant to serve as his strike force. After the ceremony, Korsin enacted the first part of their plan—misdirection. Korsin would stage a practice duel with his Sith Sabers in front of Yaru, soundly thrashing them, then proclaim that he was taking them to the distant Northern Reaches for training. That would ensure that Yaru, even if he did suspect that Korsin and Seelah were up to something, would not expect them to strike anytime soon. The phase went off without a hitch—Korsin went so far as to sever one of his Sabers' hands, and soon got his stepfather's permission to remove his Sabers to the Northern Reaches.\nLater on, while Yaru paced the Kesh Sith Temple accompanied by his Houk friend Gloyd and four bodyguards, Korsin gathered his Sabers and ambushed his target. Before Yaru could react, Korsin had him surrounded, outnumbered four-to-one. Seelah soon appeared and joined the standoff, but as the two sides faced each other down, suddenly dozens of uvak beasts rose to the sky. As it happened, a secret Keshiri resistance group headed by Adari Vaal had chosen that moment to carry out their final plan, which involved the theft of the uvak beasts vital to Sith dominion over Kesh. The rise of the uvak provided just enough of a diversion to allow Yaru to break the circle and flee to better ground. A full-scale lightsaber duel was on. Although Yaru battled back valiantly, his force was dwindling, and he began to lose strength. Korsin finally cornered the Grand Lord near a high precipice and released all his anger, furiously slashing at him again and again. However, as Korsin moved in for the kill, his sister Nida suddenly appeared on uvak-back with members of her Skyborn Rangers riding club. Nida and her Rangers were the last trick up Yaru's sleeve, and they flew into the fray and turned the tide of the battle. Korsin fought his sister in a desperate attempt to repel their advance, but he himself was wounded. In his last moments, Yaru attempted to throw Korsin over the precipice—although the Grand Lord failed, Nida did it instead, and Korsin fell to his death. With Korsin's slaying, Seelah's plots were completely foiled. Yaru soon died from his injuries, and Nida Korsin took over the mantle of Grand Lord.\nInfluenced by his mother from a young age, Jariad Korsin always harbored a burning, homicidal hatred of his stepfather, Yaru Korsin. Korsin was very loyal to his mother, killing at her command as early as his teens. Although once a wild child, Korsin matured somewhat as he entered his twenties and gained a certain political savvy—he carried himself in public with a resolute swagger, making every pause a pose for history. Although he never knew his biological father, Devore, Korsin took after him greatly. Self-absorbed, Korsin was apt to cut corners just as his father was, either doing nothing or overdoing it. Korsin saw himself as the future of the Lost Tribe and was quick to proclaim that destiny to his stepfather as he faced him down near the Kesh Sith Temple, before their fateful battle. Ultimately, it was these traits inherited from his father that doomed Korsin to his demise, as he was thrown to his death from the same precipice where Devore had met his end. Nearly a third of a meter taller than his stepfather Yaru, Korsin had tan skin and jet-black hair.\nBoth of Jariad Korsin's parents were Force-sensitive, and Korsin inherited that quality from them at birth. Growing up in the Lost Tribe, Korsin was trained in the dark side, and by his teen years he had become adept with both a lightsaber and a vibroblade. By the time he reached his twenties and had become the head of the Sith Sabers, Korsin's skill with a lightsaber had improved greatly; he was able to dispatch multiple armed attackers without exerting much energy. However, his saber skills, as excellent as they were, were not sufficient to prevent his death in 4975 BBY. In that fateful battle, Korsin's incompetence as a trainer reared its head, as his Sabers found themselves unprepared for the fight. Korsin was a capable uvak-rider, as the winged beasts provided the primary mode of transportation for the Lost Tribe in his time.\nJariad Korsin first appeared as an infant in John Jackson Miller's 2009 eBook, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, the first in his nine-part Lost Tribe of the Sith series. Korsin went on to appear in the series' next three installments—Skyborn, Paragon, and Lost Tribe of the Sith: Savior—dying in the latter work. He was also mentioned in two subsequent installments, Pantheon and Secrets, as well as in the 2012 reference book The Essential Reader's Companion.",
