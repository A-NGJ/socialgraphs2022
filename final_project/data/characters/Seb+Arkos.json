 "content": "Seb Arkos, nicknamed Arky, was a male Human Corellian criminal who specialized in forgery of documents. He was of tall but lanky stature. Arkos was originally caught by Hal Horn and eventually sentenced to an unknown amount of years of hard labor in the Spice Mines of Kessel. On Kessel, he joined a group around Booster Terrik, who had also been caught by Horn and sent to Kessel two years earlier. Arkos eventually escaped from Kessel and tried to hide on Darkknell, where he again offered his service of forgery. Moranda Savich tried to get new passports from him in order to vanish from Darkknell.",
