 "content": "Triv Blago was a Faust male beast-trader who lived and operated during the High Republic Era. At one point, Blago hired the Tholothian saber-for-hire, monster hunter, and former Jedi Ty Yorrick to capture a gundark on Blarrum. Yorrick, however, was unable to take the creature alive due to the interference of a Segredo who had followed her, wanting to see her in action. When she returned to Kul Kenada Spaceport with the gundark's head, Blago became furious and shouted that she had cost him a fortune. He ordered his guards to shoot her, but was interrupted by the arrival of two Jedi who sought to arrest him for illegally capturing and transporting dangerous animals. While the Jedi fought Blago's guards, Yorrick escaped, kicking over some of his animal cages, before the Jedi subdued the trader and took him into custody.",
