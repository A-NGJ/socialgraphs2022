 "content": "Har Fuggaw was a male Rodian sabacc ringer working for the casino of the Sanads of Rorkee hotel. Considered to be the best of all the ringers in that casino, he was so confident in his skill that he did not feel the need to cheat. He had no prejudice against using his superior skills to clear out off-guard amateurs and, because of that, he was disliked by his workmate Barma Fel'Lona.",
