 "content": "A clone trooper served in the Grand Army of the Republic's 327th Star Corps during the Clone Wars. Throughout his service, the clone saw Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress cut down entire battalions. During a mission to Escander, the trooper assumed command of the 327th after Clone Marshal Commander CC-5052 \"Bly\" was injured.\nAs a clone trooper, the soldier understood he was not programmed and therefore was able to learn from his personal failures and decisions. Indeed, the trooper also had a habit to disobey orders if it meant saving the lives of his allies.",
