 "content": "In 17 ABY, a Gotal was present in the Crystal Jewel casino on Coruscant, the galactic capital, when an explosion occurred nearby. The shockwave damaged the casino, and, believing it signified an attack on the capital, many of the casino's patrons fled the premises. Directly ahead of this Gotal was Han Solo, a New Republic general, who stopped suddenly outside of the casino, causing the Gotal to collide with him from behind. The Gotal shoved Solo, but then realized why the Human had stopped: The skies of Coruscant were clear, indicating no assault had occurred on the planet. The Gotal exchanged words with Solo and another patron over the possible location of the explosion, with the Gotal excluding anywhere above them as the source; in actuality, the explosion had occurred in the nearby Senate Hall.\nThe Gotal patron appeared in the 1996 novel The New Rebellion, which was written by Kristine Kathryn Rusch.",
