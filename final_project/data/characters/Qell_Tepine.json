 "content": "Qell Tepine was a male Human, who lead the mercenary army Star's Nova during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, Tepine and Star's Nova worked extensively for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He once co-operated with Airen Cracken during an operation on Lianna to sabotage the Galactic Empire's efforts to design and construct the TIE/In interceptor. They were barely able to escape with their lives, but pushed by the completion of the interceptor by several months.\nHowever, Tepine and Star's Nova later worked against the Alliance's successor, the New Republic, by carrying out assignments for the Empire, the pirate Safonne Pendon and the crime lord Jor Idrall. During one assignment, Tepine and a Star's Nova strike team infiltrated a New Republic base in the Farseen system, allowing the Empire to capture the facility.\nTepine loved money and would work for whoever paid him the most.",
