 "content": "Amit Noloff was a male Quarren who was a prominent leader on Iego during the Clone Wars. He lived in Cliffhold. After the planet was sealed off by a Separatist laser field situated in its moons, Noloff began to despair, believing that it was caused by the \"curse of Drol\". He believed that fighting against the \"curse\" was pointless. When Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Iego, he told them that they can't leave Iego due to the curse and showed them a hologram of Taquito's death. However, they attempted to leave anyway and discovered that \"Drol\" was actually laser emitters left by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However. Noloff stood by with his belief, and when the laser emitters were destroyed, he looked awestruck although everyone else was cheering joyfully.",
