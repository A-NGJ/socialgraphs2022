 "content": "Guerno was a Human female who served as an officer in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War. In 137 ABY, the shipping vessel that she and her captain, Piard, were stationed on was raided in the Arkanis sector by Black Sun pirates, who demanded their shipment of Thunderbolt Mark 7 blasters. Guerno and Piard were rescued by the former Jedi Cade Skywalker, who used a mind trick to convince them that Black Sun pirates stole the cargo. Skywalker and his companions then took the shipment of blasters.\nGuerno, a Human female, served as an officer in Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in 137 ABY, during the Second Imperial Civil War between Krayt's Empire and deposed Emperor Roan Fel's Empire-in-exile. She served under Captain Piard aboard an Imperial shipping vessel that was delivering a cargo of Thunderbolt Mark 7 blasters via the Triellus Trade Route.\nPiard's ship stopped at the 5709-DC Shipping Lane, a hyperspace route in the Arkanis sector, and was boarded by pirates affiliated with the Black Sun crime syndicate. Guerno and Piard were threatened by the pirates' Cathar captain, Dovrin, who demanded to know where the blasters were. The Cathar was interrupted when he heard a noise nearby, and he sent his cronies to investigate. Shortly thereafter, the former Jedi Cade Skywalker and his companions, Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue, revealed themselves after boarding and rescued Guerno and Piard by killing Dovrin and neutralizing the remaining pirates.\nAs Piard thanked Skywalker, Guerno reminded him that the Jedi were enemies of the Empire, but the Captain insisted that Skywalker was not a threat. Guerno was given binders by Skywalker to detain the disabled pirates. Guerno and Piard were influenced by a mind trick from Skywalker to believe that the Black Sun pirates took their cargo and to forget the encounter. Skywalker and his companions then took the cargo.\nGuerno was dark-skinned with black hair and brown eyes. She wore the uniform of an Imperial officer. She objected when Piard showed thankfulness to Skywalker, but did not press the issue when Piard insisted that Skywalker and his companions were friends. Guerno was susceptible to the influence of Skywalker's mind trick.\nGuerno appeared in the thirty-seventh issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy, written by John Ostrander and released on June 24, 2009. She was penciled by Jan Duursema.",
