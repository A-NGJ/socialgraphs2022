 "content": "Ashla was a female Togruta Jedi youngling who trained in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in the waning years of the Jedi Order.\nAshla was a Jedi youngling during the waning years of the Jedi Order. Along with many of her fellow younglings, she received instruction from Jedi Master Yoda. During a session on lightsaber instruction, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi visited Ashla's class to talk with Yoda about the planet Kamino, a planet he was investigating that was missing from the Jedi Archives. One of Ashla's peers correctly guessed that someone had erased the files, explaining Kamino's absence. Kenobi later tracked Kamino down and found that a clone army had been created for the Galactic Republic, which the Jedi ultimately led during the ensuing Clone Wars. Ashla shared her name with another term for the light side of the Force.\nAshla appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Her name was first given August 2004 in The Official Star Wars Fact File 138, and it was later canonized by September 2015 in the official StarWars.com Databank.\nLeland Chee of Lucasfilm, addressing fan speculation, confirmed in February 2008 that Ashla and Ahsoka Tano of Star Wars: The Clone Wars were not the same character because their ages did not match up. Dave Filoni revealed they had considered making the character Ahsoka, but decided otherwise because it would have made her too young.",
