 "content": "Corporal Koyo was a Human male commando who served in the Second Platoon, B Company of the Imperial Army Special Ops Ghost Battalion during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 BBY, he participated in the Subjugation of Sulon and his team under First Lieutenant Brazack stormed into the Katarn homestead with orders to capture Morgan Katarn. It was Koyo who kicked the door open and then with Santo opened the doors to the workshop, triggering a defensive reaction of the home droid WeeGee.\nAs at that time their target was out, Morgan witnessed the intrusion safely from afar. The team returned to their base empty-handed.",
