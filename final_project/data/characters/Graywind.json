 "content": "Graywind was a gualama owned by a male maestro during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nGraywind was a creature in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nAlthough Graywind was identified as a gualama in the quest dialogue, the creature actually spawned under the generic \"farmer\" template, resulting in the so-called gualama's appearance being randomized under one of 120 possible humanoid depictions. Species Graywind could appear as included Aqualish, Bothans, Bith, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak of either gender, and Devaronians, Ishi Tib, Nikto, and Sullustans of the male gender. This article assumes that these randomized humanoid depictions are erroneous, and that Graywind is canonically a gualama in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
