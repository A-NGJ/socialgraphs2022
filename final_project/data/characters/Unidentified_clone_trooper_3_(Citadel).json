 "content": "A clone trooper participated in a mission to rescue Jedi Master Even Piell.\nAround 21 BBY, Jedi Master Even Piell was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the clone trooper was part of the rescue team sent to recover him and his officers from the Citadel, the Separatist prison where Piell was being held. The team eventually succeeded in infiltrating the facility and rescuing Master Piell and his naval officers including their captain, Wilhuff Tarkin.\nAfter freeing the Republic personnel, the Jedi split into two groups to create a diversion. The clone went with Obi-Wan Kenobi's team to create a diversion for Anakin Skywalker's team to escape. However, they were later captured and brought to Citadel Command where the warden, Osi Sobeck asked for the Nexus Route, a hyperspace route that was valuable to both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy, and the reason why Piell was captured in the first place. When Piell refused to tell, Sobeck grabbed a blaster from a nearby BX-series droid commando and prepared to execute this clone, but he was interrupted by an update on the location of Skywalker's team. Sobeck ordered his security droids to escort the prisoner to the interrogation room, but Kenobi's team was rescued by R2-D2's battle droid squadron.\nAfter being rescued, this trooper along with the team retreated to the caverns to wait for reinforcements, but they were soon ambushed by multiple droid commandos. The trooper helped an unarmored clone onto his back and was carrying him down the cliff when a BX-series droid commando shot his cable line, causing both clones to fall to their deaths.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett this clone stood at 1.83 Imperial standard meters.\nThis trooper utilized white Phase I clone trooper armor and a standard DC-15A blaster rifle.\nIn the episodes, the clone was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series.",
