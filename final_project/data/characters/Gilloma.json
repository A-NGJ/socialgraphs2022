 "content": "Gilloma was a male Ithorian junior scientist who worked at the Forard research station.\nHe previously worked for the University of Alderaan, his alma mater, for more than twelve years until he grew fed up with students he considered too slow. Fascinated by the kaluthin, he came to the research station as a junior researcher. He was satisfied with his position, not putting himself forward for prominent positions. His work concerned trying to crossbreed the kaluthin with plants from other worlds.\nGilloma stood over two meters tall, but was rather plain looking, and dressed plainly as well. He was quiet, with his zeal saved for his research, hoping that the kaluthin would revolutionarize plant use in the galaxy.",
