 "content": "Disch'l was a Force-sensitive Ithorian male and a member of the Believers during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Disch'l became involved in a Believer plot to release a virus into the atmosphere of the planet Caarimon, to kill the planet's indigenous species, the Caarites. Along with the Believers Crymsin Ost and Eph; and the assassin Melo Centris, Disch'l infiltrated the space station Creautaa-V, that was orbiting the planet. They released the virus, killing all the Caarites aboard it. They then planned to send the virus to down to the planet in escape pods. However, the Heroes of Cularin learned of the plot and confronted Disch'l and his comrades aboard the station. In the resulting fight, Disch'l created a number of Force illusions of Crymsin Ost to confuse the heroes. However, the heroes were eventually victorious and Disch'l and the other Believers were prevented from sending the virus to the planet.",
