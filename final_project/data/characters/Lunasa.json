The body armor she wore appeared to be Mandalorian in origin.\nLunasa was one of the group of bounty hunters assembled by Magus to hunt down a young boy named Talesan Fry, who had discovered their plans for the assassination of twenty galactic leaders at a conference on Rondai-2. She was able to infiltrate the Ulta Center by disguising herself. The bounty hunters found themselves pursued by a group of Jedi Knights. After confronting the Jedi, she was forced to surrender and was taken into custody.",
