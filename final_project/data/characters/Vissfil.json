 "content": "Vissfil was a male Brolf who worked for the resistance leader codenamed Patriot in 27 BBY. Patriot was in turn working for Kinman Doriana codenamed 'Defender' who was building a missile that he said was to assassinate Passel Argente. Vissfil and his brother captured Lorana Jinzler while she was following Jhompfi who had been seen accepting two burst thrusters from Duefgrin who had stolen them for him. On their way to deliver her to Patriot and Defender they knocked her out with a strong sedative. Later Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker showed up to rescue her. Vissil and his brother were turned over to the city police when they were found guarding Lorana.",
