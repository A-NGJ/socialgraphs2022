 "content": "Manuel \"Manny\" Both-Hanz was an agent of the Rebel Alliance, a very short Human or near-Human. He appears to have been involved in a romantic relationship with Mon Mothma, the Alliance Chief of State.\nIn 4 ABY, it was Manny who discovered the existence of the second Death Star; he was also able to pinpoint the exact location of the Emperor's new battlestation in the Endor system, and learned that the Emperor himself would be personally overseeing the final stages of the construction.\nTo communicate this information to the Alliance High Command, he made a rendezvous with Tag Greenley and Bink Otauna on Tatooine. Tragically, he was shot by Boba Fett in an altercation in Mos Eisley spaceport, but Tag and Bink successfully passed on the information to Mon Mothma, enabling the Rebellion to destroy the Empire.\nWhile on shuttle Tydirium, Tag and Bink reported to Mothma who requested them to present Both-Hanz to the Imperial High Command, so that the Empire wouldn't suspect that the transaction was succeeded. Dressed as Royal Guards, they delivered his body to the Death Star.\nLater during the briefing before the Battle of Endor, Mothma recounted with grief in her voice that \"Manny Both-Hanz died in the process\" of bringing the information to them.\nManuel Both-Hanz appears only in Kevin Rubio's parody comic book The Return of Tag \u0026 Bink: Special Edition; his name is a pun on the line \"Many Bothans died\" in Mon Mothma's dialogue in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The appearance of Manuel Both-Hanz is based on the American filmmaker Robert Meyer Burnett.",
