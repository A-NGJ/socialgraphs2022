 "content": "\"Heater\" was the nickname of a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic that was active during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance. Heater initially deserted the Republic Army, only to be captured and given a chance of redemption by leading an assault on a Separatist weapons depot with a new squad composed of other deserters under his leadership. After the attack was successful, Heater was given new phase I clone trooper armor and was reassigned to the famed 501st Legion, where participated alongside with in the siege of Hisseen where he was wounded.\n\"Heater\" was a clone trooper who served the Galactic Republic. At one point prior to the siege of Hisseen, Heater deserted from the Grand Army of the Republic. Eventually, Heater was placed back in Republic custody with several other deserters on the planet Kamino and, despite their actions, were allowed to dine with other clones in a mess hall. Heater and the others were confronted by the clone \"Slim,\" who believed that the deserters were cowards and that they shouldn't be allowed to dine with the others. After Slim called them cowards, Heater got into a scuffle with him until it was broken up by Clone Commander CC-3636 \"Wolffe\" who desired to speak with Heater.\nAfter discussing with Commander Wolffe why he deserted the Republic, Wolffe asked if he would participate in a mission, which would redeem him and clear his name. Heater enthusiastically agreed and began to prepare for his mission, and acquired his armor and gear.\nAfter the formation of the squad of deserters, Heater became its commanding officer and travelled with them on an LAAT/i gunship on an astronomical object. There, Heater briefed his fellow squad mates about the mission and their objective, the others spoke about their reasons for deserting and their opinions on the mission. During the conversation, the gunship was struck by a surface-to-air missile and crashed in an abandoned sector of a city.\nSome time later, Heater was part of the 501st Legion under Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and participated in the attack on Hisseen in 22 BBY. In danger of being overrun, trooper \"Twitch\" suggested that the legion retreat, which offended Heater. Heater confronted Twitch and told him the story of when he deserted the army.\nAs a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Heater was a male human who had tan skin, dark eyes, and stood at 1.83 meters tall. Heater's face had significant scarring, and he also personalized his hair by dyeing it a shade of blond and sporting a mohawk hair style. Heater's left eye was blind and appeared a shade of green.\nAfter deserting, Heater was not sure why he left the Republic, only that something came over him and that despite knowing that he was created to serve in the Clone Wars, a part of him could not stop wondering what he would do if he had a choice. Heater was hostile when being called a coward following his desertion, enough so that he physically confronted others. Although he deserted, Heater sought redemption for his betrayal against his clone brothers. When in combat, Heater was also hostile when his comrade suggested that they retreat, an act he believed was the same as betrayal.\nAs a clone trooper of the Galactic Republic, Heater was trained in combat and related subjects from a young age.\nAt one point, Heater was equipped with standard Phase I clone trooper armor, a blaster rifle, and a cape. Heater's helmet had a crack on the front that was stitched together. As a member of the 501st Legion, Heater sported a different set of Phase I armor, and bore the 501st's blue markings, along with a blue Republic crest on both sides of his helmet towards the front. When Heater was stationed on Kamino after he deserted, he used a gray uniform, as opposed to the standard red uniform worn by clone cadets and troopers that were not in service.\nHeater appeared in the fourth issue of Star Wars Adventures: The Clone Wars â€“ Battle Tales, that was released on August 26, 2020. Michael Moreci revealed an image of Heater on his Twitter account.",
