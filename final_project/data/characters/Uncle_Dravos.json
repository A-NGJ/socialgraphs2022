 "content": "Uncle Dravos was a Bothan criminal who managed the criminal empire of Maxeena Sov'lya. He was a distant relative of her and acted as a buffer between Sov'lya and her criminal enterprises. He spent most of his time at the Tal'cara spaceport making payoffs and brokering deals. While generally thought of as small-time, insiders knew he was highly thought of by Sov'lya.",
