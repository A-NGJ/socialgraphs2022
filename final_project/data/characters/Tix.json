 "content": "Tix was an Imperial Communications Officer during the Galactic Civil War. He later defected to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nA male individual, Tix served as a communications officer aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Liquidator, which held station in the Delrakkin system around the time of the Battle of Yavin. The Liquidator was the command ship of Admiral Termo, who in 0 ABY was expecting a transmission from Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who on last report had taken the Death Star battlestation to the Yavin system in order to destroy the Alliance to Restore the Republic base on the fourth moon of Yavin Prime.\nWhile awaiting contact from Tarkin, Tix was approached by Termo personally, who asked the communications officer to verify the frequency of the hyperspace transponder, to ensure that they had not missed Tarkin's message. Tix confirmed that there was no technical discrepancy, and offered to attempt to open communications with the Death Star, but Termo had received strict instructions to do nothing until they heard from Tarkin. Trying to find some other explanation, Termo quizzed Tix as to whether storms on the planet Delrakkin could be disrupting communicationsâ€”the communications officer denied that there would be any such disturbance, given their distance from the planet surface. Tix watched on with curiosity as Termo began to doubt himself, before ordering Captain Skeezer to the Liquidator's forward launch bay.\nTix was terrified of his commanding officer, Admiral Termo, to such a degree that he feared meeting the admiral's gaze. Tix had served under Termo long enough to understand that the admiral's calm tone could disguise his displeasure.",
