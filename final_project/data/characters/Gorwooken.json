 "content": "Gorwooken was a male Wookiee who operated the elevator that allowed for easy transport between the tree cities and the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, during the time of the Jedi Civil War. He was from the village of Rwookrrorro. He was one of the many lives who crossed paths with that of Revan following the memory wipe of the fomer Sith Lord. He was killed when he attempted to stop Revan for letting the Wookiee Freyyr live.\nIn Knights of the Old Republic, if the player decides to have Revan kill Freyyr, Gorwooken will not attack them and instead give them a personal escort to Chuundar himself due to have heard from his spies that Freyyr has been killed.",
