 "content": "Elias Halbert was an alcoholic Corellian smuggler who worked for Abdi-Badawzi.\nIn his youth, he was a reputable freighter pilot, but he fell victim to gambling and alcoholism and had to take up a smuggling career to pay off his many debts. He was known for losing crew members, valuable cargo, and even entire ships.\nHe employed the mischievous but technically skilled Jawa Squig as his very unreliable mechanic. He was known to pilot the Seldom Different for Abdi-Badawzi.",
