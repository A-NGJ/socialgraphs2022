 "content": "Thal K'sar was a Bith who worked for the Commerce Guild.\nAs of 33 BBY, he was an artisan, and helped design the hyperwave transceiver and holoprojector of Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray's mechno-chair.\nBy the time the Clone Wars began, he had been promoted to an executive and was stationed on Escarte.\nIn 19 BBY, he was arrested and sentenced to death, supposedly for making an accounting error that would cost the Guild a fortune; in reality, Darth Sidious was attempting to cover up those who could link the captured mechno-chair to himself. However, Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were able to rescue him. K'sar told the Jedi Knights about his other mechno-chair, which was placed aboard an experimental craft. The Jedi demanded information, so he told them where to find the pilot hired to fly the craft: on the planet Naos III.",
