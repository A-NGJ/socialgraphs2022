 "content": "A Human Mandalorian female worked as a bartender at a cantina in the small town of Enceri on the Outer Rim world of Mandalore. An elderly woman by the time of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems, the bartender was lean and gaunt, and spoke both Basic and the Mandalorian language of Mando'a.\nIn the year 20 BBY, the bartender waited on the former clone commando-tured-Mandalorian Fi Skirata. Though initially suspicious of Skirata as a stranger to Enceri who didn't speak Mando'a as the town's residents predominantly did, upon seeing the mir'shupur sigil on the young man's helmet that indicated he had suffered a brain injury, the elderly bartender softened and kindly took his order for two bowls of soup and two mugs of ale for himself and his girlfriend, Parja Bralor. Skirata mentally likened the woman's gaunt face to someone who made a habit of sucking the juice from sourcane for fun; nevertheless, he courteously paid for his order, and the female bartender delivered it to the table Skirata had taken with Bralor.\nThe unnamed bartender at the Enceri cantina first appeared in Star Wars canon in the Republic Commando novel Order 66, written by author Karen Traviss and published September 16, 2008.",
