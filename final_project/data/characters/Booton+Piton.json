 "content": "Booton Piton was a short, light-skinned, female Human who lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. In the year 22 BBY, she accompanied the Rodian Nardi Shodu on an errand to the Outlander Club on the planet Coruscant. The pair entered the club just before the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, who were there tracking the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Piton wore a form-fitting white hunter's cap and green clothing while at the club.\nBooton Piton first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones in 2004. In the film Piton was played by an uncredited extra, who was paired with the masked extra playing Shodu to help guide the other actor around. Piton's name was revealed in the 2004 article \"Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night\" which was written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 75.",
