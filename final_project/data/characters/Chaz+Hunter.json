 "content": "Chaz Hunter was a Human male from Kabaira. Chaz and his father, Del Hunter, joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic early in the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 2 BBY, the Rebel cell in Eponte was betrayed from inside. Six Rebels were killed by the stormtroopers, Del was injured but escaped and Chaz was captured with another Rebel, Blaide, and an Imperial deserter, Matt Turhaya.\nThey were later freed by Chaz's fellow rebel, Midget, and Matt's ship captain, Tere Metallo, who infiltrated the prison. During the escape, Blaide reveled himself as the traitor and tried to kill them but he was shot down by Metallo. They managed to reach the spaceport where Hunter was waiting for them. The two spacers took the Rebels in Metallo's ship, the Star Quest, to leave the planet. In orbit, the ship was attacked by three Z-95 Headhunters but they managed to escape.\nHe later joined the New Republic's Blue Squadron as Blue Four, flying as Alex Winger's wingman before her capture by the Star Destroyer Judicator.",
