 "content": "Grease was a male Wookiee who served the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. From an early age, Grease developed a talent for hacking into computers, and it was a long time before he learned that this practice was regarded by the authorities as \"slicing\" and was considered by them to be an offense. After the Galactic Empire began to round up Wookiees for use as slave labor, Grease fled and made his was to a Rebel Alliance outpost and he offered his services to the Alliance. Grease subsequently spent much of his time traveling between Rebel bases, where he researched information and refined computer programs. At some point after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, Grease and a team of Rebel agents were dispatched by the Alliance to the planet Tazan, to destroy an Imperial Data Processing Facility that was located on the world. After arriving on Tazan, Grease and the rest of the team rendezvoused with the Alliance sympathizer Willer Clines in Clines' house, in the Desander Section of Tazan City. However, their conversation with Clines was secretly monitored by a group of Imperial stormtroopers and once the stormtroopers believed that Rebels had revealed all that they would about their mission, the stormtroopers entered Clines' lounge and attacked Grease and the rest of the Rebels. The agents escaped and eventually infiltrated the Data Processing Facility, where they extracted some Imperial TIE Fighter communications protocols and then blew up the structure.",
