 "content": "Justyn Ma'Ning was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Republic Classic era. Ma'Ning was middle-aged, balding, and had a deep voice; he was most noted for taking part in the Outbound Flight Project. Under the command of Master Jorus C'baoth, whom he often clashed with, he was charged to oversee the Jedi aboard Dreadnaught-Four. During his participation on Outbound Flight, Master Ma'Ning was killed by the starfighters sent by order of Chiss Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Justyn Ma'Ning was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Achieving the rank of Jedi Master, Jedi Ma'Ning would be one of five Masters selected to accompany Master Jorus C'baoth aboard Outbound Flight as part of the Outbound Flight Projectâ€”one that would see a large group of Jedi and colonists travel aboard a massive colony ship to the edge of the galaxy and beyond, cataloging new discoveries and hopefully locating the lost Jedi Vergere.\nPlaced in command of Dreadnaught-Four, Master Ma'Ning outwardly supported the commands of the lord-like Master C'baoth, all the while questioning the need for the Jedi to cultivate more power for themselves over the non-Jedi colonists aboard the flight. Master Ma'Ning grew increasingly concerned for Master C'baoth when the obsessive man began to separate families based on their connection to the Force. Even so, with the numbers of Jedi peacekeeping forces spread critically thin in the perilous times in which they lived, Master Ma'Ning agreed that the Jedi needed to sustain and bolster their numbers by training new recruits. Ma'Ning only voiced his concerns to Jedi Knight Lorana Jinzler, who agreed to speak with her master about Ma'Ning's concerns, but the Master eventually confronted C'baoth himself. Accusing C'baoth of becoming more of a ruler than a sage, Master Ma'Ning's accusations were met with incredulous disdain. As a result, Ma'Ning ordered the convening of a Judgment Circle against C'baoth, to take place just as soon as an imminent threat had been dealt with.\nFor as Ma'Ning moved to remove C'baoth from command, Outbound Flight was attacked by a Chiss task force under the command of Force Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo . Unable therefore to convene the Judgment Circle, the Jedi rushed to their battle stations. But they were severely overwhelmed by the precision of the Chiss. During the initial attack, Master Ma'Ning was caught in an explosion and buried beneath the molten bulkhead. As he lay dying, Ma'Ning summoned Jedi Knight Jinzler to his side and warned her that C'baoth had fallen to the dark side of the Force. Encouraging Jinzler to take as many passengers as she could muster to the massive ship's central core, he predicted that they would have the best chance of survival there. With his last breath, Master Ma'Ning reminded Jinzler of her duty as a Jedi to serve others, before he succumbed to his injuries and became one with the Force.",
