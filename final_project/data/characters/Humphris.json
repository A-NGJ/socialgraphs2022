 "content": "Humphris was a Human male pilot of the First Order who was assigned to Commander Wanten's fortress on Vodran during the Cold War. When the Resistance's J-Squadron's shuttle took off, his was one of the three sentinel shuttles to intercept. Humphris chased them to the ghost moon Kufs, and brought back evidence that they had been killed. When reporting back, Wanten quickly forgot his name.\nHumphris first appeared in the 2017 young adult novel Join the Resistance: Escape from Vodran, written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker.",
