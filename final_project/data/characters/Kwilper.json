 "content": "Kwilper was a Squib trader. He left Skor II in search of the junk heap of the ancients. In the process, he discovered a talent: he could collect cast-off junk  and refashioned it into art. He earned a respectable profit due to the essentially non-existent overhead with regard to his art supplies. His personality was fairly normal for his species: overconfident, inquisitive, and annoying to others.\nKwilper carried a datapad, a multi-pocket toolbelt, and a blaster with several non-functioning modifications. He flew a Squib scout ship armed with a single tractor beam.\nKwilper is a sample character in the book Heroes \u0026 Rogues, a book of different character archetypes for use in Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game from West End Games. He is a worked example of the \"Squib Trader\" template presented in the book. Heroes \u0026 Rogues misspells his homeworld as Skorr II.",
