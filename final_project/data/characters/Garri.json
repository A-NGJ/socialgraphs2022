 "content": "Garri was a male Toydarian who lived in Pau City on the planet Utapau during the Clone Wars. There, he operated an office building within the city where he was paid to allow a Separatist-backed arms deal to take place. The deal ended with the death of Jedi Master Tu-Anh, and several days later the Jedi Order sent Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to investigate. During the investigation they searched the site of the arms deal and then interrogated Garri, with Skywalker threatening him with a lightsaber for the truth.\nA male Toydarian, Garri lived on the planet Utapau during the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic. In Pau City, Utapau's capital, he operated an office building. During the war, a Separatist IG-100 MagnaGuard paid Garri 20 druggats to leave the doors to the office building unlocked and ask no questions. The Toydarian complied, and the building was used by two MagnaGuards, an Amani, and a Sugi arms dealer to negotiate a deal for a massive kyber crystal. Jedi Master Tu-Anh, who was also on the planet at the time, caught wind of the meeting and went to investigate, watching from a distance. She was spotted, and shot by one of the MagnaGuards with a precision laser dart, which killed her.\nTwo or three days later, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker were dispatched to Utapau to investigate Master Tu-Anh's death. After examining Tu-Anh's place of death, they noticed a small hole in window of Garri's building, which had been left by the laser dart. The two Jedi set about investigating the building while accompanied by Garri, who told them he did not know who was in the offices at the time Tu-Anh had been shot. When Kenobi questioned Garri again, the Toydarian continued to claim ignorance but accidentally let slip that there had been a meeting taking place. Angered, Skywalker grabbed his lightsaber and held it to the Toydarian's throat, prompting him to recount his transaction with the droid. Garri was then brought to the Pau City Police Station while the Jedi continued their investigation. Governor Torul Blom learned of the Jedi's treatment of Garri and later listed it as one of the reasons he wanted the pair to leave the planet.\nWhen questioned by the Jedi Garri unsuccessfully attempted to conceal what he knew until threatened, at which point he swore on his grandmother Venta's life that he was telling the truth.\nGarri was created for \"A Death on Utapau,\" an episode in the canceled sixth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars which was released as an unfinished story reel on StarWars.com in 2014 as part of The Clone Wars Legacy. In the episode the Toydarian was voiced by Stephen Stanton.",
