 "content": "Shen was a human male pilot who served in the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron following the Battle of Endor. Having crashed or been shot down numerous times, Shen was forced to have extensive cybernetics to survive, but was still determined to serve the Empire. Shen once lost two vertebrae when he was shot down in an encounter with Anvil Squadron. He has broken his neck five or six times, not knowing the exact number. When Titan Squadron was planning to strike the New Republic's Starhawk and Anvil Squadron, he told Titan Three that it might ease some pain to see Anvil burn.",
