 "content": "Dobi was Human female sergeant who served as a Pop-Dog, a soldier loyal to corrupt Galactic Alliance General Stavin Thaal by 44 ABY on Vandor-3. She and her partner, Corporal Vitkins, were called in to a small dwelling to investigate the reports of domestic disturbance. They soon found themselves caught in a trap by the Quad-Linked Militant Pacifists, a fictitious terrorist organization that served as a front for Wraith Squadron. Dobi and Vitkins were both tied up after they fell for the trap, though they were later discovered by later parties of Pop-Dogs who freed them.",
