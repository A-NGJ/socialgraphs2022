 "content": "Tourath was the Padawan of Jedi Master Mara. When Mara was killed by droids on the planet M4-78, Tourath butchered the Sith troopers on the planet. When Meetra Surik arrived on the planet, Tourath attempted to kill her, thinking she was the Sith Lord responsible for Mara's death. Tourath was defeated after the attempt on Surik's life.\nTourath was one of the original characters on the planet M4-78 before it was cut from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords.\nMara and Tourath may have been early versions of Lonna Vash and Kaah Ohtok, respectively. Tourath, in addition, seemed to not be present at Mara's death. Otherwise she would have known it was droids who killed her.",
