 "content": "Vurrha Jantsk was a Zabrak male who served as the leader of the Jantsk Mercenaries, a mercenary group based on the planet Endor.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Emperor Palpatine sent an unidentified Imperial spacer on Endor to work with Jantsk in a plot to discredit the Rebel Alliance in the eyes of the monarch of Naboo, Queen Kylantha. The Queen had proven her loyalty many times over to Palpatine, but he eventually came to suspect that her sympathies actually lay with the Rebellion.\nJantsk and his men's mission was to go to the Mid Rim world and attack Queen Kylantha's chambers. Thanks to a falsified datadisk, the attack would then be attributed to the Rebels. On the Emperor's instructions, it was imperative that none of Jantsk's men knew that the Empire was hiring them. When his usefulness came to an end, Jantsk was killed by the Imperial spacer on Palpatine's orders. This way, any connection to the Empire disappeared with Jantsk.\nVurrha Jantsk was a Non-Player Character  in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
