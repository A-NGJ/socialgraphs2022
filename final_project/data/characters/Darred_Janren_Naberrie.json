 "content": "Darred Janren Naberrie was a Human male architect from the planet of Naboo. He was the husband of Sola Naberrie, and the father of Ryoo and Pooja.\nWhile attending a university, Janren met Sola Naberrie, and the two wed after graduation. Darred agreed with Sola that they should keep Naberrie as their family name because of the power and respect the name held among the citizens of Theed. The family soon grew with the birth of their daughter Ryoo in 28 BBY. Their second daughter, Pooja, who was named after Janren's maternal grandmother, would go on to become the Senator of the Chommell sector.",
