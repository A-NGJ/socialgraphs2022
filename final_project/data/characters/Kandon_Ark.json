 "content": "Kandon Ark was a green-skinned male Twi'lek who lived on Taris during the Jedi Civil War. During the Bekâ€“Vulkar gang war, he ran the swoop bike garage within the Black Vulkar Base.\nArk was one of Brejik's chief lieutenants and was in charge of the Black Vulkars garage, where he was tasked with guarding the prototype accelerator stolen from the Hidden Beks. As one of the most important Vulkars in the swoop gang, Ark had many assistants and a bodyguard. Revan, who had been hired by the Hidden Beks to recover the accelerator, was forced to kill Ark after turning down Ark's offer to kill Gadon Thek in exchange for Jedi Bastila Shan. After that, he collected the accelerator, and brought it to the Beks.\nIf the player follows the dark-side option in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Revan does not kill Ark, but instead accepts his proposal of joining the Black Vulkars' garage and killing Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks. Then Ark promotes Revan as a swoop rider for the Vulkars. If the player returns to the Black Vulkar Base, he will not be present, but his bodyguard and the other members of the gang will be there and attack the player for killing Brejik.",
