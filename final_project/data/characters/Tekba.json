 "content": "Captain Tekba was a Mon Calamari male who commanded the New Republic troopship Pelagia during the Galactic Civil War. In 11 ABY, while the Pelagia was en route to reinforce a New Republic siege of an Imperial shipyard on the Galactic Rim, it stopped to pick up an X-wing fighter flight group in the Ottega system. At that moment, a particle disintegrator warhead was fired at Tekba's starship from the Galaxy Gun, Emperor Palpatine's newest superweapon.\nAlthough General Lando Calrissian warned Tekba of the missile, which was approaching his position through hyperspace, Tekba did not have enough time to retreat and instead attempted to intercept and destroy the warhead. However, his effort failed, and the missile destroyed the Pelagia, killing Tekba and a hundred thousand of the New Republic's best troops that it had been carrying aboard.\nTekba was a Mon Calamari male who served in the New Republic's naval forces during the later stages of the Galactic Civil War. By the year 11 ABY, Tekba had attained the rank of captain and was in command of the troopship Pelagia. During that time, the New Republic was caving in under the onslaught of the reborn Galactic Emperor Palpatine, who used his newest superweapon, the Galaxy Gun, to spread a reign of terror across the galaxy.\nThe Galaxy Gun was capable of firing particle disintegrator warheads that traveled through hyperspace and could destroy entire celestial bodies, as was the case with the moon of Da Soocha V, where the New Republic had operated its Pinnacle Base, as well as two other targets.\nSometime after the destruction of Pinnacle Base, Tekba and the Pelagia were assigned to reinforce a New Republic siege of an Imperial shipyard that was taking place on the Galactic Rim. Loaded to its brink with a hundred thousand of the New Republic's finest ground troops and heavy armor, the Pelagia embarked on a journey toward the shipyard.\nOn the way, however, the Pelagia made a stop in the Ottega system to rendezvous with Green Group, a flight group of T-65 X-wing starfighters. Learning of that rendezvous spot, Emperor Palpatine, stationed on his throneworld of Byss, fired the Galaxy Gun at the Pelagia. As the particle disintegrator warhead was traveling toward Tekba's ship, it was detected by New Republic long-range sensors.\nWhile the X-wings of Green Group were still in the process of docking with the Pelagia, Tekba was contacted by General Lando Calrissian of the New Republic High Command. Calrissian warned Tekba of the approaching missile, informing the Mon Calamari of its destructive capabilities and surmising that the Pelagia only had ten minutes to escape. However, Tekba realized that he would be unable to bring his ship to safety in time, as the Pelagia would require at least thirty minutes to reach lightspeed. As such, Tekba began preparing the forces under his command to take a stand against the warhead.\nAs the missile emerged from hyperspace, Tekba contacted the X-wings of Green Group that were still in space near the Pelagia, asking them to provide assistance. Tekba launched the Pelagia's own starfighter complement and sounded a full battle alarm, bringing all of the troopship's defense cannons to fire at the warhead. Yet even the combined firepower of the Pelagia and the X-wings was not enough to penetrate the warhead's deflector shields. Tekba was soon notified of the futility of their attack by Green Leader in charge of Green Group. As the missile approached the Pelagia, Tekba desperately attempted to perform evasive maneuvers, but it was to no avail. The warhead exploded on impact with the troopship, annihilating the Pelagia and killing Tekba as well as all those aboard.\nIn the meantime, Emperor Palpatine, who was watching the attack through a live feed transmitted through subminiature probe drones that had followed the missile, was ecstatic at the destruction of the New Republic warship.\nThe Emperor demonstrated the event to the ruler of the Gama-Senn species, using the fear of the Galaxy Gun to bring the species under his rule. The news of the Pelagia's destruction and the loss of Tekba and all the troops aboard was another major blow to the New Republic, whose new base on the Space City of Nespis VIII soon became the next target of Palpatine's weapon.\nCaptain Tekba was the commanding officer of the Pelagia, a major New Republic troopship that was capable of ferrying over a hundred thousand troops. However, Tekba was not particularly impressed with his command, referring to the vessel as an \"old hunk.\"\nOrdered by his superiors to reinforce the siege of an Imperial shipyard, the Mon Calamari was intent on completing that mission and was later hesitant to abort docking procedures with the X-wings of Green Group, even after he was informed of the incoming Galaxy Gun attack. When faced with the prospect of destruction by the Galaxy Gun, Tekba hastily attempted to organize a defense, giving frantic orders to the crew of the Pelagia, but he was unable to stop Palpatine's superweapon. Tekba had black eyes and dark skin.\nAt the time of his death in the Ottega system, Tekba wore a uniform jerkin, with a sidearm secured inside a holster at his belt.\nTekba first appeared in the 1995 Dark Horse comic book Empire's End 1, written by Tom Veitch and illustrated by Jim Baikie. He later appeared in the audio drama adaptation of the comic book, which presented a minor inconsistency, as Tekba was contacted by Chief of State Mon Mothma, instead of Lando Calrissian, who performed the task in the comic.\nThe Essential Atlas, published in 2009, placed the destruction of the Pelagia on the Braxant Run hyperlane in the Outer Rim Territories, while placing the Ottega system, where the attack occurs in the original comic, in the Mid Rim.",
