 "content": "Zeth Bresque was a Balosar female slave. She was also an addict to death sticks.\nIn around 20 BBY, Bresque had been captured by slaver Phylus Mon and kept in a cell in Mon's slave zoo aboard the Animiasma. Her cell had a slot and a lever so that Bresque could get a new death stick whenever she wanted. This was apparently an experiment to see how long she could survive with a constant supply of her drugs. As a result, she was not anxious to leave.\nPhylus Mon surgically inserted an explosive near the heart of each of his slaves. The explosive would be activated in the case of Phylus Mon's death, but it could also be deactivated with the impact of an ion blaster. All the slaves in Phylus Mon's zoo were also regularly battered.",
