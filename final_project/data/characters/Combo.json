The Hutt Raskurro was about to hand over Combo to Rogun's Houk enforcer Strilth when Vaz Traniff and Voidhound arrived to rescue him. Strilth was killed, Combo released and Raskurro persuaded to sever the Hutt Cartel's ties with Rogun. Afterwards, the Voidhound, Traniff and Combo set out to raid the Imperial treasury ship King's Ransom in orbit of the Smuggler's Moon. Vaz and Combo hid in a cargo container while the smuggler captain delivered them onto the ship in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Though the King's Ransom was soon destroyed by the Voidwolf, Combo and Vaz made it out alive and with plenty of valuable plunder.",
