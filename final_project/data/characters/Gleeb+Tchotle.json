 "content": "Gleeb Tchotle was a male Ishi Tib who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nGleeb Tchotle was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Gleeb Tchotle spawned under the generic \"noble\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of forty-two possible depictions. Species Tchotle could appear as included Bothans, Humans, Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, and Zabrak under either gender. The quest dialogue identified Tchotle as a male Ishi Tib, which this article assumes to be canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
