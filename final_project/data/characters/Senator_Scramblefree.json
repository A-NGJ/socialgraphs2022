 "content": "\"Senator Scramblefree\" was the main nickname given to a male Sullustan senator by a group of angry New Republic officers during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The senator ordered Green Squadron to cover his shuttle's escape from the Battle of Coruscant, pulling the starfighter unit away from Pride of Honor, causing the crew to suffer 241 deaths and the ship to be scrapped.\nThe former captain of the Pride confronted the Sullustan and his colleague on Mon Calamari in 28 ABY. The senators were told by the angry Phindian and her unintervening onlookers to vote for an upcoming fleet appropriations bill, and that if either of them ever tried to commandeer a Fleet vessel again, the officers would pack them into an escape pod aimed for the Yuuzhan Vong.",
