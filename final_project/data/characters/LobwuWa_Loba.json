 "content": "LobwuWa Loba was an Ualaq Aqualish from the planet Tatooine and an aspiring podracer pilot in 32 BBY, when Loba attended the Boonta Eve Classic as a spectator in the Mos Espa Grand Arena. Over the next decade, Loba was able to build a reputation in the podracing world and, in 22 BBY, competed in a race held in the arena.\nIn 32 BBY, the Ualaq Aqualish LobwuWa Loba wanted to pilot podracers for a living. Hailing from Tatooine, Loba was present in that planet's Mos Espa Grand Arena to watch the Boonta Eve Classic from the personal box of the junk dealer Watto.\nThe Aqualish became a relatively established podracer over the next ten years. In 22 BBY, Loba returned to the Grand Arena as the local favorite to win a podracing competition. Loba was among the competitors that the neophyte bounty hunter Boba Fett recognized as an appreciator of the sport. The winner of the race had been predetermined by the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure.\nLoba was thuggish-looking with four black eyes, brown skin, and light blond hair. The Aqualish had the ability to pilot a podracer and enough determination to make their dream to become a professional racer a reality.\nLobwuWa Loba appeared on a viewscreen in the 2003 young reader novel Boba Fett: Hunted by Elizabeth Hand. The 2012 Rogues Gallery feature in the Star Wars Insider magazine's 131st issue, \"An Audience of Aliens,\" identified individuals in Watto's viewing box from the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and retroactively established that Loba was among them.",
