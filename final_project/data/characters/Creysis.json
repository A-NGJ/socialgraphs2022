 "content": "A male Ebruchi, Creysis was a pirate captain in charge of an scout squadron that he commanded from his Ebruchi command ship. In 2 ABY, the Ebruchi's scout squadron encountered the Galactic Empire Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Admonitor.  Creysis claimed he was the ruler of the star system, and agreed to meet the supposed leader of an Alderaanian colony, who was, unbeknownst to the pirate captain, Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, aboard the Admonitor.\nThrawn theorized that Creysis was not truly the Ebruchi leader, and presented him with a golden statue, which secretly contained a transmitter that transmitted every sound to the Grand Admiral, so that he would not flee without securing his ship's other contents. While the captain returned to his flagship, escorted by an Imperial Zeta-class shuttle and TIE fighters containing the Alderaanian \"Council of Colonists\"—consisting of Admiral Voss Parck and several stormtroopers—with the Admiral's gift, the secret transmitter allowed the Imperial forces to determine where and who was the true Ebruchi leader. Aboard the Ebruchi flagship, Thrawn's council attacked Creysis's troops and captured the vessel.",
