 "content": "Babel Torsch was the Imperial Customs office head in the Minos Cluster. He was known as a by-the-book customs official with no tolerance for the slightest infraction.\nBabel Torsch proved himself to the Empire early in his career as a bureaucrat. He then\nheld a position as an advisor to the consular general of Adarlon, but after targeting the Holo Industry and having many entertainers blacklisted, industry interests blackmailed his superiors into letting him go.\nBabel was retrained an appointed as the head of the Imperial Customs office in the Minos Cluster where he excelled at his job of uncovering hidden Rebel agents and corrupt Imperial officers.\nBabel Torsch was an egotistical, by-the-books kind of official. He would not tolerate a single infraction and was immune to bribery. Physically he was pudgy and dark-skinned.\nWhile his last name is spelled \"Torsch\" in the stat box, the describing texts repeatedly spells it \"Torsh\". In Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, Babel Torsh is the boss of ISB investigator Cha Raas who operated in the Minos cluster.",
