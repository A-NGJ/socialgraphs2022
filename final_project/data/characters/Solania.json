 "content": "Solania was a male Human who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Master during the Galactic War with the Sith Empire. A tan-skinned Human with black eyes and a black goatee, Solania wore gray robes and armor or a set of yellow-brown combat armor. Solania wielded a single lightsaber and spent much of his time on the space station Carrick Station, equipping Jedi Knights with gear.\nMaster Solania first appeared as a Rakata Gear vendor for Jedi Knights in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. However, with the reorganization of the gear system that accompanied Game Update 2.0, Solania was changed to an Elite Gear vendor, and his armor was changed to a different set of gear. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
