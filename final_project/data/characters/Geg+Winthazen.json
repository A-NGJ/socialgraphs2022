 "content": "Geg Winthazen was an Imperial major and non-com posted to the Emperor's Retreat on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War. He was later based out of the city of Narmle on Naboo's moon of Rori. Captain Thrawn once sent a spacer to deliver some holodisks taken from the black box of a downed shuttle to Winthazen.\nGeg Winthazen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nHe was originally part of the old Imperial themepark in which Thrawn sent players to locate Winthazen near the Emperor's Retreat on Naboo. However, in the updated version of the Imperial themepark, Winthazen was placed in Narmle on Rori. Despite these changes, the overall story of delivering him holodisks from a downed shuttle remained the same.",
