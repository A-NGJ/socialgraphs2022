 "content": "The female shanjaru was the last female member of shanjaru, a species that was driven nearly to extinction at the time of the Cold War. Drooga the Hutt possessed the beast and wished to obtain the last male shanjaru in order to serve them as part of his feast. Risha Drayen obtained the male shanjaru and wished to traded him to Drooga in exchange for a prototype engine. However, Momi Andrell and a group of animal rights activists working to save the shanjaru and repopulate the species stole the female from Drooga's pleasure barge and took genetic samples, sending them to Coruscant. Risha's companion Voidhound had to retrieve the female and send her back to Drooga before their deal could be finalized.\nThe female shanjaru appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Smuggler class mission on the planet Nar Shaddaa.",
