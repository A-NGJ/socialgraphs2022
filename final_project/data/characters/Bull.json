 "content": "Bull \"The Unbreakable\"  was a male Weequay mercenary who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY, Bull was hired by Jundo Martik to recover stolen ore and drive off the Twin Suns pirate gang from a mine in the Jundland Chasm on Tatooine. When Bull and his associates failed to return after a few days, a group of Republic spacers was sent by Jundo Martik to reclaim the mine. Bull and the other mercenaries attempted to frame the spacers for the theft of the ore, but were killed by the droid ST-97.\nBull \"The Unbreakable\" appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the heroic mission \"Reap the Whirlwind\" on Tatooine.",
