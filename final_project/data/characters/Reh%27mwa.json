 "content": "Reh'mwa was a Bothan radical and a leader of the True Victory Party, a group of Bothans who tried to continue the ar'krai against the Yuuzhan Vong. As of 35 ABY, he and his fellow fundamentalists had acquired a ship, the Avengeance, in a bid to locate Zonama Sekot and wipe out the Yuuzhan Vong. Their efforts were unsuccessful, with the Avengeance neutralized and most of his crew imprisoned in MaxSec Eight.\nIn 40 ABY, Reh'mwa began again threatening the Yuuzhan Vong and the Dhuryam on Coruscant. Reh'mwa, along with several other members of the True Victory Party, was later killed by Lumiya on the request of Jacen Solo after the death of the World Brain.",
