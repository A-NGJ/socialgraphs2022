 "content": "Weng Wrightsyn was a male Human citizen living on Dromund Kaas during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. He felt that justice wasn't being applied by the Security Forces and that killers ran free, so he asked a traveler to investigate.\nIn 3643 BBY, a series of murders took place in Kaas City, and he claimed to have seen the killer in the act. Calling on a passing individual to investigate the murderer, a bounty hunter named Renegin, to investigate.\nRenegin informed the individual of his job, tagging people for a Sith game, and that he was looking to escape Dromund Kaas after those he tagged started dying. Renegin convinced the individual to tag Wrightsyn to silence him.",
