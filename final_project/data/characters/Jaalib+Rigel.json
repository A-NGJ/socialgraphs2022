 "content": "Jaalib Rigel was a Human male environmentalist who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Jaalib Rigel discovered that the criminals of the Chirq Council were developing heavy weapon prototypes in the Second Elite Council Bunker, near the city of Doaba Guerfel. The man was concerned because those weapons would be very dangerous for the Corellian environment.\nIn 1 ABY, Captain Vitala Baize of the Corellian Security Force started an operation against the Chirq Council to destroy the organization and thus assaulted the First and Second Elite Council Bunkers. Jaalib Rigel encountered the CorSec agents near the Second Elite Council Bunker before their assault and requested them to deal with the weapons. An independent spacer who regularly worked for the CorSec agreed and then destroyed all the prototypes of each of the three experimental heavy weapon types. Eventually, the Chirq Council splintered after the Chirq Council elite councilors were killed by the CorSec during the attacks of the Elite Council Bunkers.\nJaalib Rigel was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jaalib Rigel was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
