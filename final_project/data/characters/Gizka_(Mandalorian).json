 "content": "Gizka was a female Mandalorian with the Dar'manda. Composed of other former Mandalorians on Mek-Sha, the Dar'manda were a group of gunrunners and mercenaries active during the third Galactic War.\nShe was the youngest member of the Dar'manda. Due to this, Gizka's armor was the most scraped together in the group.\nGizka first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught which was the seventh Digital Expansion to SWTOR. The development of her design was oversaw by Dave Shramek.",
