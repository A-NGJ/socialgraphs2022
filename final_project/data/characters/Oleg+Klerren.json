 "content": "Oleg Klerren was the male mayor of Anchorhead, a town on the planet Tatooine, during the Cold War. He had two aides named Cohn and Ixa assisting him with his duties. When Anchorhead was hit by a series of bombings that killed over a hundred of people, Oleg was glad to see Havoc Squad lieutenant arrive with help. They were contacted by a former Havoc Squad member, Vanto Bazren, who told them that Imperial Colonel Gorik was behind the bombings. Havoc Squad was able to stop Gorik and rescue Fuse, for which Oleg was extremely grateful.",
