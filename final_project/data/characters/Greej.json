 "content": "Greej was an elderly male Near-Human who was held prisoner by Starhunter's Intergalactic Menagerie, until Price Coby, Jann Tosh, and his droids set him free. After, he helped them find Ingey. He later came with Jann to the nearest planet.\nThe Starhunters had planned to sell him as an \"exotic lifeform\" to aliens living in distant parts of the galaxy. When Jann Tosh, along with R2-D2 and C-3PO entered the Academy, Greej returned all the captured creatures to their home with the help of Coby.\nGreej appeared to be Human, except he has three-fingered hands; consequently, he had been classified here as a Near-Human. He had dark blue eyes and brown hair. He wore a dark brown jump-suit with a tan vest and hat.",
