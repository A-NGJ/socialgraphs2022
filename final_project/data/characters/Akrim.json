 "content": "Akrim was a male Morling criminal, who operated as a pirate during the Galactic Civil War.\nAkrim was a clan leader of the Morling population at the pirate lair of Providence. Thus, he sat on the Council but did not take an active part in it, since people on the station usually did not take the Morling's position into account.\nAkrim was an average Morling, brutal and ferocious. He had a penchant for alcohol and was drunk most of the time.\nHe generally wore an orange pilot suit and many talismans and trophies, never leaving behind his heavy blaster and his mace.\nAkrim was created by Jean-Michel Ringuet for the ambiguously canon roleplaying aid \"Providence,\" which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 1. He was illustrated by Jean-Marc Emy.",
