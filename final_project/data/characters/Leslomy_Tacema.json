 "content": "Leslomy Tacema was a Duros female native to her species' eponymous homeworld. By 4 ABY, she became a pilot who helped run the docking facilities in Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine. While approving all cargo manifests in her line of work, Tacema was forgiving of minor transgressions.\nLeslomy Tacema, a Duros female, hailed from Duro, a planet that was also her species' homeworld. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, she was a pilot who helped run the docking facilities in Mos Eisley, a city on the planet Tatooine. Tacema was friends with Ohwun De Maal, another pilot of her species.\nIn 4 ABY, Tacema was present in the courtroom of crime lord Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine when the Jedi Luke Skywalker arrived to rescue his ally Han Solo, who was held prisoner by Jabba. Skywalker was dropped into the pit of Jabba's rancor but was ultimately able to kill the rancor. Tacema and others in the courtroom then watched Jabba sentence him, Solo, and their companion Chewbacca to be executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon.\nApproving of all cargo manifests during her role running Mos Eisley's docking facilities, Tacema was forgiving of minor transgressions. She was blue-skinned with red eyes. Her first name had an unknown meaning in her species' language of Durese, while her surname translated to \"pest control warden.\"\nTacema was an expert pilot.\nTacema wore a white jacket with a blue scarf.\nLeslomy Tacema first appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Her scene was filmed between February 3 and February 5, 1982 at Elstree Studios's stage 8. Tacema's name was coined in 1998 by a card in the Jabba's Palace Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game. According to a fan website for the game, Tacema was named as an anagram of Stacy Mollema, who was responsible for licensing at Lucasfilm Ltd.\nThe Star Wars Customizable Card Game represented Tacema with a mirrored version of an image of Ohwun De Maal instead of the Duros extra seen in Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi. However, StarWars.com gave Tacema a Databank entry that listed her as appearing in Return of the Jedi. This article thus assumes that Tacema is the Duros from the film.",
