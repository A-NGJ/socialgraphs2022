 "content": "Rodno was a male Kadrillian who served as a guide for Rebels Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa on the planet Kadril. The Rebels helped reunite Rodno with his lover, Deerna.\nAs a head of science at Kadril Dal Quirz was assisted by Rodno, her young assistant. Rodno hoped to live with Deerna, but because she heard from Nociv, she found Rodno unworthy as a partner. All hope was based on the strength of his experimental invention: the Vibro-crystal.\nRodno learned Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo and Chewbacca and after Quirz recalled that Darth Vader wanted to collect Kunda, Rodno, Han and Luke went to the Nocivs where Kunda was located.\nRodno warned the Nocivs for an attack by the stormtroopers. In this attack Mdel came to life and the elder was buried on the Hom Mounds. Deerna found Rodno still unworthy, but during a last attack by Father with the Pacifog, Rodno saved Deerna's life.\nMeanwhile, Leia, Del Quirz and Chewbacca discovered that Rodno's Vibro-crystal proved to be a great success and even protected from the Pacifog of Father. Rodno recovered from his injuries and Deerna found him a worthy partner.\nRodno appeared in the comic strip Planet of Kadril by Russ Helm and Alfredo Alcala. Helm, a drummer, based the character's name on American radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer.",
