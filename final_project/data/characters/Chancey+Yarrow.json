 "content": "Chancey Yarrow was a female human scientist, trader, and pirate who lived during the High Republic Era. An expert on theoretical hyperspace physics, Chancey was expelled from the Academy of Carida just before earning her doctorate after it was discovered she had lied about using research funds to try and build a gravity well projector. Subsequently, Chancey became a hauler for the Byne Guild, having a daughter, Sylvestri, during this time. She developed connections to pirates such as the Nihil Tempest Runner Lourna Dee, and eventually faked her death to work on the Gravity's Heart space station in the Berenge sector, hoping to achieve her dream project.\nYarrow was captured and taken to the Starlight Beacon where she was imprisoned. During the Nihil's sabotage of the station, she was freed. She realized that the station was plummeting into Eiram's atmosphere and attempted to repair the positional thrusters. The scientist was discovered by Elzar Mann, who mistook her for a Nihil saboteur and bisected her with his lightsaber.",
