 "content": "Wilk was a Radnoran who was believed to be immune to Radnor's bioplague, as he was seen in the Isolation Sector without a protective bio-isolation suit looking for his wife. Later on, it turned out that he was not immune. He had entered the Sector after the plague's half-life made it benign, making him perfectly safe from any harmful effects.",
