 "content": "A human Imperial officer served in the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the officer was present on the Star Destroyer Righteous Fist when Lieutenant Beilert Valance was aboard the Star Destroyer awaiting the debriefing for his next mission. The officer thought that Valance was cute and purchased a drink for him which they had a service droid deliver to Valance. As the droid gave the drink to Valance, it quoted the officer to Valance. After this, the officer looked over to Valance.",
