In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars, the Aqualish served on the planet Drongar and was wounded during the battle raging on the world. He was brought to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 where he was operated on by the Duros surgeon Leemoth.\nThe Aqualish had a brief appearance in MedStar II: Jedi Healer, the second novel of the MedStar Duology. Jedi Healer was written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004.",
