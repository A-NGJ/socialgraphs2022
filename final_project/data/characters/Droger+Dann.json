 "content": "Droger Dann was a male Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He had a shop in the Anchorhead market, where he sold heavy armor.\nDroger appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Heavy Armor Vendor for Republic players on Tatooine. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Droger was removed from the game along with the rest of the Heavy Armor Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games, which identified him as \"Droger Dann.\"",
