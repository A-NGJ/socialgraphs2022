 "content": "Hrym Mawarr was a male Skakoan bounty hunter and politician. In 43 ABY, he was hired by Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala to assist Captain Savar's Security forces in the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker for dereliction of duty, although the Jedi was released soon after. Mawarr was later hired by Daala to capture psychotic Jedi Knight Valin Horn during the Knight's rampage through Coruscant. Horn, however, was apprehended by Skywalker.\nHrym Mawarr was a male Skakoan who made a living as a bounty hunter as well as a politician: he was known for returning to his home system in between stretches of bounty hunting to spend years as an elected member of law enforcement. In 43.5 ABY, Mawarr, alongside fellow bounty hunters Dhidal Nyz and Zilaash Kuh, was hired by Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala for her special-missions force to assist Galactic Alliance Security troops in the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, who had failed to prevent Darth Caedus' fall to the dark side of the Force. Under the command of Security Captain Savar, Mawarr, Nyz, Kuh, and several other bounty hunters hired by Daala accompanied the Security forces during the arrest. They successfully apprehended Skywalker outside of the Senate Building on Coruscant, although the Jedi was later released.\nSoon after, Jedi Knight Valin Horn suffered a psychotic breakdown and went on a destructive rampage through Coruscant's business district. Mawarr was among the many bounty hunters again hired by Daala for her special-missions force that attempted to capture the rogue Jedi. He was unsuccessful in this hunt, however, as Skywalker incapacitated Horn, who was then placed in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center.\nDespite his career in bounty hunting—in which he had decades of experience—Mawarr was also a politician; he was elected to law enforcement positions in his home system multiple times. Due to these two occupations, Mawarr was well-known throughout the galaxy. When traveling offworld, Mawarr wore a bronze pressure suit, as Skakoans could not survive on worlds with low-pressure atmospheres. During his hunt for Horn, he flew in a large green airspeeder.\nMawarr appeared briefly in Aaron Allston's 2009 novel, Fate of the Jedi: Outcast, the first of nine novels in the Fate of the Jedi series.",
