 "content": "Codi Ty was a male Togruta Padawan who served the Jedi Order as the apprentice of Jedi Master B'dard Tone during the waning years of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive male Togruta, Codi Ty was a member of the Jedi Order, learning the ways of the Force as a Padawan.\nIn 21 BBY, after the conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted into the Clone Wars, Ty's fellow Jedi B'dard Tone took his Padawan, Zephata'ru'tor on a mission to retake Nadiem. During the mission, the two Jedi encountered Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous. Though Tone survived the encounter, Grievous severed Tone's right arm and badly disfigured the left side of his face. Zephata'ru'tor was not as fortunate—while attempting to stop Grievous from fleeing the planet, the cyborg general activated his starfighter's hyperdrive in Zephata'ru'tor's path, disintegrating him into nothing.\nAfter the battle, Tone was fitted with a metal plate that covered much of the left side of his head and face, as well as a cybernetic arm to replace the one he lost. Later, Ty was accepted as Tone's new padawan, and learned to think as his new master did.\nIn 20 BBY, Padawan, Flynn Kybo lost his Master, T'chooka D'oon at the hands of General Grievous. After this loss, he presented the High Council with the idea of hunting down and eliminating Grievous once and for all. Though this went against the Jedi Code, he believed it met with the Jedi principle of sacrificing one to save many. The Council was disturbed by his proposal, and ordered him not to follow through with it. They assigned him a new Master, Z'meer Bothu, whom Kybo soon met. She too found his idea out of line, and urged him to meditate with her instead. After hours of such meditation, Tone and Ty approached the bored Padawan and asked him about his plan.\nKybo was confused, as he had told no one of this, but Tone simply responded that it had been revealed to him in confidence. He said that he believed that Kybo's idea had much merit, though the difficulties it posed were many. Tone then revealed to Kybo his past experiences with Grievous, and suggested they meet soon to discuss it further at a cantina in Husker Square.\nSoon after, their plans in place, Kybo abandoned his Master and the Order just before the Battle of Alderaan, and met Tone and Ty on the backwater planet of Bryndar. Though the inhabitants of the sector were rumored to hate the Trade Federation, the three Jedi were at a loss on where to begin hunting for Grievous, as he could be on countless worlds across the galaxy. Not long after this, however, a man named Stellskard from the Banvhar Combine approached Kybo as he meditated and revealed that their quest for Grievous had spread rumors across Bryndar. As he and his compatriots also sought revenge on the Separatist general, Stellskard offered their help in the hunt, and brought the Jedi to Banvhar Station.\nThe miners of the station were, as Stellskard put it, a \"beaten people\", who had fought a brief and devastating war with the Trade Federation. Grievous had allowed his battle droids to use the miners as target practice, further adding to their hatred of the callous Kaleesh. Once on board the asteroid base, Stellskard introduced the Jedi to Rini, a technician who had been able to pick up a Separatist transmission. Though the group was unable to determine the precise meaning of the garbled conversation—in actuality, Grievous revealing to Count Dooku that he had captured a group of young Padawans—they believed their mission may have been uncovered. After the transmission ended, Rini was able to establish the source of the signal as originating in the Anoat system, but couldn't target it any closer.\nRini then revealed that during the miners' war with the Trade Federation, they were able to obtain some of their enemy's equipment, including a type of probe droids which Tone had encountered before. Though Tone voiced his concern that the droids may turn on them if activated, Kybo assured him that his astromech droid, CB-3D, would be able to ensure their memories had been wiped. The three droids were soon sent inside pods to the Anoat system to locate Grievous, and potentially assassinate him at the same time.\nThe droids did manage to find Grievous on the moon of Belsus, where he had perpetrated a massacre against the native Ugnaught population. The droids then attacked him, and as Kybo had predicted, they failed in this attempt, with Grievous quickly destroying all three. Ty and the other Jedi readied to depart for Belsus, with Stellskard and Rini joining them. Rini had obtained codes that should allow them to pass through the orbital blockade surrounding the moon, but he was unsure if they were recent enough. Meanwhile, Tone asked the miners of the Combine to accompany them on their mission, and each and every miner agreed. With the armed miners by their side, the Jedi boarded their ship to the Anoat system. Tone warned Kybo one final time of the repercussions of their actions and their potential excommunication from the Order, but Kybo remained determined.\nOnce there, Rini's codes did indeed manage to work, but were old enough to warrant further scrutiny. Rini then picked up another transmission about Padawans, and the Jedi once more assumed their mission had been compromised. Without their former distance to garble the transmission, Rini was able to hear that the Padawans in question were in fact ones that had been held by the general and had now escaped. Tone then decided that while their mission to kill Grievous still applied, it was more important to rescue the young Jedi from his clutches.\nSince their codes caused some suspicion among the Separatist blockade, their ship was ordered to report to customs. When they did not, and landed near where the Padawans were held captive, they caused B1-Series battle droids to surround their ship. Ty, the Jedi, and the miners responded by attacking the droids head on, making short work of them. Although the other Jedi could not, Tone was able to sense the strong presence of Allara, one of the Padawans. The miners were angry that the Jedi wished to rescue the Padawans, but Tone pointed out that not only were the Padawans children, but wherever they were, Grievous would be nearby. When an explosion blocked their way forward, the miners fell back to their ship, while the Jedi moved downward, sensing the Padawans below.\nIn the caves below the facility, the Ugnaughts had built secret tunnels and homes, and were using them to hide from Grievous' invasion. They had been able to free the Padawans, but soon after they secreted them away to the underground, Grievous found them and attacked. When Allara, one of the captive younglings, asked him for a lightsaber so that she could defend herself, Grievous was amused, and tossed her one of his. Though she fought bravely, it was mere moments before he disarmed her. As he prepared to kill the girl, Kybo jumped in front of Grievous' lightsaber, deflecting the strike with his own blade.\nTy and Tone joined Kybo, with Tone ordering Ty to take the Padawans to safety. Kybo and Tone began to duel Grievous, attempting to complete their mission to kill him. Taking up the lightsaber Grievous had given her once more, Allara told Ty she would do better than just follow him, and joined Ty in fighting the battle droids in their way. They reached a ladder and hatch, escaping from the underground, but as they ascended, Ty sensed his master's death and despaired. Allara urged him to honor Tone's final command and continue, pointing out that otherwise his sacrifice would be meaningless. Once in the facility's hangar, they found the Banvhar miners defending their ship, overwhelmed and preparing to leave. Ty and the Padawans joined the miners aboard their ship, and they quickly fled as the facility detonated around them, Kybo's duel with Grievous ending in the ignition of the building's fuel supply. Ty told the others that Grievous must have died as well.\nTy brought the rescued Padawans back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, then brought Allara before the Jedi Council. Ty reported the events on Belsus to the Council, and made it clear that although he believed Grievous to be dead and that he had rescued the Padawans, he wanted nothing for himself. Allara pleaded for leniency for Ty, but he was prepared to take his exile without regrets. Yoda told Ty he should have much to regret, and banned the young Togruta from the Order forever.",
