 "content": "In 29 ABY, three Bith prisoners at a Yuuzhan Vong facility on Selvaris went by the nickname Clak'dor in reference to their homeworld, Clak'dor VII. Many of the prisoners were referred to by such rather than their name. When Ryn one-one-five, a member of the Ryn Network, smuggled a secret message into the compound, all three Bith and the Jenet Thorsh viewed and memorized the mathematical codes displayed by the holowafer, and escaped the compound in order to bring the information to New Republic High Command. On a swoop bike, this particular Bith was killed by Yuuzhan Vong coralskipper while attempting to escape the planet.",
