 "content": "Ichor was a rancor, the daughter of herd-mother Tosh, who served the witches of the Singing Mountain Clan on Dathomir. During the Battle of Dathomir, she and her mother accompanied Luke Skywalker to destroy an outpost that was manned by one Nightsister and several Imperial walkers. The three engaged the outpost, but Ichor was bombarded by laser fire, losing an arm and then dying shortly thereafter. Her mother, Tosh, was deeply saddened by the loss of her daughter, and shortly after seeing her daughter killed by the Imperials, went on a rampage, destroying them.",
