 "content": "Tolkar was a male Barabel, who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nTolkar worked as a foreman at a warehouse on the planet Barab I. At some point, the Galactic Empire accidentally routed a shipment of sixty five blaster rifles to Barabel I and they were put into Tolkar's warehouse for storage. Although the rifles were valuable, the Empire did not know that they were on Barab I and they were taking up space in the warehouse, so Tolkar sold them to a group of freelance agents.",
