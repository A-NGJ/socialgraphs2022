 "content": "Noric Gestal was a male Gotal slaver around the time leading up to the Clone Wars. Gestal spent a great amount of time on the planet Ryloth, searching for beautiful Twi'lek females to sell to his customers. He was often at odds with Chieb'Kalla, who employed a staff of beautiful females at the Fungus Pit, where they were off-limits to slavers. Gestal's frustration boiled over into anger shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis, and he hatched a plot to steal as many of the females workers as he and his gang could. Entering a bar with twenty-three of his goons, their attempt was thwarted by a group of freelance agents who were on Ryloth in search of Jedi Master Vhiin Thorla. In the fighting that ensued, Gestal himself was killed, and the other slavers were gassed into unconsciousness. They were later arrested and sent to prison.",
