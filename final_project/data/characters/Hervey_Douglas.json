 "content": "Hervey Douglas was a Human who served the Galactic Empire as a military clerk during the Galactic Civil War.\nDouglas was based inside the Imperial Data Processing Facility on the planet Tazan and along with the clerk Mir Vladick, the Human was responsible for ensuring the orderly running of the facility's contingent of stormtroopers. Sometime after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, the child Jastina Clines was imprisoned inside the Data Processing Facilty and Douglas and Vir took pity on her, so they smuggled some toys and books into her cell, to keep her happy. A short time later, a team of Rebel Alliance agents infiltrated the base and encountered Douglas and Vir, and the two clerks attempted to press an alarm button.",
