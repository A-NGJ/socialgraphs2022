 "content": "Joey Orsel was a Human male who, during the time of the Galactic Republic, was a passenger on a pleasure cruiser headed for Alderaan under the command of Captain Quasar. Also on the ship was Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was accompanied by a protocol droid called 68-RKO. A virulent hater of droids, Orsel accosted 68-RKO and ordered it to leave, in the process insulting Kenobi. The Jedi responded by tripping Orsel, sending the man flying through a nearby card table. Furious, Orsel drew a dagger, waited until Kenobi turned his back and leapt at his foe, only for Kenobi to quickly activate his lightsaber and run Orsel through without ever even pivoting to look at him.\nJoey Orsel made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Star Wars  24, written by Mary Jo Duffy and released in 1979. Orsel was illustrated by Carmine Infantino.",
