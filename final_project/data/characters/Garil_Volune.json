 "content": "Garil Volune was a Human man who lived on Ansion and one of the delegates to the Unity Council. He was not present at the official Jedi greeting on the planet. Instead, he participated in a meeting in the garden of the Kandah residence, which convinced those present to support the accession of Ansion to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, Volune was loyal to the Republic and urged the Jedi to be given more time to settle the Alwarich affair. During the vote, he voted, like most delegates, for remaining in the Republic.",
