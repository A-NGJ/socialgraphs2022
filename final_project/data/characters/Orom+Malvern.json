 "content": "Orom Malvern was a male Human who belonged to House Malvern, one of the six Great Houses of Serenno.\nFollowing the end of the Clone Wars, the male heirs of the Great Houses—except Adan Dooku— committed parricide when threatened by Darth Vader, the right-hand man of the newly crowned Galactic Emperor Palpatine. Following this event, known as the Cleansing of Serenno, Orom Malvern took his late father's mantle as head of House Malvern.\nMalvern's sister Cretia had married Rodas of the House Borgin. The latter considered Malvern an useful idiot, which was the only reason he never envisaged divorce. In 3 BBY, when the Great Houses struggled to choose a new regent for the House Dooku, Orom Malvern was the only support of his brother-in-law.\nFollowing the apparent \"death\" of Bron Dooku, Malvern was named Count of and Regent of Serenno.",
