 "content": "Scraper was a Human male Imperial stormtrooper who in 3 ABY was a member of an expedition led by Lieutenant Mils Giel to investigate the formerly Rebel-held Golrath Station. While slacking from their duties, Scraper and fellow trooper Carli inadvertently discovered that the stone in the station's walls had unique properties that allowed it to store and replay images of events and information that had happened nearby, potentially meaning that they could reveal vital Rebel secrets. However, a Rebel raid destroyed Golrath Station not long after Scraper's discovery.",
