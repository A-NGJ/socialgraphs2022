 "content": "Teers was a female Gungan who served as a Rep on the Gungan High Council.\nTeers became part of the Gungan High Council prior to the Invasion of Naboo. In 32 BBY, Teers was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi went to the Council and asked them to warn the Naboo that the Trade Federation was invading them. However, the Council wasn't interested in doing so, as the Gungans did not like the Naboo because they thought the Naboo felt they were smarter than them. Later, the Trade Federation forced the Gungans out of their home of Otoh Gunga and they fled to their sacred place. Teers was present when Queen Amidala of the Naboo asked the Gungans to help the Naboo to overcome their invaders. The Gungans were eventually convinced that the Naboo didn't think they were smarter than the Gungans and decided to help them. In the end, Naboo was liberated and the Gungans and Naboo found peace with each other.\nTeers had yellow eyes.",
