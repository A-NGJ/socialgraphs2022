 "content": "CR57 was a clone trooper commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, CR57 was part of a Republic task force sent to bring the planet Thustra back into the Republic camp. However, shortly after the clone commander and his troops landed, the native Sephi attacked the Republic forces, and CR57 was killed.\nCR57 was a clone trooper commander who was one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. The commander was born and trained on the planet Kamino to fight in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, the planet Thustra decided to secede from the Galactic Republic. CR57 was part of a strike force led by Jedi Generals Tyr and Tyffix that was tasked with landing on Thustra and making a show of force that would bring the native Sephi back into the Republic camp.\nHowever, Sephi troops attacked the Republic task force shortly after it landed on Thustra. CR57 commanded the soldiers on the southern perimeter during the battle. The Republic clone forces there came under heavy fire from Sephi troops, who overwhelmed them. CR57 was killed while reporting his status over comlink to the rest of the Republic forces.\nWhen Sephi troops overran CR57's position, the commander informed the other parts of the Republic army about his status until he was killed. Like all clone troopers, he stood 1.83 meters tall.\nCR57's only mention in Star Wars canon was in Jedi: Yoda, a comic book published by Dark Horse in 2004. However, CR57 was not pictured in the comic and had only two spoken lines.",
