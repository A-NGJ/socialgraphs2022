 "content": "Byzal was a male Human who served as a major in the security forces of the planet Kaon during the Galactic War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. When the Tion Hegemony was overtaken by an outbreak of the rakghoul plague, Kaon was the fifth planet to be hit, and Byzal tried to maintain the quarantine. However, shortly after offworld reinforcements arrived, a shuttle attempted to break quarantine, and Byzal was infected by a rakghoul while investigating the crash site. He transformed not long afterwards and was killed.\nMajor Byzal appears in the Flashpoint Kaon Under Siege, which was added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic in Game Update 1.1.",
