 "content": "Oppa was a tame and mischievous momong who lived during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war, Oppa was offered for sale as a pet by the vendor droid 80-T5, who operated a small stall within the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. The momong had yellow and grey fur and skin and yellow eyes.\nOppa first appeared as a purchasable pet in the 2010 Sony Online Entertainment MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures. He could be bought from the game's store for 400 station cash, a premium in-game currency. As the purchase is optional, this article makes no assumptions about whether it occurred.",
