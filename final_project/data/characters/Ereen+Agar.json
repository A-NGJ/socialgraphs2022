 "content": "Ereen Agar was a female Zabrak from Anobis. Early in her career, she worked as a guard, defending shipments for a transport company in the Mid Rim. During the Galactic Civil War, Ereen defended the crime lord, Vurrha Chur from a band of pirates on Tatooine. After this event, she starting working for Vurrha Chur's gang, Vurrha's Blood.\nA female Zabrak, Ereen Agar spent the early part of her life on the Zabrak colony world of Anobis, which was located in the Anobis system. At some point she worked as a hired guard for a transport company in the Mid Rim. While she worked for the company, Agar fought to protect cargo from both pirates and law enforcement agents. During the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, Agar was in a relatively small spaceport when it was attacked by pirates looking for easy prey. The pirates went after Agar and opened fire, but Agar fought back, killing two of the pirates with her heavy blaster pistol and three more with her vibroblade. After killing the pirates, Ereen Agar was approached by another individual who had been present during the attack, a Quarren crime lord named Vurrha Chur who ran a criminal organization named Vurrha's Blood. Due to Agar display of combat prowess, Chur offered her a position in his organization as an enforcer.\nAfter some time working for Vurrha Chur's organization, Agar had become a more ambitious individual and began acquiring wealth and favors from individuals who bribed her to leave them alone when she was assigned to come after them. She carefully built up her strength and kept individuals alive who she believed might become useful later. During her time working for Vurrha Chur, he considered her his top enforcer. She kept apart from the rest of Chur's employees, including Sevv Sunb, the Quarren crime lord's book keeper, who Agar disliked. While working for Chur, Agar slowly prepared for departing Vurrha's organization.\nEreen Agar stood 1.8 meters tall with light gray eyes, tan-colored skin, and brown hair, which she usually kept long and pulled back. Like most Zabraks, Agar had facial tattoos, which were thin, dark lines with a swirled pattern. In her work as a guard for a shipping company, Agar did not care whether she had to go up against pirates or law enforcement. Due to the influence of Vurrha Chur, Agar became more ambitious and willing to wait patiently for the long-term, although she was still annoyed by smaller setbacks. She was able to carefully control her emotions, but would show pleasure in causing violence in order to frighten her opponents. She enjoyed encountering challenging opponents and fought even more skillfully than usual in dangerous situations. Despite her preference for violence, Agar did not attack individuals without a purpose, since she saw that as a waste.\nAlthough she was careful and efficient, Ereen Agar would accept bribes and favors if she believed that it would help her in the long run. She wanted to gain enough riches and favors to prepare for her departure from Vurrha's Blood, but she patiently to gain further strength despite her dislike and indifference towards the rest of Vurrha's employees, including Sevv Sunb, Chur's book keeper. Agar's attitude towards Sunb made him dislike her, and led him to believe that she despised him for his lack of fighting skills. Although she spoke quietly, Agar was excellent at intimidating her opponents, and was experienced in surviving in rough places. Ereen Agar spoke and was literate in both Galactic Basic Standard and the Zabrak language.\nA Force-sensitive, Ereen Agar was largely untrained in using the Force, but she did follow her instincts and use the Force to enhance her physical abilities. She was skilled in combat with blaster pistols, blaster rifles, and heavy weaponry. She was also skilled in the use of melee weapons, including vibro weapons. In melee combat, Agar was extremely quick, and sometimes used the Force to give herself an edge. Although she did not regularly use armor, she was trained in how to use it. She was a capable pilot and was also somewhat skilled at treating wounds.\nWhile working for Vurrha's Blood, Ereen Agar owned a heavy blaster pistol and a vibroblade, both of which she wore openly. The heavy blaster and vibroblade had each been customized to be more deadly in combat. She also carried a grappling spike launcher, a medical kit, and a utility belt. In the belt, she stored a medpac, a tool kit, a glowrod, a comlink, and some emergency food capsules, as well as a spare power pack and energy cell to power her weapons. In order to fight more effectively in melee combat, Agar preferred wearing snug shirts along with loosely fitting jackets and pants that allowed her to move quickly and easily. For transportation, she owned a customized speeder bike that was modified to fly at greater speeds than a standard Ikas-Adno 22-B Nightfalcon speeder bike. At most times, Ereen Agar carried around eleven hundred credits on her person.\nEreen Agar was first featured as part of the villain chapter of Ultimate Adversaries, a 2004 sourcebook for the revised edition of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The book was written by Eric Cagle, Michelle Lyons, Michael Mikaelian, Steve Miller, Owen K.C. Stephens, and Wil Upchurch, with Daniel Falconer providing Ereen Agar's illustration. The book did not specify an era for Agar to appear in, and she was not necessarily affiliated with Vurrha's Blood. For the Rise of the Empire era and New Jedi Order era, the book stated that she could work as an escort or enforcer for a crime lord and in the Rebellion era, the book told she would be located away from the Empire. However, in the New Jedi Order era, it was suggested that she would only fight the invading Yuuzhan Vong if they threatened her. In 2008, Ereen Agar received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which stated that she worked for Vurrha Chur during the Galactic Civil War, confirming that she lived during the time of the Rebellion against the Empire.",
