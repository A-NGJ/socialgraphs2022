 "content": "Ardana Cinn was a female Twi'lek. During the Galactic Civil War she became a pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, where she scored the highest amongst her fellow pilots in flight simulations. She performed with enough skill and was deemed trustworthy enough to be selected by Leia Organa to be part of a team to uncover a mole within the Alliance. The team worked entirely off the books, with only Mon Mothma knowing of their existence outside of the team's members. As well as discovering the mole they were also tasked with finding a suitable planet on which the Alliance could set up a new base.\nArdanna Cinn first appeared in the second issue of the comic book series titled simply Star Wars published by Dark Horse Comics. The issue was written by Brian Wood, illustrated by Carlos D'Anda and colored by Gabe Eltaeb. It was released on February 13 2013.",
