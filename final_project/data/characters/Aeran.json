 "content": "Aeran was a female Human weapons expert who lived on Junction V and was a close friend to Cilia Dil during the final decades of the Republic Classic era.\nIn 44 BBY, she joined a select group, along with her friend Cilia, Stephin, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, flew to Delaware Luna to steal plans on the super-weapon, Annihilator. However, these weapons did not exist and it was just a rumor that Lorian Nod was using on Junction V. Aeran took this step in part of the mission, but not because she was exposed to no arrest warrant, but instead returned to the resistance movement.",
