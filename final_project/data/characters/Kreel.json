 "content": "Sergeant Kreel, designated Agent 5241, was a human male undercover stormtrooper and SCAR trooper of the Galactic Empire, serving in the 501st Legion under the direct command of Darth Vader. He operated as the gamemaster in Grakkus the Hutt's arena on Nar Shaddaa. He was tasked with training new candidates to fight in the arena, including Luke Skywalker. During Skywalker's arena fight with Kongo the Disemboweler, Agent 5241 contacted the Empire to inform them that Skywalker was on Nar Shaddaa. After his mission on Nar Shaddaa was complete, Kreel was given command of an elite group of SCAR troopers, designated Task Force 99.\nKreel was born on Chagar IX. When he was four, Kreel watched a man die. It made him cry like a baby for a dozen more times. Two years later, Kreel watched his own father being murdered in front of him, but he did not cry. His mother was also said to have died in the arenas. He then started to kill people and worked in the fighting pits. Kreel made the fighting pits his way of life in order to survive. Sometime later when Kreel first saw the Galactic Empire's stormtroopers, he viewed them as beautiful. After the Empire toppled Chagar IX's warlords and shut down the fighting pits, Kreel and his people were given jobs, a sense of purpose, and peace. When he was old enough, Kreel joined the Stormtrooper Corps.\nHe went to the Imperial Academy, where he befriended a ranger named Izak Anzio of Agamar. During their first mission together, Izak was killed by the Rebels' mortars before their transport landed. Kreel then killed every Rebel he could find that day and vowed to continue doing so. Kreel eventually became a sergeant in the 501st Legion.\nHe was recruited by the Sith Lord Darth Vader for a deep undercover assignment: to infiltrate Grakkus the Hutt's palace on Nar Shaddaa. He posed as one of Grakkus's greatest fighting slaves that he had bought. In his role, Kreel trained Wookiees, lizard men and space pirates to fight in the arena for Grakkus and his audience. He called himself the \"Gamemaster.\"\nEventually, he was given Luke Skywalker to train for Grakkus's games. Along with the MagnaGuards, Kreel taught Skywalker how to fight. He spoke with Grakkus and watched as the MagnaGuards fought Skywalker. Later, he was shown the beast that Skywalker would face. Kreel then took Skywalker to the arena to fight Kongo the Disemboweler. Kreel soon contacted a group of TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, informing them that Skywalker was there.\nKreel triggered Kongo's shock collar and then took out Grakkus's MagnaGuards using a lightsaber. He then arrested Grakkus, telling him that his arena was closed. He was joined by several of the TIE pilots who surrounded Skywalker. However, as they were taking Grakkus and Skywalker, Grakkus initiated an E.M.P. that disabled Kreel's and the TIE pilots' guns. Kreel then drew his lightsaber as Kongo was revived. Kreel attempted to subdue Skywalker but was attacked by Grakkus. He ordered the pilots and stormtroopers to capture Skywalker and his allies. Afterward, Kreel spoke with Vader about Skywalker as he showed the Sith Lord Grakkus' collection of Jedi artifacts.\nNot long after Nar Shaddaa, Kreel was given command of a SCAR trooper squad, Task Force 99. Kreel and the squad went to Sunspot Prison to find Kolar Ludd. Kreel and his squad were given a new assignment, on the Ghost Moon. There, they were able to shoot down the Rebels' Taylander shuttle. He and his squad then attacked the rebel forces, with Kreel destroying a tank with his lightsaber. The attack was successful, with Kreel and his squad capturing Admiral Verette, and interrogating him.\nKreel then had Verette tied to his shuttle and sent it to the captured Star Destroyer Harbinger as distraction, while he and his SCAR troopers boarded the Harbinger to retake it. Kreel then fought and dueled Skywalker, confirming to Luke that he was the Gamemaster from Grakkus's arena. During the fighting, Kreel was contacted by Vader and was warned not to injure Skywalker—a contact that allowed Skywalker to sense Vader's presence, leaving him distracted. Kreel took advantage of Luke's attempt to use the Force, which he claimed to just get in the way of true fighting skill—but before he could fully overpower the young Jedi, Luke struck out with a Force push that rocked the entire Star Destroyer, trapping Kreel under wreckage and debris. While Luke and the others escaped, Kreel ordered his team to salvage the mission by destroying the Star Destroyer, while he used his lightsaber to cut off his own arm at the shoulder, allowing him to rejoin them as they escaped the ship. While Vader was furious that Kreel and his SCAR team had thoroughly failed in every one of their objectives, Kreel and the Task Force escaped the brunt of his wrath by presenting a valuable captive: the protocol droid C-3PO.\nKreel and SCAR Squadron took 3PO to the Devastator, where they attempted to interrogate him in order to find the Rebel fleet or any new bases. However, Kreel was ordered to get rid of 3PO by Vader. Despite Vader's orders, Kreel decided to use 3PO as bait to lure the Rebels to them.\nKreel was later practicing his lightsaber skills when Vader came in and explained his disappointment about what happened on the Harbinger. However, Kreel convinced Vader to let him and his squad live. Vader then ordered the squad to go to the Horox system to eliminate a rebel base. Before leaving, the Emperor came, and Kreel knelt in honor. The Emperor told him to carry on and that the Empire needed more soldiers like him. He and his squad went to the Horox system, where they found villagers being ruled by a tyrant, whom they killed, gaining the respect of the villagers. They convinced them to give them the coordinates of the rebel base. On Horox III they found a rebel base and destroyed it.\nKreel and SCAR Squad later confronted the rebels again on the planet Crait, where the Rebels were attempting to build a new base. SCAR Squad engaged the rebel forces on the planet but were defeated. The squad was able to escape; however, Kreel's lightsaber was destroyed in a duel with Skywalker.",
