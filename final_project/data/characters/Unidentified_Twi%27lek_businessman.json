 "content": "During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, a Twi'lek male worked as a businessman. While on Coruscant in 3643 BBY, he needed to travel to the Old Galactic Market and argued with a shuttle operator over a travel advisory for that area.\nIn the year 3643 BBY, the businessman was on the Galactic Republic's capital planet Coruscant and attempted to travel to the Old Galactic Market from the taxi pad in the Senate Plaza. A travel advisory was in effect for that area, which was at that time the site of an armed revolt by the Migrant Merchants' Guild. The Twi'lek began arguing with a shuttle operator, insisting that he needed to get to the Old Galactic Market. The operator replied that he did not make the rules, being required to follow the advisory. The Twi'lek businessman informed the operator that he had a stun baton to protect himself and demanded to know if they were leaving. The operator then replied that the businessman had to sign a waiver first.\nThe businessman had blue eyes and green skin, and was willing to ignore the travel advisory for the Galactic Market.\nThe Twi'lek wore a green, brown, and white outfit with a black belt and green boots with a black pattern on them. He carried a stun baton for protection.\nThe Twi'lek businessman first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing game by BioWare. His NPC nameplate identifies him as \"Coruscant Businessman.\"",
