 "content": "Pon was a female Rodian who acted as one of the lieutenants of the Hutt crime lord Sinasu during the Galactic Civil War. After Sinasu became embroiled in a gang war with the rival Hutt Noako, agents of Noako torched Sinasu's Greentop Tower docking station on the moon Nar Shaddaa and Pon was badly burnt in the attack. Sinasu went into hiding in the base of the outlaw tech gang TechTank and Pon betrayed her employer's location to Cordol's Chain, a bounty hunter group in the employ of Noako, which subsequently commenced an attack on the TechTank facility.",
