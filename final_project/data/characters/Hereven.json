 "content": "Lieutenant Hereven was a male Human serving in the Galactic Scout Corps, nearly half a century before the Battle of Yavin. When Milac Troper returned to from an unknown jungle planet reporting Hereven's death, the Corps filled his death as unexplained and moved on. However, Hereven and Dayla Kev, the Mission Commander of the scouting party, had been attacked by a gasnit; Troper took their ship in his panic and let them. While hiding in a subterranean cavern, Hereven and Kev fell in love. Their time together was to be short, however. Hereven was killed while out hunting, leaving a pregnant Kev to fend for herself. When she gave birth, she named her son Hereven Kev, after her late lover.",
