 "content": "Rek Thelcar was a Human male member of the Lok Revenants who lived on Lok during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Rek Thelcar was a member of the Lok Revenants and a lieutenant of their leader Nym. He used to work in Nym's palace, in the city known as Nym's Stronghold.\nIn 1 ABY, Thelcar was involved in most major operations of the Lok Revenants. That year, the Lok Revenants assaulted the hideout of their enemies, the Sulfur Lake Pirates, to retrieve the valuable memory module of an Imperial droid. Rek Thelcar tasked a spacer involved in this mission to place surveillance devices all around the hideout so he would be able to spy the pirates after the assault. The same year, the Lok Revenants raided an Imperial mine where the release of an unknown toxic gas had made the miners become completely crazy and very hostile. Thelcar requested the spacer to extract DNA samples from the enraged miners in order to understand the effects of the gas. Later, the Revenants attacked an Imperial research facility on Lok to steal experimental weapons developed and produced there. This time, Rek Thelcar asked the spacer to interrogate scientists in the facility to determine the nature of the researches conducted by the Empire.\nRek Thelcar was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Rek Thelcar was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
