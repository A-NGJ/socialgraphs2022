 "content": "Am was a Force-sensitive human female who, along with her twin brother Karre, was created as a weapon of the dark side of the Force. Raised by the protocol droid B-2ON, Karre and Am were trained in the use of the dark side and equipped with prototype dark armor that used the power of a kyber crystal to strengthen their powers, and in their adolescence, the two were preparing to rule the Galactic Empire and use a new superweaponâ€”the Gemini-class Star Destroyer against the Republic when Karre unexpectedly stole the kyber crystal power core from the Star Destroyer.\nWhen Am confronted Karre, he rejected his armor and attempted to escape in an X-wing starfighter, but Am used the Force to pull the power core, and by extension Karre's starfighter, back to the Star Destroyer. Her strength was such that she ripped the core out of Karre's fighter and back to her on the surface of the Star Destroyer. Karre had held onto the crystal's container, and the two battled on the surface of the Destroyer, with Karre revealing that he had foreseen Am being overwhelmed by the power of the crystal and thus had attempted to steal it to save her.",
