 "content": "Chaan was a Supreme Commander of the Yuuzhan Vong.\nWhen Supreme Overlord Shimrra revealed the Slayers to the Elite, Chaan was one of the first to denounce them, going so far as to declare them Shamed Ones. Chaan also asked that proof be given of their fighting abilities, and Shimrra ordered Chaan and ten of his warriors to do battle with two of the Slayers. Chaan was displeased with a fight of eleven against two, but the two slayers easily—and literally—carved up Chaan and his warriors. Within seconds, Supreme Commander Chaan and his warriors were dead—lying in several pieces in the Hall of Confluence.",
