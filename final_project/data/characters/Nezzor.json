 "content": "Nezzor was a Male Human Moff of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. Nezzor was at the helm of the Imperial fleet in the Battle of Ruan and won in a rousing success for the Empire. Follwing the battle of Ruan, Nezzor commanded the first wave of Imperial warships to attack Duro, however the Republic, who knew of the attack ahead of time, had waited for his fleet and laid out a carefully planned trap. During the battle, Nezzor's fleet suffered heavy losses and realizing the battle was lost, he attempted to ram his damaged ship into one of the many civilian orbital cities above Duro, but was obliterated in the process. Although Nezzor was considered by the Minister of Logistics Davidge an unprofessional sociopath, on contrary the Dark Councilor Darth Marr believed in Nezzor's tactical acumen.",
