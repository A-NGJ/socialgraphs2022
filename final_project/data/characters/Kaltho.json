 "content": "Kaltho was a wealthy Hutt from a prominent Kajidic. His immense fortune was gained from daily intake of hundreds of thousands of credits earned through his ownership of many large spaceports and loading docks on Nar Shaddaa. His vast holdings allowed him to also branch into smuggling, weapons dealing and dealing in the spice trade.\nAt some time during the Galactic Civil War, Kaltho traveled to Cloud City to participate in an auction for the Jewel of Yavin, a valuable corusca gem. He traveled with a large retinue of Gamorrean and Nikto guards, servants, bookkeepers and his chief enforcer, Kerek.",
