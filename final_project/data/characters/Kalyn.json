 "content": "Kalyn was a Human female who lived on the planet Coruscant during the Cold War. She was abducted by the cyborg Krel and used as a subject in his experiments; Krel hoped to create \"sleeper\" cyborgs. After Krel's death at the hands of Havoc Squad, the unit's commander allowed the three survivors of Krel's experiments—Kalyn, Lox, and Parr—to go free after taking their information.\nKalyn appears in the Trooper class mission \"Destroying the War Droids\" on Coruscant in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released in 2011. Players can choose to let Kalyn and the others leave, or kill them for dark side alignment points.",
