 "content": "Bas Bishop was a male Human who worked for the pharmaceutical company Culpharm on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nBishop had a high up position within Culpharm and was senior to Carlitina Semla, the head of Culpharm Security. In about 32 BBY, some of Culpharm's specimen samples went missing, so Semla hired some freelance agents to find them. Bishop hassled Semla to try and make progress in resolving the issue.",
