 "content": "Matwe was a Human male who operated as a smuggler during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Matwe was raised on the planet Coruscant and from an early age, he explored the Coruscant underworld with his brother Rikard and became known within Coruscant's criminal community. After entering the service of the Pyke Syndicate as smugglers, Rikard became indentured to the cartel after botching a job for the Pykes, and Matwe vowed not to abandon his brother. Matwe was later among a group of Pyke-affiliated operatives who were assigned to hunt down the rogue Kadas'sa'Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos.",
