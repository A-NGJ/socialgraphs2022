 "content": "K'lial Khzrry was a con artist of the Xi'Dec species. K'lial and Diskio Khzrry were the only survivors of the Khzrry family unit, which was once well respected in the Xi'Dec community. K'lial was a well known con artist who often worked for Alliance Intelligence retrieving captive Rebel personnel.\nK'lial Khzzry was one of the last surviving members of the Khzrry family unit. The rest of the family unit was vacationing onboard the Savage Pleasure when the Galactic Empire attempted to assassinate Senator Mael Sidras. Everyone onboard was killed and K'lial and Diskio shifted their allegiances to support the Rebel Alliance.\nUsing their unusual species as a cover, the two insectoids would retrieve captured Rebel operatives who had been apprehended by local authorities. They would usually accomplish this through a combination of stubbornness, speed, and K'lial's smooth and pacifying voice. When this was not sufficient they would rely on Diskio's ability to deactivate and disable all sorts of security measures.\nWhen Rebel agent Basal Moor was captured by TransGalMeg Industries, Incorporated guards on the planet Pako Ramoon, K'lial was able to approach and confuse the guards with a tirade about wanting to use Moor's genetic material as integration into the Khzzry family unit. While the guards were distracted, K'lial removed the codekeys for Moor's restraints from the pocket of the head security guard. When the guards protested K'lial became very indignant while he secretly unlocked Moor's restraints. When the guards then tried to arrest them for interferring with their prisoner, Diskio used a hidden remote to cause their landspeeder to crash through the lobby entrance and all three Rebel operatives were able to make their escape.\nK'lial was a member of the Xi'Dec species and was more sociable of the two due to being more humanoid in appearance. When attempting to free a Rebel agent it was very stubborn and insistent on getting its way, quickly dominating any conversation and ignoring questions and comments from others. It would march in, take command of the situation and escape before anyone else had a moment to think about what had just happened. When local authorities would try and stop it, it would get highly indignant protesting loudly that it was being a victim of xenophobia.\nA decently skilled con artist, K'lial was able to talk fast and use its hypnotic voice to help keep local authorities off balance as the two Xi'Dec operatives would sweep Rebels right out of the Empire's grasp. K'lial was also decently talented at pickpocketing which it used to lift keycards and security passes during their extraction operations.\nAll K'lial would carry with it were two medpacs.\nK'lial Khzrry was designed by Chuck Truett for Cracken's Rebel Operatives, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1994. He was illustrated by Doug Shuler.",
