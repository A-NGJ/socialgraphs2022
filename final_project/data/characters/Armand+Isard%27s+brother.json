 "content": "Director of Imperial Intelligence Armand Isard had a male Human brother who served the Galactic Republic during the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY. During the conflict, which was fought against the Stark Commercial Combine, the leader of the Combine, Iaco Stark, released a Navcomputer virus into the Navigation computers of the Republic Navy. The ship on which Isard's brother was serving was one of those affected, and it was destroyed when it came out of Hyperspace into a star while en route to the planet Troiken. Isard's brother perished in the crash and the director would later remember his brother's fate in 3 BBY, when discussing the war with Imperial Intelligence Agent Jahan Cross.\nArmand Isard's brother was first mentioned in the 2011 comic book Agent of the Empire â€“ Iron Eclipse 1, which was written by John Ostrander as part of the \"Iron Eclipse\" story arc of the Star Wars: Agent of the Empire series.",
