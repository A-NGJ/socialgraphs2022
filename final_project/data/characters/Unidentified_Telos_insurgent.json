The insurgent was with Welleques and other insurgents participating in a weapon trade with a client the client seemed suspicious but before the insurgents could fire. the client revealed himself as the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and defeated all the insurgents. However, Jinn failed to interrogate Welleques, since before he could answer any question he was killed by Dairoki.\nThe Telos insurgent appeared in 2011 in Jediâ€”The Dark Side 4 the fourth of 5 issues of the Jedi The dark side comic book series which was designed as a prequel to the Jedi Apprentice novel series of Jude Watson. The issue was written by Scott Allie and illustrated by Mahmud Asrar .",
