 "content": "This Keshiri was the wife of Kesh resident Wertram and together they had a daughter. Her husband worked as a tailor in the city of Tahv. Eventually, he placed their daughter under the tutelage of a prominent teacher and geologist, Adari Vaal, a neighbor of theirs. There, her daughter learned controversial theories about the formation of Kesh's continents, contradicting the prevalent Keshiri religion. Although she never left her hut for anything, at one time she accompanied her husband in visiting Adari. They found only her mother, Eulyn, and expressed their concern about her daughter's teachings.",
