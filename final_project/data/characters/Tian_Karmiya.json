 "content": "Tian Karmiya was an Ilohian human female who served in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. Karmiya studied at the Carida Academy, where she received prime marks. However, she was rumored to have reported two students with better grades for selling their exam answers, resulting in their expulsion, while she was rewarded with a place in a merit society. Following the academy, Karmiya served aboard the Enigma and Victory at Batonn with fine service. Karmiya eventually obtained the military rank of commander, and served as executive officer aboard the Ultimatum of Death Squadron.\nIn 3 ABY, the Ultimatum was present in the Hoth asteroid field searching for the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon. Karmiya discussed the recent execution of Admiral Kendal Ozzel with Captain Canonhaus, and was ordered to transfer from the bridge to auxiliary control. Shortly afterward, the bridge was destroyed by an asteroid collision.",
