 "content": "Zyne Kinahay was the son of Eben Kinahay, an antiques dealer. Zyne was a tall lanky man with a muscular frame. He was known as a criminal in the Core Worlds, but he was also a devotee of the dark side.\nEben wished for his son to follow in his footsteps, but Zyne wanted no part of his father's work and decided to travel the galaxy in search of more information on the Sith.\nDuring the First Corellian Insurrection, he went to Centerpoint Station to retrieve his father's Sith holocron, but failed due to Eben's security measures.",
