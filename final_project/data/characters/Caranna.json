 "content": "Caranna was a female Twi'lek who worked as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars. At some point during the conflict, she and the bounty hunter Tendin Vought met with a droid, who sought to hire the pair to attack a star liner. Caranna was impressed by the way Vought negotiated with the droid, but she suspected that he planned to betray her, so she used a drug patch to incapacitate Vought. She then offered to complete the droid's job by herself.\nCaranna was a Twi'lek female. She was talkative, and had a high-pitched voice. However, she was also very professional and was considered to be one of the galaxy's best bounty hunters.",
