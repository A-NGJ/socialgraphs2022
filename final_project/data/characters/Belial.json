 "content": "Belial was a Devaronian male who held the rank of Cloud in the marauder organization known as the Nihil. Serving under Lourna Dee's Tempest, Belial worked at the monitoring station aboard his commander's eponymous cruiser. During the Thirty-ninth Emergence, Belial detected that the debris leaving hyperspace did not contain the Legacy Run's flight recorder. Dee considered Belial to be smart, capable, unemotional, and cool in a crisis. She also predicted that he would soon rise up the ranks of the Nihil to become a Storm.",
