 "content": "Kaj Loomit was a human male technician and scavenger. During the Clone Wars, he posed as a Galactic Republic trader on Kamino. He was actually working as a saboteur for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He worked to destroy a simulation chamber, but his work was interrupted by a group of delegates. He quickly overrode a group of the training droids, but was defeated.\nKaj Loomit appears in Fantasy Flight Games' roleplaying adventure Begun, The Clone Wars Have!, released exclusively for attendees of GenCon in 2019. He can be killed or allowed to escape at the end.",
