 "content": "Viscount Tardi was the Minister of Finance for the Rebel Alliance during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. A wealthy financier who was known for his ceremonial skill as well as his place in galactic finance, in 3 ABY, Tardi worked with Princess Leia Organa to negotiate a large sale of T-65 X-wing starfighters for the Rebel fleet. Tardi and Organa made plans to finance the transaction through the Bank of Aargau, but Tardi died about a month before their trip to Aargau was scheduled. As Tardi's presence was crucial for the transaction going through, the Rebels faked his presence with a replica droid.\nTardi was first mentioned in Star Wars  48, written by Larry Hama and released in 1981. Although a replica droid posing as Tardi appears in the comic, Tardi himself is revealed to be dead at the story's climax.",
