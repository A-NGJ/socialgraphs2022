 "content": "Ralsius Paldora was a human male turncoat who served as a specialist in the Galactic Empire before deserting.\nAfter deserting, Paldora made his way to the planet Takodana where he would, in exchange of safe passage off the planet and asylum, provided information to Han Solo in the form of data cubes, one for the New Republic that contained Imperial shipping routes, refueling locations, and hidden armaments, and another which contained what Solo needed to be able to get onto the planet Kashyyyk during his attempts to liberate the Wookiee homeworld.\nAccording to Paldora, most of the information came from an Imperial officer called Rax. Following a brief skirmish with Imperial forces, the smuggler was able to successfully get Paldora offworld.\nPaldora was a human male who preferred Merenzane Gold.\nRalsius Paldora was a character created for the 2017 video game Star Wars Battlefront II, where he was voiced by Oliver Vaquer. Writer Mitch Dyer conceived the character to be played by Vaquer after enjoying the actor's performance as Robert Lutece in the 2013 video game BioShock Infinite. The character's dialogue was written by Walt Williams.",
