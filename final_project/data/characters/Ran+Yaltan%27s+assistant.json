 "content": "A Kessurian criminal worked as an assistant to Ran Yaltan. Around 382 BBY, Yaltan and the assistant were present in the Holy City on Jedha, and Yaltan posed as the last member of the Truthsayers of Bpfassh in order to scam the citizens of the city of zukkels. As Yaltan stood on a stage and informed a crowd they were about to witness the exploration of the Force, the Kessurian took a donation plate through the crowd to collect zukkels. The assistant eventually made their way to the Jedi Vildar Mac and Matthea Cathley, and the Kessurian asked Mac if he wanted to donate. Mac, however, was hesistant and said he had no zukkels, before the plate was knocked out of the assistant's hand by a real Truthsayer of Bpfassh, who called Yaltan a fraud and charlatan who only sought to line their pockets.",
