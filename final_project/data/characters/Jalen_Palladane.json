 "content": "Jalen Palladane was the infant son of the covert Jedi Knight Gorlan Palladane and Roah Palladane in the Outer Rim world of Chelloa during the Republic Dark Age. He was the younger brother of Aneese Palladane, and their family lived in the mining colony of Jenith. In 1032 BBY, his parents sheltered the female Jedi Knight Kerra Holt, the last surviving member of the ill-fated Operation Influx. Following the arrest of his father by Sith Lord Daiman, Daiman's forces plundered and murdered the inhabitants of Jenith. During the crackdown, the Palladane home was invaded by a pair of Sith troopers. However, the Palladanes were rescued by Holt, who slew the two home invaders.",
