 "content": "A Human male was a member of the self-proclaimed Sith Lord X1's faction of the Galactic Empire, which opposed the New Republic in the Galactic Civil War. At one point, he was stationed at the Imperial prison on the planet Dathomir, which X1's forces controlled. When X1 relocated his troops to the planet Mustafar, the Human was among the few remaining soldiers left behind at the prison, as it simultaneously came under attack from both the Nightsisters clan of the Witches of Dathomir and the New Republic's Grey Squadron, led by X1's clone \"brother,\" X2. During the battle, the Human successfully infiltrated Grey Squadron's landing site, planting detpacks on their X-wing starfighters and inflicting heavy casualties to the unit. X2 captured the Human and interrogated him regarding X1's plans, but the saboteur refused to reveal anything, leading X2 to Force-choke him in anger.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, a Human male was a member of a splinter faction of the Galactic Empire that was led by a Force-sensitive clone named X1, a self-proclaimed Sith Lord. As part of his training, the Human was taught how to resist Jedi mind tricks. Serving X1 in the latter's fight against the New Republic, the Human was at one point stationed on the planet Dathomir as part of a contingent guarding the Imperial prison, which X1 used to conduct cloning experiments. Eventually, X1 abandoned the facility and relocated his main forces to the planet Mustafar, leaving behind a small regiment, including the Human, to operate the Dathomir prison. After X1 left, however, a group of Nightsisters—a sect of the native Witches of Dathomir—attacked the facility. Almost simultaneously, the New Republic unit Grey Squadron arrived on the planet in an attempt to locate X1. Grey Squadron was led by the clone named X2, who was X1's genetic \"brother\" and also a Jedi Knight. X2 took with him a small portion of his squadron and left to investigate the prison, leaving the rest of his men at their landing site to guard their X-wing starfighters.\nSeeing an opportunity to sabotage the enemy's efforts, the Human slipped to the landing site undetected and planted detpacks on the majority of Grey Squadron's X-wings. The resulting explosions inflicted heavy casualties for the New Republic forces and took many X-wings out of commission. During the commotion, however, the Imperial saboteur was captured by the surviving pilots. X2 soon arrived back at the site after finishing his mission at the prison and discovering that X1 had moved to Mustafar. The saboteur was brought before X2, who questioned him regarding what X1's plans were on Mustafar. The saboteur refused to speak, claiming that his training would protect him against any Force influence X2 could attempt. Angered, the Jedi then used the Force to choke the saboteur but was soon stopped and calmed down by one of the Grey Squadron members, Shara. The remainder of Grey Squadron then left the planet in pursuit of X1.\nThe Human saboteur was loyal to his master, X1, refusing to reveal the latter's plans to X2. He was dismissive toward Jedi and their Force-influencing powers, claiming that his training would protect him against any mind tricks. The Human had light skin.\nThe saboteur wore the gray uniform of an Imperial Army pilot, complete with a helmet, during his service on Dathomir.\nThis character appeared exclusively in the Nintendo DS version of the 2009 video game Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron at the end of the first mission of Act III. The game does not elaborate on the character's fate, making it unclear whether he was choked to death or if Shara stopped X2 in time to save the man's life.",
