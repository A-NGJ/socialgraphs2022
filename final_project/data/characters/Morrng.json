 "content": "Morrng was a Trandoshan bounty hunter. He was a member of the Bounty Hunters Guild, but was quite inexperienced. Sometime following 0 BBY, he was hired by Didina Lippinoss to kill Crev Bombaasa, who had been blackmailing her. However, en route to Bombaasa he was attacked by one of Bombaasa's underlings, who killed him.\nMorrng was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species, gender, and appearance of Morrng changed each time a player performed this quest. However, the quest dialogue given by Crev Bombassa established Morrng as a male Trandoshan.\nAdditionally, his name was inconsistently spelled as both \"Morrng\" and \"Mornng.\" As \"Morrng\" appeared more often, this article assumes it to be the canonical name.",
