 "content": "Arl'Tokor was a Cathar merchant who lived on the planet Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A brown-spotted Cathar male with brownish-orange fur, a brown mane, and orange eyes, he was one of many of his species who settled on Taris. A fluent speaker of Basic, Arl'Tokor wore heavy armor for protection from the world's wildlife. He sold weapon and armor modifications from his shop in Olaris, the headquarters of the Republic-sponsored Taris Resettlement Initiative.\nArl'Tokor appeared in the massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Mods Vendor for Republic players on Taris. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, he was removed from the game along with the rest of the Mods Vendors.",
