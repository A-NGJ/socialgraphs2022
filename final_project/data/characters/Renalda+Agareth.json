 "content": "Renalda Agareth was a Human female who lived on Coruscant during the Cold War. When her brother Braedon was forcibly pressed into service by the Justicars' Brigade, she asked a Republic-allied individual to help save him.\nRenalda and her brother Braedon lived in the Justicars' Sector, a region on Coruscant controlled by the militant vigilante group known as the Justicars' Brigade. They lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, surviving the widespread violence and destruction in the years that followed the Sacking of Coruscant by the Sith.\nBy the year 3643 BBY, both of the Agareth's parents had died and Braedon, at the age of 15, was raising his sister on his own. But one night, Braedon was caught by the Justicars out after curfew and because he looked older, he was pressed into indentured service as a Justicar. Renalda asked a Republic-allied individual to rescue Braedon, but Braedon told the hero that the Justicars would simply capture him again if his name remained in their file of curfew violations. While the individual destroyed the files, Braedon went into hiding and told them that he would contact Renalda when it was safe. They returned to Renalda and told her that Braedon would find her when it was safe.\nRenalda Agareth was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. Renalda gives Republic characters the mission \"Justicar Injustice\", where she asks them to save her brother Braedon from Justicar service.",
