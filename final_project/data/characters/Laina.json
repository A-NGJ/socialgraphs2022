 "content": "Laina was the daughter of Ryland, a trooper in the Rebel Alliance, and Fiona. She was born on a mining colony on a moon in the Outer Rim Territories where her parents worked. After her mother was executed as a result of being framed for being a rebel spy, Laina and her father escaped with the help of her aunts Eron and Rhee. She lived with her father on Yavin 4 for a while, but in 0 BBY, for her own safety, Ryland decided to send his daughter to live with her aunts, who intended to take her to live on Alderaan.",
