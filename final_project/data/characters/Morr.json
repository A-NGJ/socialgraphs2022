 "content": "Morr was a female Defel bounty hunter.\nMorr, a Defel, became a bounty hunter when a trader broke his word with several other Defel. Morr hunted the man down and brought him to answer for his betrayal. She found that her natural abilities granted her a great advantage in her new profession, and that she greatly liked hunting.\nShe utilized both the fact that most beings believed Defel to be legends and the vast subterranean complexes of many planets in order to take unsuspecting bounties by surprise. She was fiercely loyal to the few friends and contacts she had established, and was disgusted by those who did not keep their word.",
