 "content": "Ekhrikhor was a Noghri of the Clan Bakh'tor.\nEkhrikhor was the leader of the group that followed the Millennium Falcon to Wayland, after it was discovered that Grand Admiral Thrawn was using the facility to make clones during the early years of the New Republic. Ekhrikhor and his band of Noghri spent much of their time concealed, working to make a path toward Mount Tantiss for Luke's group while keeping the native Psadans and Myneyrsh at bay. After their discovery by the group, Ekhrikhor, on the suggestion of Luke, started the Noghri practice of addressing Han as 'Han clan Solo' instead of 'The Consort of the Lady Vader.'\nAfter the Republic liberated Wayland from Imperial control, Ekhrikhor tried to destroy the multitude of artifacts found inside Mount Tantiss, claiming that everything within was part of the memory of Palpatine and should be eradicated. Garv Debble, an archaeologist, protested, and Leia Organa Solo eventually had to step in and allow Debble the opportunity to complete his work. Ekhrikhor abided by Leia's decision, even if he didn't agree with it.",
