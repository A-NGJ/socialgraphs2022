 "content": "Kalia Kulmina was a female Zabrak bounty hunter who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKalia Kulmina was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nBecause Kalia Kulmina spawned under the generic \"bounty_hunter\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of five possible depictions. Kulmina could appear as male Rodian, a Human male wearing Ubese raider armor, a Human female wearing Mabari armor, an IG-series assassin droid, and a female Zabrak wearing Bounty Hunter Armor. Because the quest dialogue identified Kulmina as a female Zabrak, this article assumes that the female Zabrak depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.",
