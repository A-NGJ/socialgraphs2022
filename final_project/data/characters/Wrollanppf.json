 "content": "Wrollanppf, also known as One-Eyed Volant the Eviscerator, was a female Wookiee gladiator who was among the enslaved combatants at the Grakkus Arena on Nar Shaddaa. According to a preliminary advertisement presented by Papa Toren to Grakkus the Hutt, Wrollanppf was scheduled to face the Lasat Zandarreo in a match to the death. The advertisement billed the pair as \"One-Eyed Volant the Eviscerator\" and \"Zandarreo, Jetsam of Lasan.\" A copy of the poster promoting Wrollanppf's prospective match against Zandarreo was placed in the pages of Maz Kanata's Smuggler's Guide while it was in Toren's possession.\nWrollanppf later instigated a slave uprising at Grakkus Arena during the opening of what would have been the arena's 7,072nd death match. This uprising was recorded by the former gladiator droid Stabinator in the pages of Maz Kanata's Smuggler's Guide after it ended up in Wrollanppf's possession.\nWrollanppf was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide by Daniel Wallace.",
