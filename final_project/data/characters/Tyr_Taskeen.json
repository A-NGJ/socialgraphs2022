 "content": "Tyr Taskeen was a skilled Alderaanian Rebel general during the Galactic Civil War. Originally the owner of his own starship sales business, Taskeen was enraged when the Galactic Empire nationalized his company and enslaved his nonhuman employees. He joined the nascent Rebellion on his homeworld of Alderaan and quickly rose to the rank of general due to his skills in setting up and operating secret bases in the Outer Rim Territories.\nTaskeen was the commander of the Rebel forces on Abridon in 3 ABY, where he convinced Brenn Tantor, the Imperial general who had conquered his forces, to defect to the Rebel Alliance after Tantor was ordered to massacre a refugee camp. After Tantor's defection, Taskeen supervised him, overseeing such operations as the theft of an All Terrain Armored Transport and the reconquest of Abridon. Taskeen was also one of the Rebel generals present at the Battle of Endor, liaising with Tantor yet again. That working relationship continued into the New Republic, as Taskeen commanded the conquest of Coruscant with Tantor in control of tactical operations underneath him.\nTyr Taskeen, a Human male native of the planet Alderaan, never expected to become a military man. After completing his education, he began a career as a free-ranging independent starship dealer, selling advanced starships to spaceports and individuals, mostly in the Outer Rim Territories. That business strategy helped him expand rapidly until he was running a large and very profitable company.\nHis world came crashing down when the Galactic Empire nationalized his company at some point before the year 0 BBY. Additionally, many of his nonhuman employees were taken into slavery. Furious, Taskeen returned to Alderaan, where he knew he would be able to find contacts who could help him join the Rebellion.\nAlthough he lacked a military background, Taskeen had many other attributes that made him extremely useful to the Rebellion. His personal wealth, business experience, numerous contacts, and familiarity with the Outer Rim Territories put him in a position to build and manage several Rebel bases in the Rim.\nThese skills, and his success in using them, soon brought him to the attention of the Rebel leadership. He received promotion after promotion, until he gained the rank of general. While not a tactical genius, Taskeen was a skilled administrator, competent officer, and exceptionally dedicated to the cause.\nFollowing the Alliance's victory over the Empire's Death Star battlestation at the Battle of Yavin, Taskeen was present at a ceremony in which Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca were awarded the Medal of Bravery for their part in the battle.\nIn 3 ABY, Taskeen commanded a Rebel force that captured Abridon in cooperation with the Abridon Nationalists. While initially a great victory for the Rebellion, the mission swiftly became a disaster. The Imperials counterattacked within days, devastating Rebel positions around the capital city, retaking the capitol, and capturing several Rebel dignitaries sent to negotiate with the Abridon government, one of whom was Jedi hero Luke Skywalker. Finally, the Imperial ground forces crushed the final Rebel base, with Taskeen unable to halt their reconquest. Taskeen, listening in on Imperial transmissions, heard Grand General Brashin issue the order to destroy a refugee camp filled with innocent civilians. General Brenn Tantor, the commander who had so devastated Taskeen's forces, refused. Brashin exchanged harsh words with his subordinate and locked him out of command.\nTaskeen saw an opportunity, and he took it. He surreptitiously contacted Tantor, offering the Imperial general a comm frequency to contact him if Tantor was willing to consider defection. Shortly thereafter, Tantor contacted him with the information that he would be at Kalaan in two days.\nTaskeen rushed to Kalaan and set up a temporary base to await Tantor's defection, fully aware that it could be an Imperial trap. Nevertheless, it would have been irresponsible to let pass the opportunity to recruit such an exceptionally skilled and highly placed Imperial officer. Tantor escaped from Imperial custody on Kalaan and brought with him a fantastic series of bonuses: a Tracked Mobile Base command vehicle, a squad of defecting stormtroopers, and most impressively of all, Luke Skywalker, who had also been incarcerated on Kalaan.\nTantor was brought to a Rebel fleet in orbit, where Taskeen met him in person for the first time. To the defector's surprise, Taskeen's soldiers immediately took him into custody. Taskeen allowed Tantor to squirm in the brig before finally going to meet with him. Taskeen questioned Tantor's usefulness, and the ex-Imperial offered to prove himself by capturing an All Terrain Armored Transport. Cautiously intrigued, Taskeen was willing to commit, but Tantor claimed that first he needed to rescue Beri Tulon, an Imperial colonel and Tantor's mentor, who had attempted to defect on Abridon. Now imprisoned on the planet Ruul, Tantor knew that he had knowledge of an AT-AT manufacturing facility. Still suspicious of Tantor's loyalty, but unwilling to pass up the opportunity to put such a powerful machine in the hands of Alliance technicians, Taskeen assented to Tantor's plan, but warned him that he would remain under Taskeen's watchful eye.\nTaskeen and Tantor set up an ambush on the convoy carrying Tulon to the Tarkin Detention Facility. Tantor performed wonderfully both in the ambush and in a raid on a nearby Imperial computer complex that obtained the access codes to the walker manufacturing facility on Trasse. Taskeen's suspicions were not yet allayed, but he was slowly gaining confidence in Tantor.\nNow supervising yet another ex-Imperial, Taskeen was pleased when Tantor and Tulon managed to seize an AT-AT from Trasse without complications. However, he had no time to celebrate, as Grand General Brashin appeared in the system aboard the Star Destroyer Inquisitor. Tantor was forced to rush to take control of a planetary ion cannon and successfully seized it and disabled the Star Destroyer.\nWith the successful completion of the mission, Taskeen began to put more trust in Tantor. He placed the General in command of a mission to Abridon due to Tantor's experience with the Imperial positions there. There, Taskeen observed approvingly from the Nebulon-B frigate Lucky Star as Tantor trounced the Imperial garrison he himself had installed and freed a camp of prisoners, including Hamman Flatt, the former lieutenant governor of Abridon. Flatt told Taskeen and Tantor that in gratitude, the Abridon Nationalists would make available several A-wings from the shipyards of Sayan. With knowledge of the upcoming Battle of Endor, Taskeen was eager to add to the Alliance's starfighter complement. Tantor fought his way through the war-torn city, and a Hover Transport full of pilots safely flew the A-wings to Sullust, where the Rebel fleet was preparing to attack the Death Star II.\nTaskeen and Tantor then returned to the main Rebel force. Tyr Taskeen was one of four generals involved in planning, supervising, and executing the ground mission to destroy the shield projector on Endor. General Crix Madine was the primary planner, while Tantor, who had helped set up the shield bunker as an Imperial, oversaw the operation from the Lambda-class shuttle Tydirium. General Han Solo led the commando squad that actually destroyed the bunker. Taskeen supervised Tantor's performance and served as liaison with high command amidst the fleet battle.\nThe incredible victory at Endor resulted in the deaths of Emperor Palpatine, Supreme Commander Darth Vader, Grand Admiral Nial Declann, and many more important Imperials, throwing the Galactic Empire into chaos. As numerous warlords broke away from the Empire, Admiral Gial Ackbar dispatched the First Fleet under Admiral Firmus Nantz on a campaign in the Western Reaches. Nantz drove the forces of the Imperial warlord Admiral Sander Delvardus from Glova, while Taskeen led a ground attack with the assistance of Sullustan irregular troops. Nantz's forces proceeded on to Glom Tho, where Taskeen once more commanded a ground operation, overseeing the capture of several foundries. However, the Empire was not destroyed. Over two more years of battle would be required before the Rebel Alliance, now the New Republic, undertook the invasion of Coruscant, capital of the Empire.\nTaskeen, in cooperation with the New Republic high command, directed General Tantor to land a force just small enough to avoid detection by Coruscant's advanced sensor net near the north pole. That force disabled the sensor nodes in that region and cleared the way for the New Republic to land a massive assault force undetected. Tantor next breached the defensive wall along the edge of the ice cap and captured a series of vital Imperial facilities, including a hospital, repair bay, artillery platforms, and walker storage depots.\nRepublic forces pushed on to the final battleground: the Imperial Palace itself. Facing off against the ferocious Imperial defense, commanded by his old nemesis Grand General Brashin, Tantor pounded through layer after layer of Imperial armor, weapons emplacements, and air support until a final infantry invasion secured the Imperial Palace. Throughout the entire battle, Taskeen continued his role as Tantor's supervisor, defining his overall strategic objectives.\nIt was then that Tantor discovered that his brother, Dellis, long thought dead at the hands of the Empire, had been held in a dungeon in the sublevels of the Palace. Taskeen was there to meet the brothers as they emerged from the Palace. Taskeen warmly congratulated his friend and welcomed Dellis to freedom. Looking out at the crowd celebrating the New Republic's victory, Taskeen anticipated a bright future.\nTyr Taskeen had red-brown hair, brown eyes, and fair skin. Taskeen did not begin his career as a fiery freedom fighter but as a businessman. However, neither was he a cold-hearted credit-counter who joined the Rebellion simply because the Empire took his company from him. Taskeen was driven as much by principle as by revenge, though the two mingled in the Empire's enslavement of his nonhuman employees.\nTaskeen remained exceptionally devoted to the Rebellion, and later to the New Republic. He was extremely suspicious of Tantor for several missions, entrusting the former Imperial with barely enough matériel to accomplish his objectives, though he was pragmatic enough to accept Tantor's loyalty after the delivery of the AT-AT.\nDespite being a general, Taskeen's primary talents were those of a businessman: administration and organization. During battles, he allowed Tantor to run the tactical show while he supervised and made sure overall objectives were met. Apparently these skills were enough to impress the Rebel and New Republic high command, as Taskeen was entrusted with vital roles in the battles of Endor and Coruscant.\nTyr Taskeen was created for the 2000 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Force Commander, in which he was voiced by Michael Bell. The June 2012 Star Wars Insider 133 feature \"Rogues Gallery\" by Leland Chee retconned Taskeen as one of the previously unidentified Rebels who stood behind Princess Leia Organa during the closing scene of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.",
