 "content": "Bailie was a Human male officer who served Galactic Empire during the Galactic Empire. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Captain Bailie was assigned to an Imperial space station in the Outer Rim Territories, along with Lieutenant Alin, Captain Clough, Warrant Officer Snopell, Lieutenant Farin and Major Taison. In 1 ABY, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer captured a passenger freighter on suspicion of harboring criminals. Several spacers were apprehended and taken to the Imperial Space station. After the spacers were released, Captain Bailie processed them through the space station until they left the station.\nBailie was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nCaptain Bailie was added to the game when the developers revamped the \"New Player Tutorial\" with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. Throughout the tutorial, Bailie and other Imperial officers directed new players through a space station in order to help them get accustomed to the game mechanics. However, Bailie was removed alongside with this tutorial when the developers introduced a completely new tutorial with the release of the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
