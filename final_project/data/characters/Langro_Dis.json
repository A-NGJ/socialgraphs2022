 "content": "Langro Dis was a male Dug from the planet Malastare who operated as a bounty hunter shortly after the Battle of Endor. Langro was distinguished from his kind by his near-albino appearance; having pale, white skin and flame-red eyes.\nLangro Dis hoped to make a name for himself as a hunter when he accepted a bounty on Krova the Hutt from the New Republic. Dis tracked the Hutt to the Pluthan system, and successfully captured her. However, it was believed that Krova allowed herself to be captured, in order to \"clear her name\". Dis delivered her to Hundria Kast, though Krova apparently made a deal that would ensure her freedom. Unfortunately, a group of Dark Jedi led by Noth attacked the Hutt, seeking a Sith holocron Krova had previously swallowed for safe-keeping. Langro was caught up in the fighting, and barely escaped with his life.\nLangro Dis piloted a modified YT-1300 light freighter named Glorious Spectrum.",
