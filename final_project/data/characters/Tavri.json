 "content": "Tavri was a male Twi'lek mercenary active during the Galactic Civil War. Tavri worked with the detective Nim Bola for a time.\nTavri left his homeworld at an early age and wandered the Galaxy. He spent most of his time in the Fringe to avoid being caught up in the Galactic Civil War. A mishap with the Imperials led him to being locked up in a prison where Bola was investigating a prison break. The detective made a deal for Tavri's freedom and the Twi'lek became his loyal bodyguard.\nTavri was with Bola on Tatooine when the detective was stalked by a pair of bounty hunters. The Twi'lek help Bola ambush and kill the two hunters in an alley in Mos Eisley. Later, he kept watch as Bola made a deal to sell the droid R2-Z1. Tavri noticed that they were being observed and made his way to the top of the docking bay where he found a pair of Ossans guarding a Jenet who was spying on the meeting. Tavri managed to stun the Ossans and kill the Jenet before they could report to the Imperials.",
