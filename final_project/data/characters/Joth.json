 "content": "Joth was a Human male who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. He was an officer of the Corellian Security Force.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Joth was a lieutenant of the Corellian Security Force, stationed in Coronet City. In 1 ABY, he went to work with a spacer who was highly recommended by his colleague, Lieutenant Mack Jasper.\nLieutenant Joth tasked the spacer to track down rumors about \"dangerous things coming\" reported by an informant known as Ja'inn. The spacer learn from Ja'inn that one of her contacts, the Bothan smuggler Moril, got scared after shipping some odd items to a group that he couldn't name. When he was interrogated by the spacer, Moril confessed he was hired to deliver animal feed, chemicals and tranquilizer materials to an isolated building and what he saw there terrified him. Lieutenant Joth therefore ordered the spacer to go to the drop location for Moril's shipment and investigate the area. The spacer quickly discovered that the building was an illegal lab, a lab specialized in bio-engineering creatures through dangerous genetic experiments. Lieutenant Joth therefore ordered the spacer to cripple the operations. The spacer thus killed Doctor Maldien, the Chief Scientist of the lab. The spacer then fought the engineered beasts and managed to kill them all. Finally, the spacer overloaded the lab's central computer, destroying all the research data collected. Lieutenant Joth was annoyed by the carnage but satisfied that the beasts were prevented to escape in Coronet.\nJoth appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Joth was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
