 "content": "A Sullustan male individual lived on the planet of Coruscant during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. At that time, the Sullustan served as a Scenes of Crimes Officer for the Coruscant Security Force's Forensics Unit. In 22 BBY, the officer responded along with several other SOCOs and the CSF's Anti-Terrorism Unit to Depot Bravo Five of the Grand Army of the Republic. The depot was the scene of an attack by Separatist terrorists. During the investigation, GAR Sergeant Kal Skirata requested the SOCOs process the scene instead of members of his Special Operations Brigade. The officer was grateful for the confidence the Special Operations Brigade, namely Skirata, placed in the CSF's capabilities.\nThe Sullustan officer appeared in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, written by Karen Traviss and published in 2006.",
