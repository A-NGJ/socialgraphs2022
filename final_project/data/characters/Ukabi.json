 "content": "Ukabi was a Human male cyborg who lived on Nar Shaddaa, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He worked as a crime boss, and his refusal to ally himself with the Empire started a conflict that ultimately caused his death and severely damaged his organization's business on the planet.\nUkabi led an Exchange-affiliated criminal organization in Nar Shaddaa's Corellian Sector. In 3643 BBY, Imperial diplomat Maro Vizhen was sent to oversee the creation of the Shadow Syndicate, which would unite four powerful crime bosses, including Ukabi, in an alliance with the Empire. Ukabi, however, refused to join the group.\nAs Ukabi's operations were now a nuisance and a threat to the Empire's interests, Maro Vizhen employed the services of an Imperial-aligned individual to disrupt his group's activities. Both his group's men and infrastructure were target of a massive attack, to which Ukabi retaliated with all-out war. The Empire's enforcer managed to invade Ukabi's base of operations and kill his four trusted lieutenants, only to find that Ukabi had Vizhen cornered in her own base. Before dealing with the diplomat, Ukabi was confronted and struck down by the enforcer.\nUkabi was a powerful warrior. His body had numerous cybernetic implants designed to enhance his survival and fighting capabilities. He was also a competent and ruthless leader, forcing the Empire to recognize him as a threat.\nUkabi and his gang are the main antagonists of a series of missions in Star Wars: The Old Republic, available to all Imperial classes.",
