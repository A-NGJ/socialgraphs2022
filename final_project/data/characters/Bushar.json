 "content": "Bushar was an Abednedo senator who served in the Galactic Senate of the New Republic. In the year 5 ABY, Bushar sat on the Committee for Imperial Reallocation and attended a meeting of the committee in the office of Chancellor Mon Mothma on the planet Chandrila. During the meeting, Mothma's attention drifted due to an old injury she had sustained, causing Senator Ashmin Ek to criticize her while Bushar and several other senators nodded in agreement. After Mothma's advisor Auxi Kray Korbin ended the meeting, Ek made a statement to Bushar reminding Mothma that he supported her opponent in the upcoming election, Tolwar Wartol.\nBushar first appeared in the 2017 novel Aftermath: Empire's End, which was written by Chuck Wendig.",
