 "content": "This Nikto seemed to frequent Moshi Bar, and was present when the Jedi Ahsoka Tano and Plo Koon visited the bar in search of information. At that time, the Nikto stood watching a Bith sitting near him. Soon after, however, the Nikto became bored, and drifted away toward a Quarren. By that time, Ahsoka had begun the Force to listen in on people's conversations in the hopes of picking up on the whereabouts of a dangerous bounty hunter. The first conversation she heard was between this Nikto and the Quarren he had recently encountered. The Quarren owned a business, and due to the war, it was doing poorly. All this was told to an extremely distracted Nikto, who turned slightly to let out a subtle grunt before the Quarren had finished his sentence. When a fight broke out between the Jedi and the patrons of the cantina, the Nikto, along with the other patrons, soon became distracted from credits thrown by one of the Jedi.",
