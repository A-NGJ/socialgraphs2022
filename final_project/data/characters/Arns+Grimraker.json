 "content": "Arns Grimraker was a cyborg salvage operator who visited the planet of Hoth in the wake of the Battle of Hoth. He and his crew flew Gun tugs and used a GR-75 medium transport, the Death Merchant, to haul their spoils. Grimraker traveled to Hoth shortly after the conclusion of the battleâ€”having previously had run-ins with the Rebel Alliance, he planned to destroy the remnants of Echo Base to send a message to any holdouts. However, while on Hoth he encountered Rebel pilot Wedge Antilles, who stole the Death Merchant after being left behind on the world in the chaos of the evacuation. Grimraker and his crew pursued, only to be annihilated by a force of Imperial TIE fighters patrolling around Hoth. Grimraker had a cybernetic left eye that greatly enhanced his vision, along with an artificial left hand that ended in a powerful claw.",
