 "content": "During the Clone Wars, this clone trooper served with Jedi General Eeth Koth and clone trooper captain CC-4142. He was among the members of Horn Company on board the Venator-class Star Destroyer Steadfast.\nThis trooper served under Captain Lock and General Eeth Koth as part of Horn Company. When Koth's cruiser was attacked and boarded, he instantly took action. He rushed towards the General's quarters and fired at the incoming super battle droid and droid commandos. This trooper was soon overwhelmed and rendered unconscious. However, when Koth was hit by a blaster bolt and about to be killed, the trooper gunned down the droid, saving Koth's life.\nMoments after blasting the droid, a Magnaguard electrocuted the Clone from behind, leaving Koth to attempt to fight off the advancing droids.",
