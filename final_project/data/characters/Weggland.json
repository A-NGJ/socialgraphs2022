 "content": "Weggland was a male Human lieutenant of the Galactic Republic during the time of the Cold War. In 3643 BBY he was stationed on Nar Shaddaa under commander Naughlen and was defending Republic Outpost Shylon from an Imperial attack led by General Kligton when the apprentice of Darth Baras arrived on the scene. The apprentice was systematically dismantling the power base of Sith Lord Rathari whom Kligton answered to and attacked his men when the General refused to switch sides. After Kligton and his soldiers were slain, Naughlen attempted to negotiate on behalf of himself and the garrison only to be slain by the Sith.",
