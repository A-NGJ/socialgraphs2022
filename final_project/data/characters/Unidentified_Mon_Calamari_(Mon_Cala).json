 "content": "A Mon Calamari individual with orange skin and eyes was present in Dac City on the planet of Mon Cala, wearing beige clothing. In 34 ABY, a Quarren sabotaged a shuttle that several members of the Resistance were planning on using to leave the planet. Upon witnessing the resulting explosion, the Mon Calamari cried out the names of two of its members, General Leia Organa and the Mon Calamari Aftab Ackbar, unable to believe their apparent deaths.\nHowever, the individual's statement of \"it can't be…\" was finished by the Jedi-in-training Rey with her saying \"it… it seems it can,\" as she had used the Force to levitate a number of crates, shielding herself and the Resistance members from the explosion.\nThe Mon Calamari appeared in the fourth issue of the Star Wars: Allegiance comic series, which was written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Luke Ross, and published by Marvel Comics on October 30, 2019. Prior to the comic's release, the Mon Calamari was revealed in a preview for the issue in a StarWars.com article published on October 23 of that year.",
