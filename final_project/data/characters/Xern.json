 "content": "Xern was a male Human slaver and pirate who worked for Rei'Kas in 19 ABY. He and a group of Rei'Kas' men approached Talon Karrde in the Ithor Loman on Dayark threating Talon and scaring off Entoo Nee. Xern was approached by one of Talon's crewers H'sishi, who scared him into fleeing after the others in his group were killed, though he threatened to see Talon again, just before he died. He was at the Battle of Exocron where he again confronted Talon, and he, much like the other pirates, were killed when the Aing-Tii monks intervened in the battle.",
