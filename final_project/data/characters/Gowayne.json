 "content": "Gowayne was a Chagrian male restaurant owner who owned a diner in a town on the planet Skuhl. When Imperial stormtroopers arrived in the town, they took over the diner. Gowayne tried to protest the loss of his restaurant to the Empire, and eventually he disappeared, without any trace of what happened to him.\nGowayne had mottled blue skin the same color as Skuhl's sky and the lethorns and forked black tongue characteristic of the Chagrian species.\nGowayne first appeared in the 2017 young adult novel Rebel Rising by Beth Revis and the book's audiobook version of the same name.",
