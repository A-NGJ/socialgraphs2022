 "content": "Yarian Kak was a male Cerean who worked as a trade advocate for the Metatheran Cartel during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In circa 31 BBY, Kak was present on the planet Cularin, where he was staying in the Chancellor's suite at the Reidi Artom Luxury Resort in the city Gadrin. After the Sullustan Salld Nrump obtained evidence of the existence of three data transmitters that the Cartel had covertly placed on Cularin, Nrump gave a datapad containing his findings to the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system. Kak contacted the agents on the behalf of the Cartel via a holographic recording contained within a messenger droid, stating that he was authorized to pay them  20,000 if they handed the datapad in to the Cartel and did not inform the media of its contents.\nThe agents accepted Kak's offered and they gave him the datapad, and he paid them 20,000 credits in return. Kak made a holorecording of the exchange that was later leaked to the media, causing slicers to hack into the agents' bank accounts and steal the 20,000 credits.\nYarian Kak was created by Morrie Mullins and Derrel Weaver, and appeared in Quarters, a role-playing adventure that formed part of the Blinking Eyes trilogy of the Living Force campaign. In the scenario, the players role-play as the Heroes of Cularin and they have the option of choosing whether or not they accept Kak's offer.",
