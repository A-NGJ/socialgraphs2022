 "content": "Gort/Vort was the nickname of a human male who worked for the Gray Syndicate. His actual name was apparently either Gort or Vort, but Merei Spanjaf could never remember which and thus came to think of him as \"Gort/Vort.\"\nServants of the Empire author Jason Fry states that the character's name might be Gort, might be Vort and might be neither, and that he feels \"kind of bad\" that he \"stuck Wookieepedia\" with such a dilemma.",
