 "content": "Javran Mu was the Mon Calamari manager of the Mos Espa hotel who lived during the Galactic Civil War. He became involved in the Battle of Mos Espa, when Tusken Raiders led by the Tusken King launched an attack on the city. Believing the hotel to be the safest place in town, he had the city's residents hole up inside inside the building until the battle came to an end.\nJavran Mu was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Javran Mu was added to the game as part of the \"Tusken Army\" Heroic Encounter, introduced with the release of the \"Chapter 7\" update, on November 1, 2007.",
