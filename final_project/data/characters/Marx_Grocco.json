 "content": "Marx Grocco was a Human male who lived in the the Corellian system during the Galactic Civil War. He worked for the Cluster World Relations agency.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Marx Grocco was the Director of Cluster World Relations, an official agency tasked to promote good relationships between Human and tribal species living on the worlds of the Corellian system. In 1 ABY, several Selonians of the Neetha Den on Talus were captured by pirates and kept as hostages in order to exploit the rest of the den. The situation generated anti-human sentiments among the Selonian population of Talus and hostile anti-human demonstrations erupted in the city of Nashal. Despite no act of violence against Humans was reported, the local police force and the Cluster World Relations issued a travel warning for Nashal. Via Corellia News Service, Marx Grocco explained that this preventive measure was meant to insure the public safety of Talusian human citizens and human travelers for any possible hostile encounters with non-human protestors. During those events, Grocco worked closely with the Corellian Security Force officers in an investigation into any unlicensed dealings with the tribal population of Talus.",
