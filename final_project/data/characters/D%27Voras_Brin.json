 "content": "D'Voras Brin was a Human male smuggler. He was know to work for both sides during the Galactic Civil War, willing to take work from either the Galactic Empire or the Alliance to Restore the Republic if the money was good. Brin wore black and red clothing, and hid his face with a hooded cloak. He had long, dark hair, and an unkempt beard and mustache. His weapon of choice was a heavily modified repeating blaster that had been pared down to the size of a blaster pistol, which was kept in a specially adapted holster. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel trooper Stannik Nhaa, considered contracting Brin to smuggle him off-world.",
