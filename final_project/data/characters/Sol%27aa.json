 "content": "Sol'aa was an orange-skinned, blue-eyed Twi'lek male who lived on the pastoral Outer Rim planet Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY. He lived in a room located on the north end of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave and occasionally played the gambling card game of pazaak. Sol'aa wore a white tunic, a blue undertunic, beige pants, gray gloves, brown boots, and a red belt. He understood Basic but spoke in Huttese.\nWhile at the Enclave, he met the former Sith Lord Revan, who was training as a Jedi after losing his memories. Sol'aa recognized Revan as a proficient pazaak player and offered a game. When Revan asked him about his identity, Sol'aa was dismissive, hoping to maintain his privacy. Despite the attitude, he was still open to playing pazaak with Revan and offered to sell some of his cards. Revan defeated Sol'aa at pazaak five times, and the Twi'lek instead wagered some extra cards as he had run out of credits.\nSol'aa appears as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. If the player attempts to play pazaak without a deck, Sol'aa will provide one. The conversation with him is optional and does not progress the plot of the game or change the player's alignment. If the player defeats Sol'aa at pazaak five times in a row, the latter starts wagering cards as opposed to credits. Alternatively, the player could lose to Sol'aa, prompting him to ask if the former wants to try again. Interactions with Sol'aa become unavailable after the player finds four of the five Rakatan Star Maps and boards the Leviathan, the flagship of Sith Admiral Saul Karath. While the player is aboard the Leviathan, the attack on Dantooine commences, and the player is unable to return to the planet.\nIn the Xbox version of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Sol'aa is green-skinned and gray-eyed. He wears a brown tunic with white accents, along with orange pants and white boots.",
