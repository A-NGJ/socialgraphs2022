 "content": "Gorna was a female Human smuggler operating during the Galactic War. In 3637 BBY she and her partner were smuggling bio-samples for a research freind of hers, when the ship was shot down by Nova Blades pirates over Rishi. Gorna herself was not aboard, but was unable to reach the wreckage and retrieve the samples because of the pirate threat. When an individual brought her the retrieved samples, Gorna offered to pay for the service.\nGorna appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
