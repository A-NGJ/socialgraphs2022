 "content": "Baarak Kalaim was a Klatooinian and the main mechanic for the The Shield's vehicles and starships. He was also secretly a Rebel Alliance operative.\nBaarak Kalaim worked for several outlaw techs before meeting Peert Ginzork. Ginzork hired Kalaim to be the main mechanic for The Shield around 0 BBY. He was also secretly a Rebel Alliance operative. He would spend his time tinkering with the engines and systems of the Shield's vehicles.\nKalaim was skilled but often absent-minded. He tended to talk to himself and was so unkempt that the other members of the Shield would avoid his quarters for fear of getting lost in the clutter.\nKalaim was skilled at all forms of repair, including blasters, computers, transports, droids, and starship weaponry.\nKalaim carried a blaster pistol, a pocket computer, a datapad, a comlink, a chronometer and various tools.\nBaarak Kalaim was designed by Rick Olshak for Cracken's Rebel Operatives, a supplement for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1994. He was illustrated by Mike Vilardi.",
