 "content": "Dyro Felldor was an Er'Kit male who acted as a representative of his species during the Galactic Civil War. When a slavery ring helmed by a group called the Blood Dawn rose on the planet Er'Kit, Felldor contacted the smuggler Saponza and his partner to aid his people in the fight against the Blood Dawn slavers. The Blood Dawn was eventually defeated, and Felldor relayed his thanks to Saponza's Gang. However, during the fight between the gang and the Blood Dawn, Felldor participated in a power struggle on his world, and had been manipulating both of the Galactic Civil War's primary participants—the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic—to serve his own purposes. Saponza eventually uncovered this information after Felldor refused to aid Saponza's gang after the defeat of the Blood Dawn.",
