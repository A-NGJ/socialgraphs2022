 "content": "Kronauer was a human male Imperial officer who served as Warrant Officer aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Kronauer encountered a stormtrooper, secretly the disguised rebel pilot Shara Bey, after she had been in one of the ship's transmission hub sending an encrypted transmission. Kronauer questioned Bey about what she had been doing in the hub, and not believing her story that she been carrying out routine maintenance, suggested she had been slacking off and taking a nap. When Bey disputed the claim, Kronauer replied that he didn't have to prove that she was, and then called attention to her damaged stormtrooper armor, adding there was no excuse for slovenliness. Before he departed, Kronauer told Bey to act like a trooper in the Emperor's army, and informed Bey he would be keeping an eye on her and threatened to make Bey regret it if he ever saw her in damaged armor again.",
