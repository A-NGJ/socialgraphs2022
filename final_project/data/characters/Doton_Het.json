 "content": "Doton Het was a male Twi'lek who won Ramana from a pazaak game from Harra. Harra had begged for him to give her back and found that the price was 2,000 credits. Eventually Harra would send Meetra Surik to free Ramana. Doton Het considered it a shame to lose her, as he enjoyed her dancing, thus challenging Surik to a one-on-one duel. When Het lost, Ramana was free to go with Surik.\nUnbeknownst to Surik and The Exchange, Doton Het was selling illegal items to customers without informing the Exchange. Harra however was fully aware of it though and believed that if the Exchange knew it would get Ramana back.\nDoton Het once played a pazaak match against Broon Ters.\nThe following are a list of ways to earn Ramana from Doton Het:",
