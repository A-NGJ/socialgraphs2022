 "content": "Dak Vox was a male Kajain'sa'Nikto smuggler who lived on Lok at the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Dak Vox had set up camp on the volcano Mount Chaolt, on the planet Lok. There, the smuggler collected chemicals generated by the volcano in order to produce valuable cationic chemical coagulant that could be sold on the black market.\nIn 1 ABY, a spacer working for the warlord Nym and his Lok Revenants traveled from the city known as Nym's Stronghold to Mount Chaolt in order to obtain cationic chemical coagulant from Dak Vox. The chemicals were requested by the water treatment technician Phor Cl-lan in order to repair the water treatment facility of the city. The spacer was sent to the volcano by Ralia Reeven, Nym's quartermaster, who was aware of Vox's business. As he owed Nym a favor, the smuggler could not refuse to provide chemicals. However, he asked the spacer to help him collect raw chemicals in exchange for the cationic chemical coagulant. The adventurer accepted the trade and then gathered chemicals on the slopes of the volcano. The spacer eventually returned to Nym's Stronghold with the cationic chemical coagulant that was used to resupply the mixing chamber of the water filtration system.\nDak Vox was a Non-Player Character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Dak Vox was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
