 "content": "Xant Flashheel was a male Nosaurian from Phemiss, on New Plympto. He was a rambunctious adolescent with a short temper, and had broken two horns in fights. Flashheel made a living as a swoopshaw driver in Phemiss, though he longed to leave New Plympto and visit the rest of the galaxy. Flashheel was a fan of Corellian underground music, and would often annoy his passengers by playing music loudly.",
