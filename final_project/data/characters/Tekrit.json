 "content": "Tekrit was a humanoid male who was in a bar on the moon Nar Shaddaa sometime between 3 ABY and 4 ABY.\nWhen Tekrit and his partner Nalita saw the bounty hunter Boba Fett enter the bar, they noticed that he had the biggest bounty on his head that they had ever seen. Tekrit tried to shoot to Fett with his blaster, but Fett saw his reflex in a glass and, with a quick move, he turned around and killed the humanoid. After killing him, Fett continued his conversation with the bartender as if nothing had happened.\nTekrit had blue skin and hair and red eyes. He wore a white tank top along with green trousers and grey boots. He also wore a strap over his shoulder, in which he had inserted a blaster pistol.\nTekrit first appeared in the comic War of the Bounty Hunters 1, published my Marvel Comics on June 2, 2021. The comic was written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Luke Ross and Neeraj Menon.",
