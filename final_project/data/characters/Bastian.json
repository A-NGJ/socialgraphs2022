 "content": "Bastian was a human male lieutenant and starfighter pilot of the Resistance during its conflict with the First Order. He participated in the assault on Starkiller Base as a member of Red Squadron, a group of T-70 X-wing starfighters. Flying as Red Four during the battle, Bastian was ordered by Poe Dameron to protect him and the other pilots. He later cheered along with the other surviving pilots after the assault turned out to be a success, and Starkiller Base was destroyed.\nBastian was a human male with dark skin, brown eyes, and black hair. A well admired and accomplished pilot, Bastian was an experienced professional and an intelligent man. He was brave and dedicated to the cause of freedom, and felt strongly against all that the First Order stood for.\nAs an X-wing pilot, he wore a red flight suit and a white flight helmet with red markings, alongside the unit insignia for Cobalt Squadron.\nBastian is portrayed by Tosin Cole in the 2015 Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abrams and written Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt. Cole auditioned for the role. During the shooting, the actor had to download a special app to get access to the script and had to learn his lines then and there, due to the secrecy of the production. He was also not allowed to take any script with him off-set.\nJason Fry, the author of the novelization of Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi originally desired to show the pilots who flew with Dameron in The Force Awakens on a mission to explain their absence from the film, but he realized that the plotline couldn't have a payoff.",
