 "content": "Tak was an Ewok who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor in Bright Tree Village. He was an eligible Ewok male and was sought after by many females in the village for his handsome fur. Around 3 ABY, Tak was old enough to attend the Shadow Night Festival. Although the young Ewok Latara believed that Tak was sure to ask her to attend the festival alongside him, Tak seemed unaware of Latara's intentions. He instead asked the older daughter of Chief Chirpa, Asha, to go to the festival with him, which she accepted.",
