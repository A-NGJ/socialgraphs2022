 "content": "Grond was a Human male member of the Alliance Military's 4th Squad, which was under the command of Corporal Jobin during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring the Battle of Hoth, 4th Squad was stationed at Echo Station 5-7. Grond noticed that the ion cannon near the South Entrance was under attack by snowtroopers and an All Terrain Scout Transport. He and Sora were ordered to flank the Imperials and attack them from the rear while Jobin, Roj, and another soldier attacked the Imperials head-on. They destroyed the AT-ST, although the stormtroopers had already entered the ion cannon and executed the Rebel personnel inside. They then retook the ion cannon. In the vicious close combat, Grond managed to send the transmission \"Imperial troops have entered the base,\" prompting Princess Leia to order the final evacuation of Hoth. He, along with the unidentified rebel, were shot in the struggle. Their sacrifice, however, allowed the squad to recapture the ion cannon and fire at an Imperial Star Destroyer, allowing Rebel transports to escape.\nDuring the Operation Hoth Defensive Event in the 2013 card game app Star Wars: Force Collection, his quote was given to Toryn Farr to introduce Raid Battles.",
