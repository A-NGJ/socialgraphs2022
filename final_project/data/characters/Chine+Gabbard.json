 "content": "Chine Gabbard was a native of Rehemsa, but worked as a botany researcher on Garqi.\nChine served as an executive on the board of Rehemsa Consumables. He threw lavish parties and was very popular among the native Garqians. He also did research on the hafa vines, a cash crop grown by Imperial order. Secretly, this research was to help the Galactic Empire in the development of a new bioweapon, as hafa pollen could be made to carry nerve agents.",
