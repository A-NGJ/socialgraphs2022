 "content": "Flash was a male Twi'lek treasure hunter who lived during the Cold War fought between the Galactic Republic, the reconstituted Sith Empire, and their proxies. Flash was a known associate of the female Twi'lek criminal Vette.\nTaunt, Vette, Plasmajack and Flash formed together a gang, whose last major job together was Cada Bliss, a rich Duros obsessed with Twi'lek culture. The gang stripped Bliss of almost everything valuable, but Bliss's revenge on them was hard. Mercenaries were set on their tail and Vette was captured and sold into slavery. Flash and the others tracked down Bliss in return, hoping for eventual payback. By the time Vette changed hands and ended up with a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras, Bliss has acquired a Twi'lek artifact called the Star of Kala'unn. Driven by her desire to take the artifact back, Vette convinced the Sith to confront Cada Bliss at the Nar Shaddaa spaceport, where she took the artifact from him. Vette later arranged a reunion with Flash and the others at the spaceport and the gang had a good time together, before Vette handed the Star of Kala'unn over to them. Impresses with Vette's accomplishments for the Twi'lek pride, the gang asked her back, though Vette preferred to stay with her new Sith master.\nFlash was first mentioned in the biography section of The Holonet, an online feature provided by the official website for the upcoming online video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic. Flash's first and only mention was as an associate of Vette's on that character's Holonet entry.",
