 "content": "Silus was a Force-sensitive Drovian. Strong in the Force, Silus competed in pit fights on an unknown Outer Rim world. His strength made him almost unbeatable, and his expressed goal was to make enough credits to get off the planet. Darth Sidious recognized his power and dispatched Darth Maul to deliver a message. When Sidious ordered Silus to kill Maul and take his place at the foot of the Dark Lord, Silus and Maul dueled. Despite his skills, and a dampening field that prevented Maul from using his lightsaber, Silus was defeated and beheaded by the Sith apprentice.",
