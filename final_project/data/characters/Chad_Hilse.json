 "content": "Chad Hilse was an Alderaanian ensign in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Dedicated to defeating the Galactic Empire, he was serving aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV when it was attacked and disabled by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. While protecting Princess Leia Organa and the captured Death Star plans she possessed, Hilse died when trying to defend the ship from the 501st Legion stormtrooper unit.\nChad Hilse was a Human male from the planet Alderaan. During the Galactic Civil War, he became a marine and volunteer trooper for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, attaining the rank of ensign and receiving training in both starship and ground combat. In 0 BBY, he was stationed aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV when Princess Leia Organa received a transmission from Rebel spies containing plans for the Death Star, a massive Imperial battlestation and superweapon.\nHilse was aboard the Tantive IV when it was attacked and disabled over Tatooine by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator, the flagship of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. After taking defensive positions along the corvette's corridors, Hilse and his fellow soldiers engaged the 501st Legion stormtrooper unit. He was among the first to die in the ensuing gunfight.\nChad Hilse typified the loyal Rebel volunteers dedicated to defeating the Empire. He had light skin, brown hair, and blue eyes.\nDuring his service on the Tantive IV, Chad Hilse wore the standard uniform for Alliance Fleet troopers. He was armed with a DH-17 blaster pistol. Hilse wore a cap as part of his uniform, and his equipment also included a bandolier and a scanner.\nChad Hilse appeared in the 1977 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. He was played by an uncredited extra, whose scenes were filmed in mid 1976 in the United Kingdom. The character had no lines and was not identified by the name Chad Hilse until 1995 with the release of Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game. His name and most of his backstory were featured on the \"Rebel trooper\" card in the Premiere Limited card set.",
