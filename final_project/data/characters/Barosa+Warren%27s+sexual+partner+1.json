 "content": "A Human woman of Coruscanti ancestry gave birth to at least one of four children fathered by the Morellian scout and outdoorsman Barosa Warren. Among the children were the males Tole Warren, Alton Lochner, and Roland Warren, and the female Danlea Lochner, all Morellianâ€“Human hybrids.\nWhile Alliance Intelligence Reports notes that Barosa Warren's children had Human mothers, it does not mention whether Warren was married to either woman. Similarly, the source mentions no birth years for the children, so, coupled with their mixed-species heritage, it is unclear whether Warren's sexual partner lived during the latter years of the Galactic Republic, during the Galactic Civil War, or both.",
