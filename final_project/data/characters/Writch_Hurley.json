Known as a genius but with inept communication skills, Writch had a deep appreciation for technology which showed in his work and social life. His eccentric nature was noted by his Imperial recruiter but was dismissed due to his aptitude for his work. This behavior is noted as call for attention from his boisterously known affections for Darth Acina.",
