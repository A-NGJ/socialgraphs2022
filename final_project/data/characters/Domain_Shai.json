 "content": "Domain Shai was a Domain of the Yuuzhan Vong Warrior caste. Members of the domain were known for their devotion and enjoyment of pain, extreme even by the standards of the Yuuzhan Vong. A particularly notable member of Domain Shai was Mongei Shai, who was part of the Yuuzhan Vong scout force that entered the galaxy. His death on the planet of Bimmiel in the exhibition was a source of pride for the Domain. The Shai were among the Domains that supported Domain Jamaane in their coup against Supreme Overlord Quoreal.\nAnother noteworthy member was Commander Shedao Shai, Mongei Shai's grandson, who led the Yuuzhan Vong's attack on Ithor. After Shedao's defeat and death, Domain Shai was dishonored. However, one Yuuzhan Vong who apprenticed under Domain Shai was still sent as an assassin to murder Elan after her supposed defection.\nDomain Shai first appeared in the 2000 novel The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught by Michael A. Stackpole.\nAccording Del Rey Editor at Large Shelly Shapiro in the Star Wars: New Jedi Order Round-Robin Interview, the concept of the Yuuzhan Vong's love of pain was originally confined to Domain Shai, but later authors misunderstood and applied it to the entire species.",
