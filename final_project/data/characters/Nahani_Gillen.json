 "content": "Nahani Gillen was a human female who served as senator for the world of Uyter in the New Republic Galactic Senate. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, she was present on the planet Hosnian Prime when it hosted the Senate. She was killed when the planet was destroyed along with the rest of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base. She had blonde hair and fair skin, and while on Hosnian Prime wore a robe of assembly.\nNahani Gillen first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. She was not identified in the film, but received a name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film.",
