 "content": "Zethe Raskin was a female Human politician.\nZethe Raskin was a self-centered and greedy politician, rising through the ranks of galactic government for over twenty years. She built contacts across the galaxy, and became highly influential, able to shift the course of policy with a simple smile.\nBeautiful and wealthy, Raskin took advantage of all the benefits that power could provide. She was known to use her looks to gain information on other powerful individuals and then destroy their careers. Raskin was also fluent in a number of galactic languages.\nZeth Reskin owned a Personal Luxury Yacht 3000, the Emerald Empress.\nIn the notes from Ultimate Adversaries, the authors suggested that Raskin might throw her complete support behind Emperor Palpatine and his New Order, or possibly function as a mole for the Rebel Alliance.",
