 "content": "Whorm Loathsom was a male Kerkoiden general for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. After winning several victories, he became a legend throughout the Core Worlds and the Inner Core. Despite believing enemies deserved respect, he regarded clone troopers as disposable tools and was willing to target non-combatants. During the Battle of Christophsis, he was a close confidant to Asajj Ventress. Prior to joining the Separatists, Loathsom had a long history of military service to the planetary defense forces of Kerkoidia. Later in the war, he was held as a prisoner at the Galactic Republic's military base on Coruscant.\nWhorm Loathsom was voiced by Corey Burton in the 2008 Star Wars: The Clone Wars film. Burton also provided the voice of Ziro Desilijic Tiure in the same film and later went to voice Count Dooku and Ziro in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series. The character of Loathsom was based on concept art for a Neimoidian baron trader that was drawn by illustrator and art director Doug Chiang during production for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.\nAccording to editor Dave Filoni and writer Henry Gilroy during an interview with TheForce.net, when they were asked if Whorm Loathsom was set to return in some episodes of the series, while both Gilroy and Filoni stated that there were plans to include Loathsom in the now non-canonical Star Wars: The Clone Wars comic book series which ultimately never materialized, they hinted that there was a possibility to bring back him in further seasons as well that the then-upcoming episode \"The Hidden Enemy\" was to feature Loathsom revealing the backstory of his plans with Asajj Ventress before The Clone Wars film. However, plans to bring back Loathsom were not fulfilled before the show's cancellation.",
