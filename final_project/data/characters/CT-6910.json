 "content": "CT-6910, nicknamed \"Razor,\" was a clone ARF trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. A soldier of Lightning Squadron, Razor served under Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds\" as well as Jedi Generals Mace Windu and Adi Gallia.\nAs a clone trooper, CT-6910 was created on the planet of Kamino. Bred from the genetic template of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett and cloned to fight and die for the Galactic Republic as a part of its massive Grand Army, CT-6910 would eventually receive the nickname of \"Razor.\" The army was first pressed into service when the Jedi engaged the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the planet Geonosis, which sparked the start of the galaxy-wide Clone Wars. One of Razor's commanding officers was Jedi General Adi Gallia, a member of the Jedi Order's High Council during the last years of the Republic Era.\nDuring the Ryloth Campaign, Razor served as an ARF trooper in the 91st Reconnaissance Corps's Lightning Squadron under Jedi General Mace Windu and Clone Commander CT-411 \"Ponds.\" Razor and the rest of Lightning Squadron assisted Windu in clearing a path for the AT-TEs when their forces came under attack by several AAT.\nRazor and another ARF trooper, \"Stak,\" volunteered to accompany Windu in locating Cham Syndulla and his freedom fighters' hideout. Razor, Stak, and Windu found the resistance after they took out a droid patrol, and were taken to their hideout.\nAfter Windu and Syndulla joined forces for the attack on Lessu, Razor took part in infiltrating Lessu with Windu and Stak. Together, they were able stow aboard one of the MTTs loaded with treasure across the plasma bridge. When droids scanned and discovered the three of them, Razor and Stak were then Force-pushed by Windu across the bridge as it was deactivated in an attempt to prevent Republic forces from crossing. Razor and Stak then went to the control room where they eliminated the battle droids and activated the bridge in time to allow both the freedom fighters' blurrgs and Lightning Squadron's AT-RTs to cross. They then defended the control against battle droids and a pair of BX-series droid commandos while Windu captured the Separatist leader, Emir Wat Tambor.\nAfter the battle, Razor would be given a commendation for valor of his role in the battle that freed Ryloth from Separatist occupation.\nRazor and the other members of Lightning Squadron accompanied General Windu and Commander Ponds to the planet Ridlay, where they investigated the communications blackout. They then came under attack by ghosts and later battle droids under Count Dooku.",
