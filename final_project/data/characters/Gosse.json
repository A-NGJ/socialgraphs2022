 "content": "Gosse was a Selonian female loyalist to the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War.\nDuring the Sith Empire's invasion on Corellia, Gosse was among the many aliens that joined the Corellian resistance in their conquest to defeat the Empire. However, she and CorSec Officer Cole Cantarus were captured by Empire and imprisoned in an Imperial-held CorSec station in the nearby Entertainment Plaza.\nAfter learning of this, General Aves sent a Republic hero to assault the facility and rescue both Gosse and Cantarus from their imprisonment. After her rescue, she delivered valuable information to the General and Republic forces about the other Selonians that were trapped and been held by Imperial forces and allowed the Republic hero to get inside the Coronet Shipping.",
