 "content": "Lima Starcourt was a female Human lawyer who spent most of her career on Coruscant. She later moved to Ostor and became one of the leaders of the Separatist group. When the Galactic Empire launched a military offensive to suppress the influence of the Separatists on Ostor, Starcourt and the other separatist leaders helped establish a defense strategy. This allowed the separatist general Atticus Farstar to almost completely wipe out a first wave of the empire. However, the defense did not stand up to a second wave of attacks. Starcourt and the other leaders were killed during the course of the battle.",
