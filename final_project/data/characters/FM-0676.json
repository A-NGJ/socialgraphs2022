 "content": "FM-0676 was a human female with dark eyes who was being trained by Captain Cardinal to be a First Order stormtrooper aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Absolution. On the day Cardinal was to attend a meeting on the Absolution with individuals such as Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux and Captain Phasma, FM-0676 along with FB-0007 and FE-1211 briefly spoke with Cardinal whilst he sat in the vessel's cafeteria. During the conversation FM-0676 just stared at Cardinal prompting the Captain to think that she was one to be watched as she was the one who was always watching. Before returning to his quarters, Cardinal told the group he would be checking their scores after his meeting.",
