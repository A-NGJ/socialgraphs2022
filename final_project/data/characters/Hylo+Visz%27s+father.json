 "content": "Hylo Visz's father was a male Mirialan droid designer living on Balmorra with his wife and daughter during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. The Mirialan was killed during the Empire's initial raid on the planet during the Battle of Balmorra. His wife and daughter made it off the world, however his wife died shortly after on Nar Shaddaa, leaving Hylo orphaned. His daughter would go on to become a galaxy-renowned smuggler. The day prior to his death, his landspeeder broke down, an event that led to Hylo's belief in the Invisible Law of the Universe.",
