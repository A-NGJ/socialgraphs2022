The first of these was the SkyCenter Galleria on Cloud City which was to be feature restaurants, shopping centers, holomazes, experience chambers and rides.\nHe had a wife and two daughters, a twelve-year-old and a five-year-old. Cojahn was known to have been a good supervisor, very attentive, hardworking and concerned for safety. When the Black Sun leader Czethros  tried to persuade Cojahn to work for him and place the casinos under Black Sun control, Cojahn refused. Czethros then murdered him, making it look like he had committed suicide by falling over a balcony.",
