When his workshop was taken by the Justicars, he couldn't prove ownership of the workshop without the deed, which was locked away deep inside the business. He tasked a Republic individual to travel to his workshop and in Justicar Territory and retrieve the deed.\nLuran appears in the mission \"Trouble in Deed\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
