 "content": "The Hux family was a human clan that achieved prominence—first, in the Galactic Civil War; and later, during the Cold War—in galactic history. Although their origins dated back to the twilight years of the Galactic Republic, the Huxes gradually amassed power and influence under the reign of the Galactic Empire through Brendol Hux, who served as Commandant of the Imperial Academy on Arkanis following his service in the Clone Wars. Having witnessed the fighting prowess of clone troopers and Jedi Knights during his time as a Republic officer, Brendol held Imperial stormtroopers in low regard and, therefore, believed that the ideal soldier was molded from birth. Brendol's views passed on to his bastard son Armitage Hux, who credited himself as the architect of the First Order's army of super-soldiers.\nIn the waning days of the Galactic Civil War, Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax took a special interest in the Hux family, believing Brendol and Armitage were critical to the Empire's future. As a result, the Huxes were spirited away to the Unknown Regions following the New Republic's decisive victory over the Empire. Using the Empire's rebirth as the First Order as a means to implement his methods, Brendol was responsible for the training of a new generation of stormtroopers—child conscripts who were trained from birth and programmed for absolute loyalty. After Brendol died, murdered by his son with the help of Captain Phasma, Armitage secured his future as a leading figure in the First Order. As the hermit state secretly prepared for war, Armitage gained the rank of general, served as a member of First Order High Command, and answered directly to Supreme Leader Snoke. In secret, Armitage coveted the throne of the Supreme Leader as he believed it was his fate to rule the galaxy.\nThe Huxes were a family of humans who served the Galactic Empire and its successor state, the First Order. Brendol Hux, an ambitious man who began his career as a military officer of the Galactic Republic, achieved prominence under the patronage of Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax. As Commandant of the Arkanis Academy, Brendol regarded Imperial stormtroopers inferior to the clone troopers that served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Therefore, Brendol founded an experimental progtam, the Commandant's Cadets, to turn cadets into elite super-soldiers. In order to achieve the same caliber as the clones, Brendol believed that the ideal trooper had to be trained from childhood. Using Brendol's training methods, Counselor Rax formed a group of child soldiers—conscripts from Jakku—but gave command of them to the Commandant's son, Armitage Hux, instead of Brendol.\nArmitage was born to a kitchen woman rather than his father's wife, Maratelle, making him Brendol's bastard son. Having gained favor with both Rax and Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, Armitage traveled with Brendol on an exodus to the galaxy's Unknown Regions in the aftermath of the Empire's downfall. Despite a solitary childhood, having neither friends nor the mother he never knew, Armitage was comforted by the history of the Galactic Empire as told to him through his father's perspective. While Brendol was proud of his service to the Empire, he disdained Armitage as a worthless, frail boy whom he would often subject to psychological and physical abuse. Brendol's belief that his son would amount to nothing fueled Armitage's ambition to achieve greatness, and he looked to the late Emperor Palpatine's rise to power as his inspiration.\nAs the First Order rose from the remnants of the Old Empire, Brendol and Armitage helped to create a new generation of stormtroopers modeled on the Huxes' vision of the perfect soldier. They also became generals, in turn, in the First Order military. By the latter years of the Cold War between the First Order and the New Republic, Armitage elected to commit patricide, having long regarded his father as an obstacle to his own ambitions for power.\nArmitage went on to become a powerful man in his own right, having joined the ranks of the First Order High Command. Additionally, he served as commander of the superweapon Starkiller Base and was part of a de facto triumvirate with Captain Phasma and the Force warrior Kylo Ren. Though a general, Armitage possessed greater authority than his military rank would indicate due to his direct access to Supreme Leader Snoke, and as such desired to be known as Grand Marshal. Yet despite his accomplishments, Armitage aspired to even greater heights and, believing it was his destiny to rule the galaxy, he secretly coveted Snoke's position as absolute ruler of the First Order. However, Ren also plotted to take the throne and, after assassinating his dark master, intimidated Hux into declaring Ren the new Supreme Leader.\nThough begrudgingly accepting the master of the Knights of Ren as the new Supreme Leader, Armitage's hatred for Ren continued until he secretly became an spy of the Resistance solely to ensure Ren's defeat. In 35 ABY, after aiding Finn, Poe Dameron and Chewbacca to escape from the Steadfast by killing three of his own stormtroopers, Armitage feigned that he had been injured by the rebels, but Allegiant General Enric Pryde saw through the young Hux's deception and blasted him on the spot for his act of treason.\nThe Hux family first appeared through Brendol Hux in the 2015 junior novella The Secret Academy, the last book in the Servants of the Empire series.",
