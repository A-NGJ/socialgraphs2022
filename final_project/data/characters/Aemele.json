 "content": "Aemele was a female Twi'lek thief who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nWhile on the planet Mustafar she managed to steal a Chu-Gon Dar cube from the Mon Calamari Doctor Ithes Olok, as well as his notebook on how to operate it, by seducing him. She went to meet with her contact on the planet Tatooine in the Mos Eisley Cantina where Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes were playing to give him the cube and receive her reward. Unfortunately for her, her contact had been captured by a smuggler who sat in his place. Not wanting to give up on the chance of being paid, she met with this smuggler who proceeded to steal the cube from her to deliver to his own contact in Coronet on Corellia",
