 "content": "Ha-ran was a male Eickarie, of the Family Mish-ra and the Clan Sha-kae. He was a prince of the Tribe Si-shae-ral and a member of the resistance on his homeworld against The Warlord and his Lakran mercenaries.\nHe encountered four members of the elite Stormtrooper Unit Aurek-Seven during the battle to liberate Kariek from the Warlord. He convinced the prisoners of The Warlord to unite, even though they were in different tribes. They had not heard of the United Tribes of Kariek before, and were still arguing and fighting.",
