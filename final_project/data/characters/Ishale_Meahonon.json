 "content": "Ishale Meahonon was a scout serving under Captain Pilia Tonth aboard the Far*Reach IV PQR Wanderer when it crashed on Isis.\nMeahonon chose to serve in the Imperial Survey Corps as it allowed her to see the stars without being bossed around.\nMeahonon would kill anyone she considered a threat. Although not paranoid, it is noted that Meahonon had few friends. Her incredible physical and mental stamina was something greatly regarded by her fellows.\nMeahonon was a tall woman, with long red hair reaching down to the small of her back, which she wore in a braid often tucked into the back of her coat.",
