 "content": "Erial was a purple-skinned, black-eyed, tame convor with purple and gray feathers. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the bird was offered for sale in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant as a pet, by the vendor droid 80-T5.\nErial first appeared as a purchasable companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010 and shut down in 2014. The convor was given free to Season Pass holders or lifetime members, but could be bought by others for 350 station cash, a premium in-game currency players had to buy with real money. Given that Erial's purchase was entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about whether it was bought.",
