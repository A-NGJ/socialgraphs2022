 "content": "Yur T'aug was a male Bothan who lived on the planet Coruscant during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. T'aug served as a police officer with the Coruscant Security Force  and, by 43 BBY, had achieved the rank of captain. T'aug was in charge of the investigations into the homicides of Senator Uta S'orn's son, Ren S'orn, and a petty thief and informant named Fligh. Both were the results of several killings on Coruscant in which the victims were drained of blood before being killed. Throughout the investigation, T'aug clashed with Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi on how the CSF was treating the cases.\nYur T'aug was a male Bothan who served as a police officer on the planet Coruscant. By 43 BBY, T'aug had achieved the rank of captain and worked as an inspector investigating cases such as homicide.\nIn 43 BBY, the murdered body of Ren S'orn, son of Senator Uta S'orn, was discovered on the planet Simpla-12. His body had been drained of blood in a manner similar to several cases on Coruscant. Because of that, T'aug was sent to investigate the murder. However, T'aug dropped the case at the request of Senator S'orn, Ren S'orn's mother. Ren was Force-sensitive but had left his training with the Jedi Order and had become a loner. Senator S'orn feared what T'aug may have discovered and simply wanted the matter to go away.\nHowever, six months later, T'aug was called to investigate the death of Fligh, who had been found in the Lane of All Worlds, an alleyway next to Coruscant's Senate Building. Fligh was a petty thief but also an informant for Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. T'aug discovered that Fligh's body had been drained of blood in a way similar to the earlier cases. Didi Oddo, a friend of Jinn's, informed the Jedi of Fligh's murder. When Jinn and his Padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, went to the crime scene and asked to see the body, T'aug consented. After some questioning by the Jedi, T'aug reluctantly revealed information about the case. He told the Jedi of the previous killings in which the bodies had been drained of blood. However, he did not inform them of the connection to Ren S'orn. As it later turned out, Fligh had faked his own death in order to escape to the planet Belasco after he had stolen Senator S'orn's datapad.\nJinn and Kenobi looked into the case further, discovering that T'aug had failed to properly investigate Ren's death. Kenobi confronted T'aug, who, though refusing to answer at first, admitted it had been at the Senator's request that the case had been dropped. The Jedi later discovered that Ren had been murdered by Jenna Zan Arbor, a scientist who had conducted experiments on Ren before killing him. Arbor had also been responsible for the other deaths in which the victims had been drained of blood.\nYur T'aug was a stockily built Bothan who had a flowing beard and glossy dark hair. Though T'aug was very professional in handling his job as a police officer, he was not especially happy with outside assistance from the Jedi. He resented that as police he was required to honor any requests by Jedi and to let them move in on his investigations. To a certain degree he was willing to work with them on a professional level and so outwardly accepted their suggestions, though internally he had a lack of interest in any of their tips or observations. T'aug especially disliked the Jedi questioning his motives or actions on other cases. When questioned by the Jedi on the handling of the Ren S'orn case, T'aug openly and rudely refused to cooperate, even though the CSF was mandated to do so. Only when Obi-Wan Kenobi reminded T'aug that both the police and the Jedi were on the side of justice did T'aug reluctantly tell the Jedi of the facts surrounding the S'orn case.\nYur T'aug first appeared in the young-readers novel Jedi Apprentice: The Deadly Hunter, written by Jude Watson and published on December 1, 2000. He also appeared in the followup novel, Jedi Apprentice: The Evil Experiment, also written by Watson and published on February 1, 2001.",
