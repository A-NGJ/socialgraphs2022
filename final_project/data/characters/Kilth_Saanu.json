 "content": "Kilth Saanu was a female Zabrak criminal who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. She was the leader of the gang of swoopers known as the Desert Banshees. After the Battle of Yavin, Saanu and the Desert Banshees proposed to join Jabba the Hutt's criminal organization. The swoopers were thus assigned to various missions so Jabba could evaluate whether they were worthy of joining his organization. This situation was later discovered by Lady Valarian, the leader of the Valarian Syndicate and main rival of Jabba. In 1 ABY, Lady Valarian therefore tasked a spacer with eliminating the Desert Banshees. The spacer eventually found Kilth Saanu and four of his thugs near Mos Eisley and killed them all in the ensuring firefight.\nKilth Saanu was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Kilth Saanu was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nBecause Kilth Saanu spawned under the generic \"bodyguard_zabrak_female\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of four possible depictions and would fluctuate after each server reset. Nevertheless, she systematically appeared as a Zabrak female.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Kilth Saanu was consequently removed from the game.",
