 "content": "Keriin Haslip was a Human female from Garos IV who served as a member of the Committee of Seven for Garosian Unification. She had a son, West, who married Nieka and had a child with her, Dair. She raised Dair after the death of his parents in 11 BBY.\nKeriin was an influential person on Garos IV, owner of mines on the planet. When the Galactic Empire established an official presence on Garos IV in 6 BBY, she was forced to sell her mines. This persuaded her to join the Garos resistance.\nWhen Jos Mayda, her grandson's best friend, was killed by two scout troopers, she introduced Dair to the resistance and convinced him to enter at the Imperial academy as a spy.",
