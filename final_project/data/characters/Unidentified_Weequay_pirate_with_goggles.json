 "content": "This Weequay pirate was a member of the Ohnaka Gang during the Clone Wars. This pirate helped to capture Count Dooku for Hondo Ohnaka, and was later present at a Weequay banquet. Much later, the pirate boarded a ship filled with Jedi Younglings with other pirates, however the pirates were pushed off the ship back to their own by Ahsoka Tano. The pirate held Tano at gunpoint a short time later. The pirate was at Hondo Ohnaka's base on Florrum while Ahsoka was being held there.\nLater in the war, Hondo Ohnaka's pirates were betrayed by many of their fellow criminals, and this pirate helped the other Ohnaka loyalists subdue the traitors and their leaders. The pirates ended up with much wealth and weaponry soon after.",
