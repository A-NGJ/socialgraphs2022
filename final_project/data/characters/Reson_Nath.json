 "content": "Reson Nath was a female Human who worked as a bounty hunter, operating during the Galactic Civil War. She was a member of House Paramexor.\nSome time during the war, Imperial Prefect Adar accused Nath of a variety of crimes and, after a trial, she was to be punished according to Guild rules. The trial was overseen by Moff Gorliz and presided over by Janq Paramexor. On learning that the trial involved a battle with Nath, Adar quickly dropped the charges. However, Gorliz, who had bet on the outcome with Paramexor, ordered Adar to participate regardless.",
