 "content": "Wag Too was a Lurmen healer and the son of Tee Watt Kaa, the elder of Maridun's Lurmen village, who lived during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Wag Too and other Lurmen lived in their village on Maridun. However, they were then visited by Jedi Knight Aayla Secura, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Commander Bly after they crash-landed. At first, his father, Tee Watt Kaa, refused to aid the Jedi until Tano told them that her master, Anakin Skywalker, was close to dying. Wag Too then went with Tano and Bly while Secura stayed with his father. When they arrived at the crash site, Wag Too assisted Tano, Bly, and Captain Rex in subduing a mastiff phalone. Wag Too then treated Skywalker. After a stretcher was built, Wag Too and the other then returned to the village, where he uses oil from a seed pod to heal his wounds.\nWag Too then helped the Jedi and the clones hide when a Separatist landing ship landed at the village. Wag Too and the Jedi then watched as battle droids under General Lok Durd searched the village for weapons or Republic contraband. After the Jedi and Durd left, Wag Too spoke with his father. He did not like his father allowing them to be harassed by the Separatists, despite the temporary peace.\nWag Too then sent one of his friends to follow the Jedi. When news came that the Separatists were returning, Wag Too suggested they should defend themselves. However, he respected his father's wishes. During the attack, Wag Too and the other villagers stood by until the battle droids were overwhelming the Jedi and clones. They then, despite Tee Watt Kaa's objection, assisted Tano in defeating the droids by knocking them down. After Durd was captured, Wag Too thanked the Jedi before they departed.",
