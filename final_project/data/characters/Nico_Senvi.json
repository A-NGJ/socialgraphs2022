 "content": "Nico Senvi was a male green Twi'lek. He was one of the swoop racers that Revan met in Anchorhead 3956 BBY and the local favorite. Nico was a skilled swoop pilot, ready to tackle the intergalactic circuit. He was offered a contract by Motta that would allow him to race as a pro, but declined since the Hutt would collect most of his winnings.\nThe problem regarding Nico's contract with Motta is a sidequest on Tatooine. The player can either help Nico get a better contract , or force him into taking the current contract . Because the canon storyline features a light-side Revan, it can be believed that Revan helped Nico get a better contract.",
