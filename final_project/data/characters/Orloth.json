 "content": "Orloth was a male Selkath who lived during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war he lived on his species' homeworld of Manaan, where he worked as a merchant in the Imperial Concourse of the Mercantile Plaza trading platform. While working he wore the blue and white robes of an adherent of the Order of Shasa, a Force-sensitive organization based on Manaan. Orloth's hairless skin was brown in color and his eyes were orange. When speaking to customers he spoke in a language other than Basic.\nOrloth was created as a character for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011, although he was not added to the game until update 2.9 in 2014. The update added the planet Manaan as a location to the game as a setting for the new \"Depths of Manaan\" flashpoint, which Orloth served as the Imperial flashpoint vendor for. He accepts only Manaan research data as payment for his inventory, a currency earned only by playing through the flashpoint.",
