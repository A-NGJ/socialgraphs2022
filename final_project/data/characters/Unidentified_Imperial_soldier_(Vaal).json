 "content": "This unidentified Imperial soldier was stationed at an Imperial outpost on Vaal, during the Galactic Civil War.\nStationed on Vaal for several months, he and the others grew lazy, and preferred to slack instead of working. Along with Sergeant Reybn, he told Privitt that nobody would care if he didn't do what he was stationed on the planet to do. He died shortly after the Battle of Yavin, when Darth Vader entered the outpost with a pack of aggressive hyenax, who killed the entire crew after the Sith Lord had left on the outpost's only shuttle.",
