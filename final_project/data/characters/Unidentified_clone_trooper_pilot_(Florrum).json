 "content": "A clone trooper pilot served during the Mission to Florrum, and perished during the mission.\nThe pilot was operating a Nu-class attack shuttle alongside another pilot, Mack. The purpose of the mission was simple; since it was confirmed by Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker that Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, was in the custody of Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang, Galactic Republic Senator Kharrus and Representative Jar Jar Binks would land on the planet Florrum, take Dooku back to Coruscant for trial while the pirates would get one million credits worth of spice. Unfortunately, a revolting pirate named Turk Falso wanted all the spice for himself. To do this, he used a Flarestar-class Weequay ship to shoot down the shuttle. Although the unidentified pilot and Mack easily avoided the laser fire, Jar Jar Binks accidentally pressed a button on the shuttle. Designed to bring pilot's down via an elevated chair for quick access to the cockpit. The pilot suddenly found himself up out of the cockpit and near Jar Jar. After briefly chatting with the representative, the trooper ordered him back into his seat. Afterward, the pilot was back in the cockpit, but it would all be for naught; Turk Falso launched homing missiles, and neither Mack nor the pilot could shake the projectiles and both missiles forced the craft down. The unidentified pilot, Mack, and Senator Kharrus died in the crash.",
