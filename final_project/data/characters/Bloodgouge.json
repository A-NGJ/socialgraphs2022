He would be killed however in his cave, next to which laid one of the Raiders' camp's holiest shrines, by an Imperial strike force when he began marshaling his people for an attack on Outpost Rennar.\nAround this time, the chieftain's herald was provoked by the Imperial forces' destruction of his Herald's Totem beside his hut during the intruding party's search for a Tusken-distilled lethal poison's antidote, which was held within the shrine by the chieftain's cave, and was lured out to be likewise brought down before the cliff that sported Bloodgouge's cave. The Herald of Bloodgouge's mask was claimed as a trophy, and his demise brought the Tusken Raider clan to disarray.",
