 "content": "Hako Armado, an elderly male Rodian, was known as a skilled dramatist operating during the early years of the New Republic. Few realized that this was but a pretense, and that Hako was in fact a deadly assassin.\nWith the spikes atop his head going gray with age, Armado kept his identity as an assassin secret from all but a few beings. Fewer still knew that many of Hako's supposed \"kills\" were in fact fakesâ€”arranged by the targets themselves to escape trouble.",
