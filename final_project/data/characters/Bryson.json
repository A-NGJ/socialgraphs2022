 "content": "Bryson was a Human male major of the Imperial Diplomatic Service who served the Sith Empire during the Cold War. Bryson worked with Vector Hyllus and Anora at one point in his career.\nBryson first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, but the mission that he would have introduced on the planet Dromund Kaas was cut from the game before release. Bryson would have sent players to speak with Captain Guyvar, who they needed to convince to send one of his Chevin workers to the Diplomatic Service in order to impress visiting Chevin diplomats.",
