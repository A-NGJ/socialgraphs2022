 "content": "Dartas Pytin was a Human male ace pilot for the Car'das during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn his early career, Dartas Pytin was a pilot in the Corellian Security Force. After the Battle of Yavin, he was a well-trained pilot for the Car'das based on Tansarii Point Station, along with Serissu, Laetin A'shera and Aleas Rans'ery. In 1 ABY, he oversaw all Car'das operations in the Scarlet Dawn quadrant of the Bright Jewel system.\nDuring the Battle of Tansarii Point Station between Car'das and Black Sun forces, Dartas Pytin tasked his pilots to eliminate several Black Sun spies in order to prevent the spread of the Black Envy computer virus. Pytin later led the final assault against the Black Sun strongholds known as the Salient Trinity. He first ordered his pilots to attack the Dual Moons, eliminate Black Sun pilots and kill Lieutenant Commanders Chaen and Ondara. Dartas Pytin's pilots finally assaulted the Darkveil Eclipse and his defenses led by Lieutenant Commander Rilis. The pilots were successful and thus annihilated the main Black Sun hubs in the Bright Jewel system. Pytin's pilots later joined other Car'das pilots to eliminate remaining Black Sun forces in the area, formally ending the Battle of Tansarii Point Station.\nDartas Pytin appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Dartas Pytin was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
