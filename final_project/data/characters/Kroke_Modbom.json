 "content": "Kroke Modbom was a male Gungan who worked for the Naboo known as Veermok. Kroke and Veermok opposed the Monarchy of Naboo, and sought evidence of corruption within its ranks. In 36 BBY, Kroke went to Port Landien in search of a cache of evidence, whereupon he was chased by Lieutenant Quarsh Panaka and his partner Bialy of the Royal Naboo Security Force through the Port Landien Perfumery. Kroke was arrested, and was later turned over to Sate Pestage, who claimed the Gungan was guilty of murder and treason against the Republic. He was taken offworld and executed under Sate's orders.\nKroke's first name is sometimes misspelled \"Korke\".",
