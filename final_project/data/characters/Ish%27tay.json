 "content": "Ish'tay was an Ithorian ecologist and Force Adept with ocher-colored skin. He was deeply spiritual, though not orthodox by Ithorian standards. He worshiped an aspect of the Force, had several metal rings on his pierced neck, dressed only in a simple cloak, and carried a gnarled staff. He traveled to the devastated world of Caamas, hoping to inspect the alien jungle growing in the southern hemisphere, but soon sensed a disturbing spiritual presence on the planet. With the help of local adventurers, Ish'tay discovered a massive Ithorian Herdship buried beneath the forest.\nIsh'tay's unconventional understanding of the Force nevertheless allowed him to sense others' emotional states and heal the wounds of others.",
