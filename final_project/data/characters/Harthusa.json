 "content": "Harthusa was a male Devaronian slaver based on the Imperial world of Deysum III. Although cunning, Harthusa's cowardice was evident. He resided within a luxurious domed apartment where he entertained females of all races. He owned the yacht known as Harthusa's Pride. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Wookiee Kentara came into Harthusa's possession, and the Devaronian sold him at auction to Quintarus Returyl, a representative of the Spice Mines of Kessel. Unknown to Harthusa was the fact that Kentara was a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic; an Alliance team on Deysum III witnessed the sale and broke the Wookiee out of Harthusa's slave camp the same night, making their escape in the Harthusa's Pride.",
