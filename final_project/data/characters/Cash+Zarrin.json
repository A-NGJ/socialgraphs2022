 "content": "Cash Zarrin was a male Human member of the Second Battalion of the Republic Medical Corps living during the Galactic War. More commonly known as the \"Protectors\", this humanitarian division served alongside the Republic Military on battlefields across the galaxy, conducting rescue, reconnaissance, and evacuation operations to help civilians who were caught in the crossfire. In 3638 BBY Cash Zarrin along with the rest of the Battalion was deployed on the disaster-stricken planet of Makeb, where Zarrin and Tefani worked on evacuating civilians from the groundquake-hit Talaos City, asking a Republic agent on the planet to clear out the InterStellar Regulators to allow the Protectors to do their job.\nCash Zarrin appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion, released on April 9, 2013.",
