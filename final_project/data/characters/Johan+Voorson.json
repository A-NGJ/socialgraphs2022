 "content": "Johan Voorson was a Human male technician who was the husband of Nell Voorson, the father of Shannon Voorson, and the uncle of Deen Voorson. During the Galactic Civil War, he worked at the Kuat Freight Port after his brother died in an alleged accident after repairing ships for the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nWhen his nephew, Deen, arrived home and asked Nell to allow him and the Rebel Alliance to steal a power generator, she refused his request, though Johan stated he was willing to help. However, Johan ultimately refused to help when reminded of what became of his brother. His daughter defected to the Alliance at the age of nine.",
