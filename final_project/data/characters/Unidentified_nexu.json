 "content": "While at the Petranaki arena, this nexu was used as the means to execute Senator Padmé Amidala\nWhen Anakin Skywalker, Padmé Amidala, and Obi-Wan Kenobi were captured by Count Dooku on Geonosis, this nexu was selected along with an acklay and a reek to be the animals used to execute the three. One of the Geonosian guards attempted to direct it with a stun rod, but it, upon being shocked, pounced the guard, evidentially being fed up with the shock, and mauled him to death, before other Geonosians recovered the guard's corpse. The three manage to escape from their chains and fight back against the creatures. The nexu wounded Senator Amidala  but she was able to knock the nexu off the perch she is on and onto the ground. The impact of the fall temporarily knocked it out, although it regained consciousness, and was about to strike again when Skywalker, riding his newly tamed reek, head-butted into the nexu and killed it.",
