 "content": "Nilo was a male Rodisar, from the planet Rodis, who served as a general during the planet's winter wars. Despite having little tactical skill, Nilo climbed the military ranks of his homeworld through bribes and pay offs, eventually gaining notoriety for his many \"war exploits,\" which in fact were due more towards his command staff than Nilo himself.\nA Rodisar general during the winter wars on Rodis, Nilo's success was short lived as during the Wars when he and most of his command staff were kidnapped by Zygerrian Slavers, but many of his followers died trying to defend their general. The slavers sold him to Rattataki war barons, whom the former impressed with the tales of his military exploits. Nilo only climbed the ranks of a corrupt military by bribing Rodis politicians, most of the combat experience came from his commanding staff. Though appearing to be a strong and capable brawler, in 22 BBY Nilo saw his first real combat in the Cauldron gladiator pit, in which he faced Asajj Ventress and didn't come out alive.\nNilo first appeared as an unnamed background character in the sixth chapter of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated television series. Nilo's name and backstory were later expanded upon when he receIved his own Databank entry on StarWars.com.\nNilo's appearance was based on unused concept drawings—done by the artist Nilo Rodis-Jamero—of the Gamorrean guards during the production of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.",
