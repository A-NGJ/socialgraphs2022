 "content": "Cedarik Killesa was a Human male from the planet of Alderaan who served as a member of House Killesa during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nCedarik Killesa was a Human male who opposed the Sith Empire and its backing of House Thul, whom he viewed as a puppet. He sent his troops against House Thul on multiple fronts as a diversionary tactic, a ruse which Jorad Sindarus Thul fell for. While House Thul's forces were spread thin, Killesa led a sizeable force through the siege tunnel that connected the lands of House Thul and House Killesa, a remnant from a more peaceful time. With information gathered on the battlefield, an Imperial allied individual took a set of thermite charges to collapse the tunnel before it was too late.\nWhen confronted, Killesa was furious at the Empire's involvement, which he saw as House Thul's weakness, as well as treason. Even so, he demanded that the individual engage him in an honorable duel instead of detonating the thermite. The spacer refused and detonated the explosives, killing Killesa and his men.\nCedarik Killesa is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is voiced by Troy Hall.",
