 "content": "Asha was a female Human who lived on the world of Naboo. When Obi-Wan Kenobi met her, he sensed something special about her, indicating a possible Force-sensitivity.\nAsha was one of many of Queen Amidala's palace servants at the time of the Naboo Crisis by the Trade Federation. She was being pursued by battle droids in the palace kitchen when the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was trying to rescue the Queen before the Trade Federation could take her to Camp Four arrived and saved her. Kenobi sensed something special about her, indicating a possible Force sensitivity. In return, Asha helped Kenobi reach the throne room as she was able to crack into the security doors. However, Kenobi had arrived too late to save the Queen at the throne room. Nevertheless, he and his Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn were able to rescue her as she was escorted to Camp 4.\nDuring the Queen's absence, Asha became one of the leaders of the Naboo Resistance. When the Queen decided to reclaim Naboo, Asha met up with Kenobi again. She assigned the Jedi to free Naboo starfighter's pilots who were held hostage by the Trade Federation's battle droids; Kenobi escorted the pilots to join up with Asha and the Resistance, who were fighting battle droids. She then sent Kenobi to destroy the turbolaser cannon so that the pilots could take off safely.\nAsha was voiced by Grey DeLisle in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Obi-Wan.",
