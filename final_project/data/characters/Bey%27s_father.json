 "content": "Bey's father was a human male Corellian tramp freighter captain and the father of Bey.\nBey's father met the Nagai scout Krai H'voc, who had been sent to Corellia as a precursor to the Nagai invasion of the galaxy but instead settled there; the two fell in love and wed. Years later, in 36 BBY, H'voc gave birth to their son, Bey, the first known human/Nagai hybrid. When her superiors learned of her marriage, they ordered H'voc to end the relationship and continue her mission scouting the galaxy elsewhere. H'voc followed orders, departing her family with little explanation.\nBey's father hated H'voc for abandoning the family, and he would weep over holos of her when drunk, decrying her leaving; over time, drink and spice ruined him. He took out his anger on Bey, whose mixed heritage became more obvious as he grew up and served as a reminder to his father of his departed wife.\nBey's father served as a lesson to Bey, who became determined to never descend into the anger and mental disturbance that plagued the elder man, which led the boy to seek out friendships like that he found with the orphan boy Han Solo. Years later, after leaving the Corellian Security Force, Bey would seek out his mother using clues his father had left behind.",
