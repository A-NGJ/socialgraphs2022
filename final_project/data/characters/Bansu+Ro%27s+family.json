 "content": "During the time of the Galactic Empire, the family of the human male Bansu Ro, who was born on the planet Lothal, sided with rebels against the Empire. Ro resultantly split from his family and joined the Imperial Academy on the planet Carida. Although the allegiance of his estranged family initially put a stain on his career prospects in the Empire, Ro was taken in by the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing around 4 ABY. Four months after the fall of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, he was an ex–Imperial present on the planet Freerock.\nThe family first appeared in the form of Bansu Ro in the fourth issue of the Star Wars: TIE Fighter comic series, written by Jody Houser, penciled by Rogê Antônio and Ig Guara, and published by Marvel Comics on July 17, 2019. Bansu Ro's family was then established to exist in Victory's Price, the final novel in Alexander Freed's Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy which was published in 2021.",
