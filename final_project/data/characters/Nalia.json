 "content": "Nalia was a female Human citizen of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul living during the war against Zakuul. For three years she was a neighbor to a man named Arron until she was arrested as the enemy of Zakuul. During the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin in 3630 BBY Nalia was put in a shock collar with other Zakuulan rebels, who were to be executed by the Empress Vaylin. Arron treated Nalia as a slave and despite her pleas refused to acknowledge that he even knew her from before. Vaylin's execution of rebels was interrupted by the arrival of first the Alliance Commander and then former Emperor Arcann. In an effort to kill them both, Vaylin ordered the Eternal Fleet to bomb the Palace into rubble, regardless of her supporters still inside.\nNalia appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during \"Chapter VI: The Dragon's Maw\".",
