 "content": "Rorq was a male Mawan, and a native of Mawan.\nIn the years leading up to the Clone Wars, Rorq worked on fuel transport tunnels for his homeworld's capital city of Naatan.\nFollowing the planet's disastrous civil war, he worked as a \"subrat\" tunnel worker in Naatan's underground infrastructure.\nIn 25 BBY, he acted as a guide, alongside his friend Swanny Mull, for Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Yaddle during their mission to Mawan.\nRorq had long, gleaming dark hair and a short but muscular build.\nRorq is erroneously described as 'white-haired' in his character entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, confusing him with his fellow tunnel worker Swanny Mull, whose 'white hair' description therein is correct.",
