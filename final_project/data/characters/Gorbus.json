 "content": "Gorbus was a Hutt male active during the Cold War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. By 3643 BBY, Gorbus possessed six of a set of seven sculptures of a rare striped gizka, a species of reptile.\nAround that year, an individual affiliated with one of the Cold War's two rival factions found the seventh striped gizka statue. They sent a companion to learn what Gorbus would pay to complete his set, persuading him to pay double what the statue was worth.\nGorbus was mentioned in the Crew Skill mission \"Completing the Collection\" in the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
