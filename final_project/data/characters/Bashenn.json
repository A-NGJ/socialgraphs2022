 "content": "Bashenn was a male Rutian Twi'lek Pilgrim and security chief who lived on Tython illegally during the Cold War between the resurgent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic.\nA Twi'lek male, Bashenn was one of many Pilgrims who followed Matriarch Kolovish to the planet Tython in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War and the enslavement of Ryloth by the Hutt Cartels. Assisting in the establishment of Kalikori village, Bashenn appointed to the position of guard captain after the healer Vederiat Ayon relieved Odumis Mer of his position on account of his mental instability. He was not friendly to the Jedi Order as he resented them for abandoning the pilgrims to fend for themselves against the Flesh Raiders.\nDuring the Cold War, Bashenn was preparing Kalikori village for the Festival of Awakening when he was approached by a Jedi Padawan who asked about the whereabouts of Nalen Raloch, the establishment's champion guardian. Bashenn was very resistant to the idea of helping a Jedi, and was already busy enough with the festivities, but the Padawan convinced him that it was in his best interest to divulge Raloch's location. Bashenn gave in and told the Padawan of a camp that Raloch kept within Flesh Raider territory where he assumed their protector might be.",
