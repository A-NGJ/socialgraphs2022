 "content": "Jell Spiel was a Human male from Bespin who served the Bespin Wing Guard as a cloud car pilot during the Galactic Civil War. He co-piloted one of two Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud cars near Cloud City in 3 ABY when the Millennium Falcon arrived there. One Cloud Car fired warning shots at the freighter before escorting it to a landing platform. Spiel's experience as a pilot of cloud car prototypes proved very useful during the evacuation of Bespin.\nThis character was most prominently seen as an action figure in Kenner's The Empire Strikes Back toy line, though the pilots can be briefly glimpsed inside the Cloud Cars in the film. Close up photos of the Cloud Car prop used in the film shows two different pilots inside the pods. The action figure package photo appears to be one of those pilots. His name and personal history was finally revealed in the Rogues Gallery feature of Star Wars Insider 148. The second pilot, distinguished by a mustache, was the basis for a later action figure by Hasbro. He was later named Duncan Hikmat.\nThe figures' full uniforms were based on concept art by Nilo Rodis-Jamero, which was later used to represent Rebel Alliance officer Kem Monnon in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe.",
