 "content": "Gwig was a young male Ewok who lived on the forest moon of Endor. He came of age and received his hood—together with Malani and another wokling—at the Festival of Hoods. He was also amongst a group of young Ewoks and woklings to whom Chirpa told the story of Logray, Morag and the Sunstar.\nGwig was a background character with no spoken lines in the Ewoks television series. His name appears only on two of Nelvana's animation model cels, one of which shows him wearing a hood and the other a bandana. Both versions of Gwig are present in the crowd of young Ewoks in \"Sunstar vs. Shadowstone.\"\nHe was one of six 8-inch plush woklings made by Kenner.",
