 "content": "Mitaka was a professor and a Jedi in hiding during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Mitaka lived on a remote part of a lifeless planet surrounded by droids, including his assistant, T0-B1. While hiding, Mitaka conducted research, attempting to generate life on that barren world.\nMitaka's luck ran out when T0-B1 boarded a skyhopper in the professor's compound basement, and inadvertently advertised into space the existence of Jedi on that planet. That information was picked up by a Star Destroyer boarded by an Inquisitor, who tracked down the professor. Mitaka hid his droids T0-B1 and C03, along with his lightsaber. His last words to T0-B1 saying \"I'm one with the Force; the Force is with me.\"\nBy the end of the encounter, Mitaka was nowhere to be seen, and had most of his compound and droids destroyed. Later, T0-B1 found Mitaka's grave, and when the Inquisitor came back, Mitaka's spirit saw how T0-B1 grew and managed to complete his research. He also told him that T0-B1 is ready for the battle and acknowledged the robot as his Padawan. He knighted T0-B1 as a Jedi Knight and wished that the Force be with him, providing the little droid confidence to decisively defeat his foe. After the battle, T0-B1, alongside C03, took it upon himself to continue Mitaka's research and help planets harbor life.\nMitaka appeared in the Star Wars: Visions short film \"T0-B1.\" He was voiced by Tsutomu Isobe in the original Japanese audio and by Kyle Chandler in the English dub.",
