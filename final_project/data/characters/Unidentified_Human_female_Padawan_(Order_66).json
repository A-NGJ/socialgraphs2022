 "content": "This individual was a Human female Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order during the time when the Clone Wars erupted across galaxy. When Order 66 was executed by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, she was with two other padawans that were able to escape the Jedi Temple's destruction caused by the 501st Legion led by Darth Vader. While attempting to escape Coruscant, she and her companions were crossing the Shinarcan Bridge Extension, but their chances to flee proved futile as they were suddenly caught by the Grand Army of the Republic and Coruscant Security Force personnel, leading to a terrible shootout.",
