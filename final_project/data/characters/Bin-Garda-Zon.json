 "content": "Bin-Garda-Zon was a male Cerean with a crippled left hand that had two missing fingers. He was also a leader of a band of raiders on the planet Cerea around 88 BBY. At one point, it was said that he had one hundred wives, and twenty sons, an impressive accomplishment on a world where the female to male birth ratio was about 20 to 1.\nBin-Garda-Zon's particular gang terrorized the area around a village by stealing food livestock, and stealing male children. The village was home of future Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. When Ki-Adi-Mundi left to begin his Jedi training, he vowed to return one day to rid the countryside of the raiders, and particularly, of Bin. Twenty years later, when Mundi returned to his home, he sought after the raider chief. To his surprise, once he found the raiders, Ki discovered that not only had Bin been deposed by female raider chief, but blinded and forced to work as a slave. Ki was imprisoned and Bin, hearing the laughter from his former henchmen, planned to slit his throat. But the Jedi broke free and the rushing raiders thought he meant to harm Bin. After Mundi defeated the new chief, Bin made a second attempt so he could regain his former title but the Jedi simply deflected his dagger. After disbanding the raider village, Mundi left, leaving the decrepit old man to his fate.",
