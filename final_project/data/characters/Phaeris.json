 "content": "Phaeris was a Human female Corellian who worked as a smuggler during the Galactic War. She was one of the contacts of the Havoc Squad during the Battle of Corellia, leading a group of volunteer smugglers aiding the Republic. However, the port where her group's ships were docked was captured by Imperials, forcing Havoc Squad to clear the landing zone.\nPhaeris later sent a message to commander of Havoc, expressing her thanks for saving the Lucky Lancer against General Elin Garza's recommendations to destroy it.",
