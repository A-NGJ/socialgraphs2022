 "content": "Shettora was a Hutt who was a crime lord in 0 ABY. By that year, Shettora controlled a criminal faction that operated out of the Core Worlds' planet Brentaal IV, in which a fellow Hutt by the name of Puullo served as a lieutenant. Shettora's organization controlled the black market on Brentaal IV, and sold decent goods at only slightly marked up prices.\nShettora was first mentioned in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the Far Orbit's adventures. The book did not specify which gender personality Shettora had.",
