 "content": "Seezelslak was an Azumel male bartender who ran Seezelslak's Cantina on the planet Batuu. While he did not have many customers, Seezelslak had a penchant for storytelling, including a favorite involving the local Jedi temple, Yoda and a Padawan named Ady Sun'Zee. In 34 ABY he had an encounter with Mubo and his former repairman, who later became Seezeslak's new drink item hunter out in the Batuu Wilds after his old one was lost. Seezelslak also had a problem with porgs that were rehabilitated in his cantina by Chewbacca of the Millennium Falcon.\nSeezelslak was portrayed by Bobby Moynihan in the virtual reality experience Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge.",
