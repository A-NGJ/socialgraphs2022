 "content": "Illiv Orfa was a Twi'lek Dark Jedi on Mustafar in 1 ABY. During her time on Mustafar, she stole a serpent-like crystal from a sleeping Mustafarian. The Mustafarian, Ikt, hired a spacer to hunt her down and retrieve his crystal. While the spacer was investigating where the Mustafarian had been camped, the spacer stumbled upon a strange altar where Orfa appeared. The spacer attempted to bargain with Illiv for the crystal. However, Orfa became angry and attacked the spacer with her lightsaber, but she was outmatched and was killed in the duel.\nIlliv Orfa appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
