 "content": "Savina was a female Tarasin who lived on the planet of Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nSavina served the Wyrd, a group of Tarasin Force witches, as a soldier. She was the personal bodyguard of the Wyrd sister Torunin.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Savina was present on Cularin in the central hut of the village where the Zhadorii irstat lived, when she and Torunin were attacked by the heroes of Cularin.\nIn Hunting the Wyrd the identity of the Wyrd sister and bodyguard that the player characters fight in the central hut varies, depending on player level. Higher-level players fight Torunin and Savina, but Mid-Level players fight Naelora and Kosaa instead, while Upper-Level players face Baeshana and Veshin. It is also possible for the players to avoid the hut, so even Higher-Level players don't have to fight Torunin and Savina.",
