 "content": "Sk'kot Burrid was a Human male corporal who served in Bria Tharen's Red Hand Squadron of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nBurrid was stationed aboard the Marauder-class corvette Retribution when the Rebels attacked the Ylesian slave ship Helot's Shackle outbound to Kessel. Originally, he was slated to board the Helot's Shackle with the rest of his squad; having developed a mild fever, however, Burrid was ordered off the mission despite his own assurances that he felt fit for duty. Later, he participated in the Battle of Ylesia as part of a squad assaulting Colony One.\nSk'kot Burrid was killed along with the rest of Red Hand Squadron on Toprawa while attempting to transmit the Death Star plans to Princess Leia Organa.",
