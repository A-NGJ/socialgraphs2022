 "content": "Gibsun Robalto was a Human male who served as a member of the COMPNOR SAGroup troop during the Galactic Civil War. He was the head of his group, with more badges than anybody in his platoon. He was particularly admired for having turned his uncle into the authorities after overhearing him making anti-Empire comments.\nGib was qualifying for the highest rank in the youth organization by hiking across the Core so that he witnessed firsthand the widespread power and might of the Empire. His travel voucher allowed him free passage on any non-military Imperial vessel.\nRobalto was a fine looking young man with sandy-blonde hair and dead gray eyes. He was a natural leader and a capable athlete and very friendly to and supportive of his compatriots.",
