 "content": "Shass was a female Neimoidian businesswoman who was born during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 32 BBY, she joined the Trade Federation and initially planned to rise through the ranks of the organization. However, when the Federation blockaded the planet Naboo, and Shass realized that the Trade Federation was corrupt, she refused to progress any further within the organization. In 17 BBY, she later settled in the city Zarra on the planet Cato Neimoidia and by the time of the early years of the Galactic Empire, she had established the business Zarran Imports and Exports.",
