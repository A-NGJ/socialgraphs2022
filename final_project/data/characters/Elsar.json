 "content": "Elsar was a Human male citizen of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3642 BBY he was stationed in Aurek Base on Hoth, where he sold item modifications.\nElsar appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Modification Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Hoth. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Elsar was removed from the game along with the rest of the Modification Commendations Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
