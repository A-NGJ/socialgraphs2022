 "content": "\"Black-Eye\" Cahoon was a male Clantaani criminal who was an associate of the Tatooine gang leader Longo Two-Guns. During his time on Tatooine, he was believed to have played a role in the kidnapping of some of Jabba the Hutt's Twi'lek dancing girls. As a result, he was captured by Jango Fett who claimed the bounty from Jabba.\nThe bounty is 5,000 credits alive and 2,500 credits dead. It is up to the players decision on which way.",
