 "content": "This male Yuuzhan Vong agent lived under identity of a Human male named \"Dulac\" in the planet of Artorias, preparing for his species' invasion of the galaxy. He wore an ooglith masquer which allowed him to assume the shape of a Human.\nHe happened upon the technician Sparky who was fixing a comm interlink at the Artorias communications center and noted the latter's frustration at being unable to repair the interlink. When questioned why he was here, \"Dulac\" commented that he did not like the idea of Artorias being cut off from the rest of the galaxy. Sparky accepted his offer of help on the promise that he told everyone else that Sparky was the one who fixed the damage.\n\"Dulac\" then proceeded to apparently fix the interlink and also received a distress signal from the crew of the exploration ship Pythea. The Chiss female explorer Panha warned him of the danger of an approaching Yuuzhan Vong fleet. \"Dulac\" told them that their signal had been received but did not tell Sparky about the message. Sparky was then told by \"Dulac\" that his attempts had also failed.\nUnaware of Panha's distress signal and the impending Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Sparky commented that there was nothing wrong with his planet being left in the dark. However, \"Dulac\" then removed his form-concealing ooglith masquer; revealing himself to be a hidden Yuuzhan Vong advance agent.\nA friend of the king Caled Galfridian, \"Dulac\" helped him in attempting to repel the Yuuzhan Vong in the Battle of Artorias along with the other members of the Artorias resistance. Later he was seemingly captured by the Yuuzhan Vong and put into the Embrace of Pain. After some amount of time in imprisonment an explosion shook the torture chambers where \"Dulac\" was held, freeing him. He found an opening caused by an explosion and left through there. He was than grabbed by the resistance members dressed in seaweed. They took \"Dulac\" into the water where they had their hidden base and took off their disguises. \"Dulac\" then saw his King Caled Galfridian alive and leading the resistance. Around that time Finn Galfridian learned of Dulac's true nature from an information broker on Nar Shaddaa.\nFinn, together with Jacen and Jaina Solo, raced back to Artorias to warn his father, but when they arrived it already was too late, \"Dulac\" had revealed himself to Caled and had attacked him. During their fight Dulac praised the King for his Yuuzhan Vong-like spirit. \"Dulac\" realized the fight was over when Finn's droid, Prowl, arrived at the scene and shot him. However, \"Dulac\" had one final card to play: a plaeryin bol. He successfully spat the venom contained in the bol at the king's face, but was cut in half by Jacen and Jaina Solo shortly after.",
