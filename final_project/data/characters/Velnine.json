 "content": "Velnine was a male Zabrak Sith Lord of the Resurgent Sith Empire during the Cold War and the apprentice of Darth Nurin.\nDuring the Cold War, he was aboard Vaiken Spacedock in the Supplies sector where he would instruct Imperial spacers to meet with his master Darth Nurin aboard the Ziost Shadow.\nVelnine first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic and served as a flashpoint courier for Imperial players to direct them to the flashpoint Kaon Under Siege. According to the text files for the game, Velnine was originally a droid named VN-99, but was changed to a Sith by the time of the game's release.",
