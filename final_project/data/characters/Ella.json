 "content": "Ella was a human stormtrooper in the 501st Legion, the Sith Lord Darth Vader's personal legion. The trooper served in a fireteam alongside fellow stormtroopers Riccarn, Tig, Xander and Deena Lorn. The fireteam members made it through many missions together, and were thus assigned with a squad aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor.\nAboard the Super Star Destroyer, Ella spent some nights with their squadmates, aside from trooper FS-451, sat in a corner in the destroyer's mess hall, notably sipping alcohol illegally distilled by Xander and wondering why 451 was still only a stormtrooper. In 3 ABY, when the Executor traveled to the tibanna mining colony Cloud City, Ella, Riccarn and Xander remained stationed on the vessel while Lorn, Tig and FS-451 went down to the city with Vader.\nElla was mentioned in the short story \"The Witness,\" which was written by Adam Christopher and released as part of the 2020 short story collection From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back.",
