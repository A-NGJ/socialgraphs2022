 "content": "Jolka was a male Zabrak mechanic who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, he worked at Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. In 1 ABY, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO and a spacer arrived on the station aboard the Millennium Falcon. The Wookiee Chewbacca then requested Jolka to fix the droid R2-D2 that had been damaged during a firefight in an Imperial space station. Unfortunately, the mechanic was missing a power converter. As the Wookiee was getting impatient, the Zabrak became very nervous. He therefore tasked the spacer to destroy some malfunctioning droids on the lower level of Tansarii Point Station to get a power converter. The spacer eventually returned with an intact power converter and Jolka was able to fix R2-D2.\nJolka appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jolka was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
