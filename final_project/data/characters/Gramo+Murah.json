 "content": "Gramo Murah was a Human male member of the Ragtag gang who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nGramo Murah was the leader of a small group of Ragtags based in a bunker in the Nomad Mountains. After the Battle of Yavin, Murah's goons entered into a violent conflict with another criminal organization, the Meatlumps, fanatical anti-technology thugs. The Ragtags eventually forced Strilath Farles' band of Meatlumps to relocate from Corellia to the planet Talus.\nIn 1 ABY, the Corellia Times reporter Vani Korr tasked a spacer to deal with Strilath Farles in exchange for information about the Meatlumps. The Meatlump lieutenant wanted his revenge on the Ragtags and the adventurer accepted to rid him of Gramo Murah and his gang. The spacer attacked the Ragtag bunker in the mountains and finally killed Gramo Murah and some of the Ragtag goons. The spacer also destroyed their stash of stolen goods. In the end, the death of Gramo Murah was meaningless since Strilath Farles eventually refused to share any information.\nGramo Murah appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Gramo Murah was added to the game with the update dubbed \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King,\" released on June 19, 2008.\nThis non-player character  was known in the game as Gramo Murah or Mramo Gurah, depending of the Combat Level  of the player. If the player performed the quest \"The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 4\" during the leveling of their character , the NPC would be named Gramo Murah. If the player performed the quest after the end of the game , the NPC would be named Mramo Gurah. Multiple story elements indicated that the quest was intended to be achieved at CL 65.",
