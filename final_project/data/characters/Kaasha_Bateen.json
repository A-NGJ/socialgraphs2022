 "content": "Kaasha Bateen was a Rutian Twi'lek female master strategist in the Free Ryloth Movement who was good with a blaster. While serving with the Free Ryloth Movement, she participated in the Pasa Novo campaign, where she met the smuggler Lando Calrissian, as well as during the Battle on Baltro. Bateen and Calrissian developed a romantic relationship. At some point, she was in a crew with Han Solo and Calrissian. They went on a mission to stop Fyzen Gor from activating the Phylanx Redux Transmitter, which succeeded when Gor died at Solo's hands. Bateen was known to be good at the game saigok, which she described as \"badass dejarik,\" playing the game with Calrissian and Chewbacca onboard the ZV-9 freighter Vermillion. Between the birth of Calrissian's daughter Kadara in 13 ABY and Kadara's disappearance in 15 ABY, Bateen traveled with Lando and Kadara to the planet Adelphi where they spent a few days in the town of Cirimalk.",
