 "content": "Bilman Dowd was a representative of the Bounty Hunters' Guild and had worked there for many years.\nAn elderly, thin man, Dowd was the Guild representative present at Devaron when Boba Fett delivered Kardue'sai'Malloc to the authorities, collecting the massive five-million credit bounty. Dowd detracted the Guild's customary 10% handling fee and asked Fett what he would do next. When the bounty hunter informed him that he would be carrying out a promise to the imminently doomed Kardue'sai'Malloc, Dowd once again repeated that Fett was \"a strange one,\" an observation he had frequently made over the course of their decade-long business relationship.",
