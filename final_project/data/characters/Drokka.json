 "content": "Drokka was a Rodian who worked as a bounty hunter. He also worked for Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc., as a sales rep.\nHe was sent by Merr-Sonn to represent the company at the Cularin Trade Show during the Clone Wars and he exhibited the G-8 power blaster there. He pointed out to customers the tactical advantages that the rifle had and claim that it was a more accurate ranged weapon than similar rifles being exhibited at the show by rival companies.\nDrokka later cooperated with the bounty hunters Shiana Trist and K1-1R to collect Contract AA-23, a bounty that had been placed on the Heroes of Cularin.",
