 "content": "Wollivan was a male Blarina who lived approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. He worked as an interstellar scout and hyperspace trailblazer; he sold valuable astrogation data and scavenged trinkets to smugglers and traders for a living, though he would sometimes gamble his products away. Wollivan often spent time in a castle that belonged to the pirate Maz Kanata.\nWhen Han Solo entered the castle of Maz Kanata, the pirate took notice of this and called out to him. Wondering at whom Kanata was shouting, Wollivan spun around in his seat to catch a glimpse of Solo. Shortly after Solo's arrival, Wollivan and several other patrons of Maz Kanata's castle rushed outside in order to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.\nWollivan had pink skin and black eyes. He wore a mottled, brown Blarina vac-suit and used other species' inability to distinguish individual Blarinas to his advantage; he often claimed to be a different member of his large family to avoid trouble.\nWhile he appeared briefly in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, Wollivan was first revealed in an exclusive Vanity Fair article published seven months before the film's release in 2015. Wollivan was not identified in this article, nor was his name revealed during his brief appearance onscreen. Instead, he was given his name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo.\nWollivan was portrayed by Warwick Davis, who has played several other characters in the Star Wars saga, including Wicket W. Warrick, Wald, and Weazel. Like the other Star Wars characters portrayed by Warwick, his name starts with W.",
