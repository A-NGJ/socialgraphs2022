 "content": "Princess Wilena was a Force-sensitive female Human who was a member of the Lamont Dynasty of Daimar and the grand-daughter of King Mitar, the ruler of the planet Daimar. She born to Mitar's daughter Princess Erra and her father died during one of the Trade Conflicts between Daimar and neighboring worlds shortly after Wilena's birth, while her mother was killed during the Clone Wars.\nFollowing the formation of the Galactic Empire, when Wilena was 15 years old, Daimar refused to submit to the new regime and the Empire blockaded the planet. Mitar realized that Daimar would eventually have to surrender, so he arranged for Wilena, Senator Alet Komain and a small group of individuals that he didn't want to be captured by the Empire to leave Daimar in the starship Wasaka and make contact with Mitar's son Prince Torrin, who led an off-world resistance group. The Wasaka made it past the blockade and transported Wilena and the rest of the passengers to the planet Byrsym, where they made contact with Torrin's organization. They then flew aboard the Wasaka to Dantooine, where they rendezvoused with Torrin and his group.",
