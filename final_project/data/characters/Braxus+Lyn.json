 "content": "Braxus Lyn was a Force-sensitive female Clawdite, who worked as a mercenary during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Lyn carried out a number of assignments for the Confederacy of Independent Systems and following their occupation of the planet Tirahnn, she was sent to work there as a spy and keep the world's wealthly elite under control.\nDuring the Battle of Tirahnn, Zolghast, the commander of all CIS forces on Tirahnn was captured by the Galactic Republic, so Lyn was sent to free him and transport him away from the battlezone. The Republic forces were preparing to move Zolghast to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Solidarity, so Lyn disguised herself as the Barabel Jedi Master Ezar Elasra and freed him. She then took him to a landing pad and began preparing a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle so that they could leave Tirahnn. However, before they could leave, they were attacked by a group of Republic agents who were attempting to recapture Zolghast.",
