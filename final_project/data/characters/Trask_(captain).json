 "content": "Trask was a male Human Captain in the Republic Navy who was killed by the Separatist warship Starcrusher around 21 BBY.\nThe Human male Captain Trask was an officer in the Republic Navy around 21 BBY. In that year, he led a naval task force of Venator-class Star Destroyers against a CIS munitions factory located on an asteroid deep within enemy space.\nAs the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi sabotaged the factory's force field, the task force was assaulted by the Separatist battleship Starcrusher. Trask ordered shields to be raised, but this didn't stop the Starcrusher from destroying his ship and task force, killing the captain and his crew.",
