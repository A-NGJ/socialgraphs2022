 "content": "Attark was a brown skinned and black eyed Hoover male owned by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt as a pet. Surprisingly, he had a very high intelligence and was talented at weapon repair work. The Hoover lived in Jabba's Palace on the desert planet Tatooine, where he did repairs on weapons and gadgets for the Hutt.\nHe was weak-bodied and looked harmless, but at night, Attark often stalked the palace and snuck up on sleeping victims to suck their blood, using his nose trunk to slither through clothing or around blankets. This was a dangerous habit, as the palace was mainly populated with criminals that would not take kindly to being attacked in the dark.\nAttark was created as a puppet for the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, with a prototype model also being made; however, the character is not visible in the final film. In the current Star Wars canon, he was first mentioned in the 2015 reference book Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know.",
