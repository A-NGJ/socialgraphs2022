 "content": "Lalutin was a Selkath male administrator and emissary of the Galactic Republic on the forest planet Arbra during the High Republic Era.\nHe was once enrolled as a cadet at the Carida Military Academy, where he was a senior cadet while future Nihil Tempest Runnei Lourna Dee was a first-year. He abused the young Twi'lek, demanding she perform menial tasks for him in the name of his seniority despite her superior aptitude at starfighter maintenance. Dee attacked him with a servo driver he had demanded she give him, nearly killing the Selkath cadet. Lalutin's friend Wilson then engaged Dee in hand-to-hand combat until the Academy's Captain Reese arrived. Dee proceeded to escape aboard a stolen fighter.\nLalutin's skull was fractured by his injuries, and he had to spend four months in the infirmary.\nYears later, Lalutin served in the Republic Correctional Alliance as an administrator on Arbra, a world that had been attacked by Nihil. Lourna Dee, then a prisoner aboard the prison ship Restitution, was tasked with rebuilding Arbra's main settlement as part of a work party of prisoners. After Lourna became trashed under a load lifter at the local logging station, Lalutin confronted her and revealed that he knew her true identity as Lourna Dee.\nLalutin called the Starlight Beacon to turn Dee in for a bounty of 5,000 credits and glory when he was shot by Tasia, a Nihil working for Tempest Runner Pan Eyta. Eyta wanted to kill Lourna himself.\nLalutin appeared in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast.",
