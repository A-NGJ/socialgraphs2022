 "content": "Andrik Keller was an Er'Kit male Nihil marauder. He held the rank of Strike in the Tempest of Tempest Runner Lourna Dee, serving aboard the starship Lourna Dee. He was promoted to Storm by Dee during the Battle of Galov after the Nihil, outgunned and outnumbered by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order forces, were forced to evacuate the starship. Keller managed to escape, while numerous other Nihil were captured; Dee herself was among those taken to Starlight Beacon by the Jedi, who, believing that she had died in the battle, were unaware of her identity.\nAfter learning from another escaped Nihil that the survivors had been taken, Keller went to Sran in the Ash Worlds, hoping to recruit a crew in order to stage a rescue. On Sran, Keller unknowingly encountered former Tempest Runner Pan Eyta, who sought revenge on Dee for betraying him. Having consumed several drinks on Sran, Keller recounted the events of the battle, revealing Dee's status. Eyta subsequently killed Keller, departing in search of Dee.\nAndrik Keller was voiced by Jonathan Davis in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott.",
