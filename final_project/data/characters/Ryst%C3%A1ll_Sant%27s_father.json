 "content": "A Theelin male was the biological partner of a Human female, and the pair gave birth to a half-Human and half-Theelin, Rystáll Sant. They abandoned their daughter, who was raised by a pair of Ortolan musicians.\nRystáll Sant's father was first mentioned in 1997's Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition, a supplement for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. Notably the StarWars.com Databank entry would mention that he was Human and his partner was an \"unknown alien.\" As that is the only source that mentions the father as a Human and the mother as an alien, this article, along with all linking articles, treats that as an error, and assumes the father was a Theelin and the mother was a Human.",
