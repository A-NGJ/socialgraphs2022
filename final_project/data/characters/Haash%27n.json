 "content": "Major Haash'n was a Mon Calamari male from the Outer Rim world of Dac. After his homeworld was subjugated by the Galactic Empire, he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, motivated by a dream to pilot Star Cruisers. In 4 ABY, he was stationed aboard the flagship of the Alliance Fleet, the MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser Home One. He stood behind several Alliance leaders as they gave a briefing on how the Rebels would attempt to destroy the Empire's second Death Star superweapon. Haash'n went on to serve on Home One in the battle, which resulted in an Alliance victory.\nThe Mon Calamari male Haash'n hailed from the Outer Rim planet Dac. After Dac's subjugation by the Galactic Empire, he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nIn 4 ABY, Haash'n was aboard the MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser Home One, flagship of the Alliance Fleet, serving as a major. He was among several Mon Calamari and Humans who stood behind Supreme Commander Mon Mothma, Admiral Gial Ackbar, and General Crix Madine of the Alliance High Command as they briefed an audience of Rebels on how they would go about destroying the Empire's second Death Star. After the briefing, Home One traveled to the Endor system, and Haash'n served aboard the Star Cruiser in the ensuing battle. The Alliance subsequently won the engagement, destroying the Death Star and killing Emperor Palpatine. Haash'n's name meant nimble.\nHaash'n had orange skin. He had a dream of piloting a starship, as well as a specific, personal goal of piloting Star Cruisers, the latter of which was his motivation to join the Alliance.\nHaash'n was a master engineer, being known for his skills in the field.\nHaash'n wore a beige Mon Calamari Crewman uniform.\nHaash'n first appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, where the character was portrayed by a female extra. The scenes on Home One were filmed throughout the week of Tuesday, February 16, 1982. The scenes were lengthy to film due to complications with the lighting associated with the hologram of the Death Star.\nHaash'n was first identified on a card in the Death Star II Limited expansion pack for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in 2000. An image of Haash'n and other Mon Calamari from Return of the Jedi was reused to depict the Mon Calamari Regiment's troops in the 1998 video game Star Wars: Rebellion, albeit with the background swapped. However, no connection was made between those Mon Calamari and Haash'n.",
