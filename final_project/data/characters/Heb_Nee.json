 "content": "Heb Nee was a Gungan male warrior who lived on Naboo's moon of Rori during the Galactic Civil War. He was a member of the Rorgungans, a group of extremist Gungans who violently opposed Boss Rugor Nass's support of Naboo's human population during the Invasion of Naboo and rejected any alliance between humans and Gungans. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Lieutenant Heb Nee served under Captain Hassk, the Rorgungan commander, in the Gungan Swamp Town, along with fellow Lieutenant Ori.\nLieutenant Heb Nee was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Heb Nee was added to the game with the \"Publish 1\" update, released on August 3, 2003.",
