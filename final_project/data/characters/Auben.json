 "content": "Auben was a black market dealer on Korriban who lived inside the abandoned Sith Monastery.\nAuben was a well-known supplier of illegal goods on Korriban when Anakin Skywalker and Ferus Olin purchased a pair of handwarmers from her while on a mission as an excuse to obtain information about Granta Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor from her outside of Dreshdae. As they were about to make a deal with her they were attacked by a Commerce Guild army. Auben led Anakin and Ferus into the Sith Academy in exchange for them having saved her life under the impression that the army would not enter the ruins.\nWhen the army did not stop she led the Jedi deeper into the ruins and into an ancient hangar which was being used by a mysterious Sith Lord as a temporary base. A small group of B2 super battle droids were being stored in the hangar, when Auben, Ferus and Anakin entered they attacked. During the fight between the Jedi and the droids, Auben tried to sneak aboard a ship docked in the hangar to steal several valuable items she had intended to collect earlier. When she was discovered by the Sith Lord in the hangar, he stopped her heart, instantly killing her.\nAuben was a paranoid woman who disliked sharing information with her customers and waited until they had spent enough time in the area for her to get a close look at them. She was motivated by credits, though she was willing to help others if they had helped her first.",
