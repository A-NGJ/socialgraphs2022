 "content": "A middle-aged Human female customs official greeted Meetra Surik upon her landing at Kaas City on Dromund Kaas. When she confronted Surik about the Jedi's ship not being registered, Surik claimed she wanted to stay off the record. The official accepted, under the condition that Surik pay an extra fee, at which point Surik asked to convert her funds—a diamond—to the local currency. The official argued that she had a strict payment up-front policy, but Surik employed a mind trick, causing the official to agree to make an exception, as they were both Human.\nWhen Surik asked who would give her a fair price for her diamonds, the official suggested Larvit.",
