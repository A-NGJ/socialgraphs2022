 "content": "Spero was a male Ho'Din who lived in the Southern Underground on Coruscant. His life and that of his family was saved by Leia Organa prior to 3.5 ABY. He was a Master Gardener, and created a strain of yellow fungus used over the galaxy, and also grew feather trees in his shop. He later helped Leia find the entrance to Xizor's Palace. Later Lando Calrissian and Luke Skywalker would come to him for aid, only to find him tied up in his shop. They were attacked by men from Black Sun and were rescued by Dash Rendar, though Spero was left behind with an apology.",
