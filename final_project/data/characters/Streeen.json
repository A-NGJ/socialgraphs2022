 "content": "Streeen and Luuuke Skywalker created a time machine after the Lost Tribe of Sith emergence. The pair used this to transport the Army they gathered together to the galaxy during the Clone Wars period, when they fought Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Grand Army of the Republic.\nStreen was mentioned in \"An Apology\", a short story by Timothy Zahn that was released on April 1, 2012 as an April Fool's Day joke. In the context of the story, any appearance of Luke Skywalker following the Fate of the Jedi series would be Luuuke. Further, the article in which An Apology was published announced facetiously that Luuuke would star in upcoming novels such as Star Wars: The Clone Wars 2: Luuuke. The novel serial, The Clone Wars 2 or Son of Clone Wars, was to continue releasing titles for perpetuity, and Luuuke's adventure with Streeen would have taken place in the seventeenth volume of the tale.",
