 "content": "A human female served as sparring partner to Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan when the latter skipped a lesson she was supposed to be taking on language study. The pair fought with polearms atop one of Alderaan's many mountains, and the woman was surprised when Organa managed to knock her down. The princess joked that she had been able to do because she had eaten plenty of ruica while growing up, causing her partner to laugh. Organa's adoptive father Bail Organa then arrived in an airspeeder and scolded his daughter for missing class before taking her away and leaving the woman atop the mountain.\nWhile fighting, the sparring partner wore a white outfit with metal gauntlets. She had red hair and light skin.\nThe unnamed sparring partner first appeared in a flashback in the comic book Princess Leia 2, which was released on March 18, 2015 as part of the Star Wars: Princess Leia comic series written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Terry Dodson.",
