 "content": "Major Charger was a mercenary who commanded his own unit, Charger's Irregulars. A small but effective unit, the Irregulars specialized in brushfire wars and hot spot conflicts. In combat, Charger was a tightly wound commander, shouting orders and commands. Out of combat, Charger was soft-spoken and polite. While the Irregulars were exclusively Human, Charger had no qualms about working with aliens although he found it easier to command beings of his own species.",
