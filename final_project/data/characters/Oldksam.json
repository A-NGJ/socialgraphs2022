 "content": "Oldksam was a male Rodian who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Oldksam resided in Mos Eisley with his fianc√©e, Taibela. They were acquainted with the thugs Untas and Sleash.\nIn 1 ABY, Untas was indebted to the crime boss Faeto. When Faeto placed a death mark on him, Oldksam, Sleash and Untas went into hiding. Taibela stayed in Mos Eisley, where she was questioned by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter convinced her to reveal where Oldksam was hiding. The bounty hunter then tracked Oldksam, who was hiding in the Krayt Cult Cave to elude Faeto. When the bounty hunter told him that the death mark only targeted Untas, Oldksam agreed with giving Sleash's location. The bounty hunter later found Sleash, then Untas, and finally killed the latter.\nOldksam was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Oldksam was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
