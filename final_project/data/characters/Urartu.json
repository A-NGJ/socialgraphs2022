 "content": "Urartu was a Wookiee bouncer who worked at the Contumely Club, enforcing the Club's policies of allowing no Humans or droids on the premises. Urartu made use of a small creature who translated for the Wookiee. Urartu stopped Roark Garnet from entering the Club at some point during the Galactic Civil War, despite Garnet having business with a person inside the establishment.\nIn real life, Urartu was a kingdom in eastern Anatolia , existing from before 1000 BC until 585 BC. It might appear in the Bible as Ararat.",
