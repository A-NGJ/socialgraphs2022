 "content": "Ono-Mi was a male Voss Commando living on Voss during the Galactic War. Around 3640 BBY he was assisting Commando Biddeck-Va at his base in the Gormak Lands. When the Emperor's Wrath sought the audience with Biddeck-Va, Ono-Mi explained that he was on a mission against the Gormak chieftains that could last for months. Only if the chieftains were all defeated, could Biddeck-Va return from his duty. The Sith had no time to wait and simply slaughtered all Gormak all alone, to the surprise of both Ono-Mi and Biddeck-Va. Ono-Mi was then slaughtered when the Wrath stole Biddeck-Va's trinket.",
