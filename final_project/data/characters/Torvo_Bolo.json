 "content": "Torvo Bolo was an Aqualish male who operated an outfitter's store in Myrra, capital city of the planet Akiva. He would always appear gruff when interacting with customers; however, when ever he traded goods with the parents of Norra Wexley and her sister Esmelle, he would always slip the two children candy-swirl sticks. At some point prior to Wexley leaving Akiva to fight in the Galactic Civil War, Bolo's store was burned down and rumor spread that the arsonist responsible was someone from the black market looking to make a profit by reducing the availability of certain items.\nTorvo Bolo was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
