 "content": "Russo Berlihat was an analytical programmer who studied at the finest Technical Academy in the Core Worlds. After a stint working under a Moff on Eriadu, Berlihat was contracted to work for Moff Bandor on Questal. Despite being paid well, Bandor ordered Berlihat to feed Lonchant, a Protean who lived in his Game Chambers. While carrying out the Moff's orders, Berlihat was killed by the Protean after belatedly realizing he was the Proteans meal, not the tray of vegetables he was carrying.",
