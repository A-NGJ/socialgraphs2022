 "content": "Ullesin was a male Human who served as a captain in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. In 3640 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Ilum while a battle that took place there. During the battle, Ullesin sold equipment from a stall in the Republic base camp. While at the stall, he wore a brown and purple uniform including a helmet, and carried a blaster pistol. Ullesin had brown eyes and fair skin.\nUllesin appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as an end-game gear vendor for Republic players on Ilum, though his actual title varied throughout his time in the game. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Ullesin was removed from the game.",
