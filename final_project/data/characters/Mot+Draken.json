 "content": "Mot Draken was a male Bith who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, he visited Tansarii Point Station, a space station located near the planet Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. While there, he fell deeply in love with O'choa Detera, a dancer performing in the station's cantina and decided to remain on the station. Two years later, In 1 ABY, he was still living on the station but never had the courage to talk to Detera and share his feelings. A baffling attempt at impressing the dancer was stuffing his mouth with Flurr-Cle onions. Then, O'choa Detera finally understood why Draken was spending so much time in the cantina but she instead had a crush on Bun'Del, one of Mot's friends.\nMot Draken appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mot Draken was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
