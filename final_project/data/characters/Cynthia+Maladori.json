 "content": "Lady Cynthia Maladori was a noble of House Melantha that governed the Melantha Province of the Tapani sector.\nWhen she was young, Lady Maladori and High Lord Bal Jaset were romantically involved. During a house succession battle she betrayed his trust and promoted her brother at the expense of Jaset. When Jaset became High Lord he made life very hard for Cynthia and her family lost a great deal of influence in house affairs. She was resolved to restoring her family's position.\nThe Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008, lists Maladori's first name as Cynith. It is unclear which is the correct version.",
