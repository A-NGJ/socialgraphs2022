 "content": "Bumblethunk was an Esoomian brawler designated as Prowling Thug 36 in the criminal Razzi Syndicate under crime lord Latts Razzi. By 10 BBY, Bumblethunk had encountered the gambler Lando Calrissian, who considered the Esoomian a goon and took a swing at the brawler in order to impress a Trianii debutante. Bumblethunk beat up Calrissian, who then had the book known as the Smuggler's Guide lifted from his person by the Razzi Syndicate thief \"Sticky Fingers.\"\nThe book ended up in the possession of Razzi herself, who was informed of Bumblethunk's part in its acquisition by her submister Twirm. The book later fell back into the hands of Calrissian, who annotated his previous entries with a note stating that he regretted attacking Bumblethunk and losing the book.\nBumblethunk was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, which was written by Daniel Wallace.",
