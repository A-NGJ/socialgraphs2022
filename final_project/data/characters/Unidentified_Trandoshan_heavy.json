 "content": "A Trandoshan male heavy worked for the gambling syndicate led by the crime lord Cenevax. Between 68 BBY and 42 BBY, the Trandoshan, along with two others, were sent to collect the wreckage of the airspeeder piloted by the racer Ramil in the forty-eighth annual Dragonfire Air Rallyâ€”Ramil had made a deal with Cenevax in which he would purposefully lose the race so that Cenevax would gain profits from those who bet on him, but did not follow Cenevax's orders, and was thus sabotaged.\nThe Jedi Master Dooku, Ramil's brother, along with the Padawan Qui-Gon Jinn, pursued the Trandoshans as they took the wreckage. The other two Trandoshans were killed in the pursuit, and the survivor was interrogated by Dooku. Coruscant Security Force police droids arrived on the scene, and Dooku handed the Trandoshan heavy into their custody. The Trandoshan attempted to run, and the droids shot him down, claiming that they only intended to stun him. The body of the Trandoshan was taken to a morgue, where the corrupt Inspector Sartori intended to cover up the crime.",
