Vara became famous when the smuggler outran the forces of the Sith Lord Exar Kun to bring supplies to the refugees on the planet Aduba-6.\nSol Vara was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Duros species in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. However, the Duros entry, along with many of the entries that could be found on the planet Dromund Kaas, were removed before the game's final release in 2011.
