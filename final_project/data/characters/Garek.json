 "content": "Garek was a male Sullustan spy who worked for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Agent Garek was stationed on Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system. During that time, he managed a network of Rebel spies collecting information regarding Imperial activity, including Rund Jesela and Adery Shrial.\nIn 1 ABY, Garek was very concerned about the Rak'qua, a Nautolan tribe living in Station Gamma, another space station in the Bright Jewel system. Rebels spies suspected that the Rak'qua had formed an alliance with the Galactic Empire, allowing Imperials to perform horrible experiments in the station. Garek therefore recruited a group of loyal Rebel spacers to investigate the situation. To evaluate his new recruits, Garek first tasked them to retrieve datadisks with important information from Rebel agents on Tansarii Point Station. Although the datadisks only contained Grandma Drake's soup recipes, the spacers achieved their first mission. They were later ordered to proceed to their new objective: the Rak'qua of Station Gamma. The spacers therefore raided the station, killing a number of hostile Rak'qua during the attack, and successfully sliced the Station Gamma databank. The spacers then returned safely to Tansarii Point Station and delivered the information to Agent Garek. Although Rebel spies were right about an alliance existing between the Rak'qua and the Empire, this arrangement had in fact already been broken by the Rak'qua at that time.\nGarek appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Garek was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
