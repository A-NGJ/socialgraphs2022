 "content": "Officer Jax was a Human Corellian Security Force trooper who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Lasha Bindari tasked a spacer with eliminating two CorSec officers, including Jax.\nJax was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nJax's appearance was randomized between two possible depictions during the quest. Jax could either appear as a Human man with brown hair and brown eyes, or as a Human woman with brown hair and brown eyes. The quest dialogue did not offer any details concerning Jax's appearance, therefore Jax's gender remains ambiguous. In the game, the other colleague which accompanied Officer Jax went unnamed.",
