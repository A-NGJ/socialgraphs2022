 "content": "Fenrol Jarkey was a male Twi'lek resident of Naboo during the Galactic Civil War.\nFenrol Jarkey was the son of Ados Jarkey and the brother of the murderer Hunnos Jarkey. At some point after the Battle of Yavin, he planned to smuggle spice in Theed with Borvo's thug Derm Worrit. In 1 ABY, Fenrol was killed in a 74-Z speeder bike accident some time after the Battle of Yavin, when his speeder bike crashed into a tree at the edge of Theed and caught fire. When agents of the Royal Naboo Security Forces arrived to investigate the scene of the crash, all they found were the scorched remains of Fenrol, his flesh completely burned away.\nFenrol Jarkey appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Fenrol Jarkey was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
