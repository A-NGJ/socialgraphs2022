 "content": "A Human male individual served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a sergeant at some point during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire. The sergeant owned a rifle that he named \"Zarra,\" but he did not tell anyone why he gave his rifle that name. He had fair skin and was a rather heavyset man with brown hair and a mustache that were graying. The sergeant sometimes carried an ammunition belt and wore a brownâ€“colored uniform with gloves and a belt which had at least two pouches.\nThe Rebel sergeant first appeared in 2008 as part of Champions of the Force, the first set of cards for the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game, a virtual card game created by Sony Online Entertainment to go along with the company's 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. The card game was shut down at the same time as Star Wars Galaxies, which was closed on December 15, 2011. He was featured on the Rebel Sergeant card, which was illustrated by the artist Svetlin Velinov.",
