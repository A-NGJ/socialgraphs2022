 "content": "Balko was a male Human lieutenant of the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. At some point he became part of the Order of Revan and defected from the Empire, joining with the Revanite forces on Rishi's Sky Ridge Island under command of Lord Ivress. However, after learning the Revanites' goal he realized his mistake and began working against them. He asked an Imperial infiltrating their camp to use the provided access codes to purge the Revanites' databanks.\nLieutenant Balko appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
