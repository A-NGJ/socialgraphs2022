 "content": "Lo Vapeet, a male Muun from Muunilinst, was the Vice-Chair of Communications for the InterGalactic Banking Clan during the months prior to the Clone Wars.\nLo Vapeet was staunchly loyal to the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and often spoke in favor of the company's operations on HoloNet News and in CIS Shadowfeed feeds prior to and during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Separatist Crisis, when the Banking Clan developed new currencies for systems leaving the Galactic Republic, it reduced the time to register a new currency to just 30 standard minutesâ€”it had previously taken two years and 14 filings to register a new currency.\nVice-Chair Vapeet denied reports of his organization sending armed IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks to Praesitlyn, claiming that they were equipment stolen from the Banking Clan's ledgers by pirates rather than proof of any partisanshrip with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nThe Clone Wars soon ensued, with the Banking Clan providing substantial support to the Confederacy in spite of the non-exclusive arrangement. Still, the Vice-Chair of Communications continued to defend the company by iterating that it was only acting in its best interests in its assistance to the Separatist Alliance.",
