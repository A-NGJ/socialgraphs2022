 "content": "Boakie was a male Human who was part of Aeona Cantor's group that stood against Lord Shadowspawn's rule on the planet Mindor during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 5 ABY, Boakie went with Tripp and a group of followers under the command of Aeona Cantor to help her free Nick Rostu from the power of warlord Shadowspawn. Upon arriving to Mindor, he found R2-D2 when the droid was separated from Luke Skywalker. When Boakie grabbed Artoo however, he received an electrical shock that left him twitching helplessly on the ground.\nBased on the auditory sensors recorded by Artoo, Boakie was said to have an Inner Rim accent when speaking Basic.",
