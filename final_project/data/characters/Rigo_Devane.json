 "content": "Rigo Devane was a male Human who served in the Cularin Militia during the Clone Wars.\nDevane was interested in technology and he also got on well with most people. He was quiet and would fade into the background when not needed.\nDevane makes a possible appearance in Storm's Depths, a scenario in the Living Force campaign. In the scenario, if the player characters require technical support, then Major Xirossk sends Devane with them on a mission.",
