 "content": "\"Come on! You're brave, you're strong, you're my friend!\"\nMace Towani was a Human male who was the son of Catarine Towani and Jeremitt Towani during the time of the New Republics. He was also the older brother of Cindel Towani, being her main guardian and protector through out their lost on the planet of Endor.\nAround 3 ABY, the time of the Battle of Hoth, his family's ship made a crash-landing on the forest moon of Endor. After his parents went missing, he and his sister Cindel befriended a nearby tribe of Ewoks to help rescue his parents. With the help of Logray's magic rock, he discovered that his parents had been kidnapped by the Gorax, and taken to his lair. Mace and Cindel rescued their parents and returned to the village, where everyone celebrated. Jeremitt eventually began working on repairing the crashed star cruiser.\nLater, when Jeremitt's repairs were nearing completion, a group of the Sanyassan Marauders attacked the Ewok village, killing many. Mace was killed by an explosion while hiding in a hut, with Jeremitt and Catarine also dying. This left Cindel alone with the Ewoks and Noa Briqualonâ€”an old hermit who was a former scout. With them, Cindel embarked on a journey to the Marauders' castle, in order to avenge her family, and defeat the Marauders, while rescuing those Ewoks who had been captured. Following the battle, she and Briqualon left the forest moon.\nIn the two Ewok films, Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor, Mace Towani was portrayed by Eric Walker. The name \"Mace\" actually dates back to the earliest incarnation of Star Wars, a 13-page treatment written by George Lucas in 1973 called Journal of the Whills, Part I.",
