 "content": "Doli-bur Barc was a male, bearded Human Senator representing his constituents in the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA Human politician, Doli-bur Barc served in the Galactic Republic Senate around 3643 BBY following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire. Part of the Cold War-era Senate, Barc represented the interests of his constituents by serving on Coruscant, having offices in the Senate Building. After careful analysis of the Imperial military, Senator Barc began to believe that the use of slavery could be the key to beating the Sith and returning the Republic to dominance. Purchasing an entire shipment of Rylothian slave collars, Barc intended to use the collars in the Republic Military to bolster the Republic's numbers.\nAs Barc's shipment arrived on Coruscant members of the Migrant Merchants' Guild hijacked the shipment and they were dispersed among the Guild's members in the Old Galactic Market. Displeased by the hijacking, Senator Barc ordered the Coruscant Security Force to locate the shipment and return it to his office. When Captain Denal-zon's men were bogged down on the Galactic Market concourse, a representative of the Senator named Heerimus tipped of another individual to track down the shipment and return it. While the independent individual did collect the slave collars, Captain Denal-zon caught up to them and was able to convince the individual to bring the illegal chips to him for destruction.\nDoli-bur Barc appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Coruscant quest called \"The Senator's Stolen Goods\". The player can also choose to return the shipment of collars to the Senator, or to talk to the Senator and tell him that the chips must be destroyed before taking them to Captain Denal-zon. This article assumes that the player made the light side choice and did not speak to Senator Barc at all.\nBarc appears in the \"Signs of War\" trailer released on October 14, 2011, where a clip of a player giving Barc his son's journal is shown. However, Satele Shan's narration of the scene describes it as \"corruption on Coruscant,\" despite it being nothing of the sort.",
