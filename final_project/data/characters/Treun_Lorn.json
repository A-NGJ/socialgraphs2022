 "content": "Treun Lorn was a Human scientist who assisted Nycolai Kinesworthy in the creation of N-K Necrosis. After Necrosis was completed, Lorn later broke down psychotically. He stole and hid the deadly droid deep within the Myyydril Caverns for his own experiments, believing that it was his \"master.\"\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, a group of spacers stumbled onto Lorn's hidden laboratory. He used these spacers as unwitting pawns to complete his work on N-K Necrosis, by retrieving a power crystal that was contained somewhere in the vast depths of the caverns. Once this crystal was retrieved, Lorn granted the spacers access to his secret chamber. With the final piece of the puzzle now in his possession, Treun activated N-K Necrosis and his NK-3 guard droids and set them on the spacers. Lorn underestimated the tenacity of these spacers, however, as his droid creations were destroyed in the ensuing firefight.\nTreun Lorn appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
