 "content": "The Bothan Golm Fervse'dra was considered the first leader of the Stone Clan. In his time, Bothawui was divided among the clans, and conflict was common. However, there were no domesticated animals that could carry the weapons of the Bothans, leading to ineffective warfare. Also, the Bothans had the tendency to destroy the object the rival clans were seeking. Golm thus wrote The Way, a publication detailing the Bothan Way—that Bothans should put aside their differences, but in the attainment of power, anything—save violent means—was perfectly acceptable. While considered a hero by the Bothans, other races consider him the source of everything wrong with Bothan society.",
