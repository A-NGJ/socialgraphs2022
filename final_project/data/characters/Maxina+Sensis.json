 "content": "Maxina Sensis was a Human female xenoarchaeologist who worked at Daxis Outpost in the Jandolhoon system as the Chief Researcher.\nBorn in the Parkis system, Sensis had a desire to make new discoveries before anyone else. She used this motivation to succeed in the top learning institutes in the Core Worlds. Shortly before graduation, she saw a promotional holo for the Scout Service. This prompted her to forgo a lucrative career in the private sector and instead go to the Daxis Outpost to serve as the Chief Researcher.\nDuring the time of the New Republic, Sensis analyzed a series of statues and runes recovered from the Serianan system by the scout Korren Starchaser.\nSensis was attentive and eager. She had a passion for detail and was very optimistic.",
