 "content": "Leskogo was a male Human who served in the Republic Army during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was stationed aboard Carrick Station.\nLeskogo appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Corellia Modification Commendations Vendor on Carrick Station, though he was later relabeled as a Level 52 Modification Commendations Vendor. With Game Update 3.0, a Level 60 Modificiation Vendor named Zeskogo was added that was identical to Leskogo. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, the cloned Zeskogo was removed and Leskogo now also appears on a number of worlds in the place of the original armor, weapon, and mods vendors.",
