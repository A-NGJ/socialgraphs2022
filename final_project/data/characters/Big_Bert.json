 "content": "Big Bert was an Ewok who lived on the forest moon of Endor in Bright Tree Village. Big Bert was an eligible Ewok male, and around 3 ABY he was old enough to attend the Shadow Night Festival. The young Ewok Latara believed that Big Bert would ask her to the Festival after she failed to be asked by Tak. However, Big Bert seemed unaware of Latara, and he failed to ask her.",
