 "content": "Anatta was a Toydarian male from the planet Tatooine who made a living as an information broker, and his services were regularly employed by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Anatta traveled to the planet Geonosis and attended a party that was held by the Geonosian noble Duke Piddock, where he hoped to learn some gossip that he could use to impress Jabba. During the event, Anatta encountered a band of fugitives that were on the run from the Hutt Teemo, and he provided them with some information in return for credits.",
