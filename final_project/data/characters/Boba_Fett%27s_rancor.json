 "content": "A rancor was owned by Boba Fett, gifted to him by the Hutts known as the Twins. A rancor keeper assisted Fett by taking care of the rancor, and arrived at Boba Fett's Palace along with the rancor as part of the Twins' tribute. Fett expressed a desire to learn to ride the rancor after hearing that the Witches of Dathomir had been known to do so.\nSometime around 9 ABY, the rancor was gifted to Daimyo Boba Fett by the Hutts known as the Twins. A rancor keeper assisted Fett by taking care of the rancor, and arrived at Boba Fett's Palace along with the rancor as part of the Twins' tribute. The keeper informed the former bounty hunter that the rancor would bond with the first Human it saw. Fett expressed a desire to learn to ride the rancor after hearing that the Witches of Dathomir had been known to do so.\nFett went on to keep it in the rancor pit in Jabba's Palace, and used it to intimidate the crime bosses of Mos Espa.\nAfter the Battle for Mos Espa, the rancor has become Boba's personal mount. He used it to help destroy the two Scorpenek droids that were set loose by the Pyke Syndicate. In the battle, Fett was knocked off, and the rancor started climbing the buildings of the city. The allied fighters tried to shoot it, but the rancor was then subdued and put to sleep by the Force-sensitive youngling Grogu.\nThe rancor first appeared in \"Chapter 3: The Streets of Mos Espa,\" of the The Book of Boba Fett live-action TV series.",
