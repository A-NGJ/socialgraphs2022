 "content": "This individual was a human female officer who served the Resistance in 35 ABY. She was present at a meeting where Commander Poe Dameron revealed that Emperor Palpatine had returned, and was standing next to Aftab Ackbar when the latter insisted that it was impossible due to Palpatine being dead. After the Battle of Exegol and the destruction of Palpatine and the Sith Eternal, she joined in the victory celebrations.\n The character was portrayed by Raghad Chaar in Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker. Her role was confirmed in the movie's credits.",
