 "content": "A male member of the Pau'an species lived and worked as a drug dealer on the planet Coruscant shortly after the destruction of the planet Alderaan in 0 BBY. On Coruscant's Level 1997, he and a Herglic partner met with the fugitive Alderaanian siblings Anandra and Santigo Milon. The Pau'an offered Anandra accommodations and refuge among Coruscant's gangs, but she refused the offer and fled when Imperials arrived at the meeting place.\nA Pau'an male drug dealer lived on the planet Coruscant during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Shortly after the destruction of the planet Alderaan in 0 BBY, he and a Herglic partner met with Anandra Milon and Santigo Milon, two Alderaanian fugitives, in a cantina on Level 1997. The Pau'an offered Anandra shelter and work among Coruscant's gangs, including running goods and making deliveries of death sticks or spice to his clients, but refused to hire Santigo, as the boy was far too young. Anandra attempted to persuade the Pau'an to change his mind about her brother before turning down the offer and fleeing, after two Imperials entered the cantina. One of the Imperials and the Pau'an's partner followed the fugitives, but the Pau'an did not.\nThe Pau'an drug dealer refused to hire Santigo Milon due to his age, as the boy could offer the Pau'an nothing in the way of services. Although he sympathized with the Milons' situation and understood the importance of family and therefore Anandra's unwillingness to be separated from her younger brother, the Pau'an would not relent on his refusal. The Pau'an had a face like a corpse, with leathery gray skin and stained, jagged teeth.\nThe Pau'an appeared in \"One Thousand Levels Down,\" a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 on July 22, 2014.",
