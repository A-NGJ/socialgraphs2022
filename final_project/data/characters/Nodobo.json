 "content": "Nodobo was a male Rodian swoop racer on Nar Shaddaa. When Meetra Surik met him in the year 3951 BBY he had spent all of his credits on upgrading his swoop bike in order to become the champion of the circuit; the prize money was a large enough sum to allow him to leave Nar Shaddaa. His plan was thwarted by Lupo Shar, the owner of the racing circuit, who had commissioned the construction of a droid, C9-T9, to be an unbeatable swoop riding champion.",
