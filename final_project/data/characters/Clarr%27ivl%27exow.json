 "content": "Clarr'ivl'exow, core name Rivlex, was a Chiss male who was the Patriarch of the Chiss Ascendancy's Clarr family. He resided on the planet Rhigar, where he had a standing policy that refused landing permission to all non-Chiss vessels. When Jixtus, an associate of Generalirius Nakirre who was traveling aboard the Kilji war cruiser Whetstone, requested to speak with the Patriarch about a supposed threat from within the Ascendancy, Captain Clarr'os'culry \"Roscu\" wished to judge whether the information was worthy of being passed onto Rivlex; however, as the Patriarch's policy prevented Jixtus from landing on Rhigar, Roscu agreed to meet aboard the Whetstone instead.",
