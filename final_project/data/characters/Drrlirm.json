 "content": "Drrlirm was a male Wookiee that lived at the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was an expert on surviving the wilderness of Kashyyyk and worked as an informant for queen Kylantha of Naboo.\n1.5 years ABY, Kylantha asked Drrlirm and his friends Orrekazzapirr and Imarrra to travel to their home world Kashyyyk and investigate the news that the Imperial force stationed on the planet was assisting the Trandoshan slavers. On Kashyyyk, Drrlirm and his friends tried to investigate the Trandoshan's slaving operations in one of their camps near Kachirho, but were ambushed and overpowered. Drrlirm was the only one that escaped, severely wounded. He stayed in the jungles for days, trying to regain his strength to get back to Kachirho. He was found by an adventurer sent by queen Kylantha, as the queen had been worried after she hadn't received any news from the Wookiees. The adventurer escorted Drrlirm back to Kachircho, fending off several Trandoshan slavers on their way. Then the spacer went on to find Orrekazzapirr and Imarra, which were eventually freed from the Imperial prison on Dathomir.\nDrrlirm was a Non-Player Character  in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. During the quest To the Queen's Aid the player was sent to Kashyyyk to search for the missing Wookiees. Drrlirm appeared in the jungle near Kachirho and had to be escorted back to the city. On the way, several Trandoshan slaver NPCs spawned and have to be killed quickly before they could kill Drrlirm.",
