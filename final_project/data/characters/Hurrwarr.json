 "content": "Hurrwarr was a male Wookiee who worked as a bartender in the Cabana Bar, the cantina of the hotel Sanads of Rorkee in the city of Rorkee, on Genarius. Locals tried to convince newcomers to play a supposed game called Stump-the-Wookiee-Bartender.\nHurrwarr suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder; he combed and cleaned his fur—even while working, took pains to keep things in the places he had chosen for them, and suffered whenever he saw a cup without its coaster. His excessive behavior took a toll among his clientele; more than a few disliked Hurrwarr's attitude and did not came back.\nIn 31 BBY, Hurrwarr attended Dr. Shilaea Motacc, a guest of the hotel who went several times to the Bar to enjoy Double-Dip Outer Rim Rumdrops. Soon after Motacc's apparent death, an unidentified customer went to the Bar during Hurrwarr's break, bought all the stock of Rim Rumdrops, paying in cash, and forgot some spectacles on the bar — without a coaster, to Hurrwarr's chagrin.",
