 "content": "A captain served aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor circa 3.5 ABY, following the Battle of Hoth. He reported to Darth Vader that a device on the planet Shalyvane had self-destructed, meaning that Luke Skywalker had fallen into a trap set by Vader. Vader then ordered the captain to set course for Krake's Planet, where the Dark Lord hoped to capture his son.\nGiven the proximity of the sources Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook and Star Wars  63 in the Star Wars timeline, it would perhaps seem plausible that this character is Captain Kallic, who assumes command of the Executor while Darth Vader is recalled to Coruscant following his encounter with Luke Skywalker on Bespin. However, no source connects these two characters in any way.",
