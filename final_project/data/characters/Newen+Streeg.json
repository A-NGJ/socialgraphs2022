 "content": "Newen Streeg was a Human male Imperial Governor who governed Periphery sector, located near the Sisar Run, during the New Order. His flagship was the Ion Storm, a Strike-class cruiser.\nUnlike most other ranking Imperial officials, Streeg never attended the Imperial Academy and had minimal ties to the Navy. He came to see the Galactic Empire as the perfect government as his mother was killed by pirates when he was thirteen. Streeg blamed her death on the chaos that sprang out of the last days of the Old Republic.\nHe was sworn to removing the criminal element along the Sisar Run, but had no idea how widespread Vigo Sprax's empire actually was, nor how well it was connected. In fact, Streeg purchased nearly all his starship replacement parts — and many new starships — from one of Sprax's own organizations.",
