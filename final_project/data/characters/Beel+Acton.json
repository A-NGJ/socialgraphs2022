 "content": "Beel Acton was a Force-sensitive male Human who grew up on Brentaal IV as the son of a businessman.\nActon was always a cruel and evil child, especially after his mother died when he was three years old. He used his Force powers to subtly control people so that they would still like him, no matter how cruel he was. In his teens, a Jedi attempted to recruit him, but he refused. When his father lay dying, Acton secretly finished him off so that he would obtain all of his family's money. He then proceeded to roam the galaxy, causing others pain and suffering using the Force. He was also searching for the Sith, and longed to join them.",
