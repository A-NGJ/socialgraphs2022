 "content": "Renak was a Mantellian Savrip that, along with L'raak and Sterrin, served the Hutt Archon Szajin as a scout during the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY. The trio were assigned to the Cartel mining mesa, where they were slain.\nRenak, Sterrin, and L'raak appear in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as Champion bosses on Makeb. Unlike other enemy NPCs, they will not attack players within range but only when attacked. They are not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of an achievement; this article assumes 100% game completion, which means they were killed.",
