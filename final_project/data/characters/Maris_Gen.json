 "content": "Maris Gen was the owner of \"The Underground\", a cantina on Tilnes. He was a Rodian who liked living in the tunnels. He was highly allergic to sunlight, which caused his skin to flake off if exposed to it for more than a minute. He had light and dark patches all over his exposed flesh which testified to that.\nMaris paid a lot of attention to the conversations going on in his cantina. He missed little, and when interesting discussions were going on, glasses found themselves quickly refilled.",
