 "content": "Tanye Trila was a sergeant in the Republic Army during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nWith a reputation for toughness, Trila has participated in several campaigns throughout the galaxy, including the battle against separatist forces at Mannett Point on Ord Mantell, and against the Empire at Axial Park on Corellia. She also became embroiled in the battle against the Dread Masters, a group of renegade Sith Lords; she had been on Belsavis during their escape, and had acted as military support against Kephess and his Warstalkers on Denova.\nIn 3638 BBY, Trila was a member of Strike Team Oricon, an expedition under the command of the Jedi Master Ogan-Dei to bring an end to the Dread Masters at their newly-discovered base on the volcanic moon of Oricon. The Dread Masters destroyed most of the force, and Trila was the highest-ranking military survivor. While Ogan-Dei used his Jedi powers to protect the base camp from the Dread Masters' powers, Trila dispatched a strike team of heroes from the Republic into the field to battle against the Dread Host and pave the way for the attack against the Dread Fortress.",
