 "content": "Orlian was a male Human doctor of the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War. When stationed on the planet Quesh during the Quesh war, he was the key scientist at the Empire's Quesh venom processing lab, though he eventually decided to defect to the Galactic Republic. His overseer Captain Jesh caught on to his suspicious behavior and incarcerated Orlian, though he was nevertheless sprung out and extracted by a Republic citizen shortly after that, and SIS agent Meldo moved Orlian to one of the SIS's safe houses",
