 "content": "Tromak was a Gran male worshipper of the Elders of the Path and a leader in the Council of Elders who held the title of Elder. As a young child, Tromak was a Little in the Force cult the Path of the Open Hand, watched over by Marda Ro around the time she met Kevmo Zink.\nMany years later, when Trymant IV fell under threat from the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Zeen Mrala and Krix Kamerat, who had been raised by the Elders of the Path, saw Tromak being evacuated on a Nihil ship, although the pirates would not let the two young people board. Tromak left Trymant IV with the Marchion Ro and the Nihil, bringing Kamerat with him. Onboard the Gaze Electric, Tromak was hesitant to give information to Ro about the location of an ancient artifact, and was thus sent to the battle rink with Kamerat, after divulging the location of the artifact in question. In the rink, the two participated in an arena battle, Tromak riding a Bogaranth. After a holoprojector was found, Tromak was accused by Kamerat of being a traitor.\nTromak eventually escaped the Nihil with a Bogaranth, and made it to Quantxi, where he met with Yoda and discussed the artifact. The two departed together for Vrant Tarnum, the location of the artifact, but were shot down by drones on their descent.",
