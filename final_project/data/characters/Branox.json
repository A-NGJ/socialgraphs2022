 "content": "Branox was a Hrakian spacer who, in 1 ABY, made a stop at Vorzyd V. Branox was getting drunk in a spaceport cantina when he had an encounter with the Rebel droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who were on the hunt for a Hrakian pilot. Their owner Luke Skywalker, along with fellow Rebels Leia Organa, Falud, and Paxin were being held captive by Imperial troops aboard a Hrakian starship, and the droids needed a Hrakian to pose as their owner to help them get aboard. C-3PO and R2-D2 quickly identified the confused and near-unconscious Branox as a perfect candidate, and ushered the confused spacer to the starship and used him to pass security. As soon as they reached their destination, they cast Branox aside, telling him they needed to register with the \"droid steward.\"\nBranox made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity in Gambler's World, a comic strip story arc written and illustrated by Russ Manning and released in 1979.",
