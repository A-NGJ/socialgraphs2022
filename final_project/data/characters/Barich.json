 "content": "Barich was a human male Imperial scout trooper who held the rank of sergeant.\nBarich was born on Wakeelmui. He became an employee of Sienar Fleet Systems's missile division until, prior to 4 ABY, he eventually joined the Empire's Stormtrooper Corps as a scout trooper and gained the rank of Sergeant, though he dreamed of flying with the 181st Imperial Fighter Wing. He, along with fellow scout trooper, Corporal Misik, helped develop speeder bike tactics.\nIn 4 ABY, Barich was stationed on the forest moon of Endor. Assigned to protect the bunker which generated Death Star II's shields, Barich was partnered with another scout trooper and they patrolled Endor on speeder bikes looking for threats. A Rebel strike force landed on the moon and were spotted by Barich and his partner, who took off on their bikes to get help. Two of the Rebels, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa followed on their own speeder bike and quickly caught up with Barich's partner. Skywalker knocked off him off his bike and jumped on it himself.\nThe pair continued to chase after Barich, who rode past Misik and his partner, Corporal Drelosyn. The two additional scout troopers followed behind the Rebels and began to shoot at them, causing Skywalker to break off from Organa to deal with the two. Organa caught up to Barich, who drew his blaster pistol and proceeded to shoot at her, causing her to fall off her bike, which crashed into a tree. Barich looked back to see the bike's explosion, then turned forward and realized that he was on a collision course with a fallen tree. He screamed as he crashed into it, causing his bike to explode, killing him.\nBarich wore the standard Imperial Scout trooper armor and helmet. He rode a 74-Z speeder bike and was equipped with a small blaster pistol.",
