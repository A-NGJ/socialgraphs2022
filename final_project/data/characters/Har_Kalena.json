 "content": "Har Kalena was an Human that lived in the Brak sector during the height of the Galactic Empire.\nAt some point following the promotion of Moff Lesan Ramier over the sector, Imperial restrictions made life very difficult for the citizens of the area. Kalena was eventually apprehended by the Imperials and imprisoned for unspecified reasons. However, Kalena's sister, Fae Kalena, took up the search for her brother with the hopes of rescuing him. She contacted the Bacrana System Defense Force and its leader Trep Reskan for help in the search. Reskan believed that Kalena was incarcerated in the Tarok Detention Center.",
