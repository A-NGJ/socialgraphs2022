 "content": "Sajin was a Human male who had black hair, green eyes, and tan skin, and was promoted to the rank of Corporal in the Galactic Republic before or during 3642 BBY.\nDuring a mission on Hoth in 3642 BBY, Sajin was part of Yuun's squad until they were ambushed by Sith Imperials. A  Republic trooper was able to drive them out of the attack, but Sajin was badly wounded from the confrontation. The Havoc Squad medical specialist, Elara Dorne, did all she could to ease Sajin's pain, but the injuries were fatal. Sajin asked the captain to warn about the cause and died from his wounds. The captain fulfilled that promise.",
