 "content": "Ka-Tu-Un was a male Cerean Force-adept who lived during the later years of the New Republic. He trained as a member of the Cerean Ner Yan tradition, translating into Basic as \"mind chord.\" This group trained their minds to attune to the Force, linking their minds together.\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, Ka-Tu-Un was one of a number of refugees trying to flee Druckenwell. He tried to escape onboard the MOD-17 container freighter, Chilastra, but realized that he had been mistaken by the invaders as a member of the New Jedi Order.\nWhile attempting to escape the Yuuzhan Vong, Ka-Tu-Un was sold out by Doctor Vlohei, which led to his capture and interrogation by the Yuuzhan Vong.\nIn the Hive of the Infidel article, Ka-Tu-Un is presented as a Force-adept of the Ner Yan tradition with no formal affiliation to the New Jedi Order as led by Luke Skywalker. However, the Wizards of the Coast preview described him as a Jedi Knight.",
