 "content": "Wad'e Tay'haai was a Human male who was one of seventy-five Mandalorian warriors that were comprised in the Cuy'val Dar.\nHe was a member of the group who were a cadre of battle-hardened training sergeants hand-picked by Jango Fett to train elite clone commandos and Covert Ops clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic. Although most of the Cuy'val Dar disappeared after completing the terms of their contract following the First Battle of Geonosis, Jedi Master Arligan Zey later requested that several return to instruct clone troopers selected for commando cross-training. A reluctant Tay'haai eventually joined Mij Gilamar in accepting the offer, but they did so with ulterior motives, agreeing to assist Kal Skirata in his efforts to investigate the Republic's shifting strategies in the waning days of the Clone Wars.\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, mere days after Order 66, Tay'haai left the GAR with liberated clones, a party led by Kal Skirata.\nTay'haai was known to wield a traditional Mandalorian hunting spear known as a bevii'ragir, as well as a Bes'bev in addition to his purple Mandalorian armor.",
