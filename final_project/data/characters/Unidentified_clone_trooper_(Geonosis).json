 "content": "A clone trooper served in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 22 BBY, he participated in the Battle of Geonosis, the war's opening engagement, supporting several other clone troopers, including clone commando RC-1138, in successfully defending a barricade from advancing Separatist battle droids. The clone survived the attack and took part in pushing the droids back to a Separatist gun emplacement.\nBorn on the planet Kamino, the clone trooper was a Human clone of Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter. He served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In 22 BBY, the trooper participated in the Battle of Geonosis, the first conflict of the Clone Wars, as the Republic fought to capture the Separatist-held planet.\nHe and his fellow troopers—17, Three-Five, and a third trooper—were defending a barricade from Separatist B1-Series battle droids when clone commando RC-1138, nicknamed \"Boss,\" approached the group. The trooper warned the commando of the dangers ahead, specifically the large number of enemy combatants. As Boss entered the area, the attacking battle droids blew through a wall, killing one of the troopers. The surviving clones defended themselves against the assault and prevented the droids' advance, proceeding to push the droid line back to a Separatist gun emplacement.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, the clone trooper stood at a height of 1.83 meters. He warned Boss of the large number of hostile combatants ahead of the commando, showing loyalty and camaraderie with fellow clones.\nThe clone trooper wore white Phase I clone trooper armor and was armed with a DC-15S.\nThis clone trooper appeared in the 2005 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Republic Commando.",
