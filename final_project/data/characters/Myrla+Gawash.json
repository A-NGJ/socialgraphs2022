 "content": "Myrla Gawash was a female Human member of the Gawash family, a family of workers during the Galactic War, living in Talaos City on Makeb along with Roop Gawash and Fillan Gawash. During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY Talaos was placed under curfew with InterStellar Regulators patrolling the streets, while the Hutt Cartel paid the workers extra to stay inside their homes. When the planet became unstable due to mining of Isotope-5 from its core, Groundquakes began to spread across Makeb. Republic Medical Corps specialist Tefani tried to evacuate them, but Roop became convinced the Republic was trying to con him out of his credits and forbade his family to leave. Eventually, a Republic operative working for Shalim Avesta came along and convinced the Gawash family to evacuate, shortly before the building they were in was destroyed by a groundquake.\nMyrla Gawash appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion, added to the game with Update 2.0.",
