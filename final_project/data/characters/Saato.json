 "content": "Saato was a witch from Dathomir and a Dark Acolyte who worked for Count Dooku during the Clone Wars. She wielded two red-bladed lightsaber shotos.\nDuring the rise of the C-B3 cortosis battle droids, Saato was sent to Tatooine to capture Raala Ponchar, a Galactic Republic spy whom had learned more about this new menace to the galaxy. She did this with relative ease, and imprisoned the spy in the dungeons from Jabba Desilijic Tiure.\nWith the aid of Aurra Sing, she tried to halt the advance of Anakin Skywalker who had been sent to the planet to search for Ponchar. Sing first tried to stop him near Mos Espa, but Saato had to step in to save the bounty hunter in front of Jabba the Hutt's palace. She managed to subdue Skywalker by Force choking him. After he had passed out, she left him in the same cell as Ponchar.\nUnfortunately for Saato, she had severely underestimated the power of the Chosen One. Anakin easily managed to escape Jabba's dungeons and had managed to retrieve the information that Ponchar carried. As he escaped by stealing a skiff from the Hutt, Saato commandeered one of her own, and shot Skywalker down on his way back to his Jedi Starfighter near the Great Pit of Carkoon.\nDeciding to take care of Skywalker once and for all, she engaged in a fierce battle with the Jedi. In the duel that followed, only the Chosen One walked away victoriously, resulting in Saato's death.\nSaato was quite capable in battle and the Force, able to command Aurra Sing to do her bidding, and telekinetically grip and strangle Anakin Skywalker into unconsciousness. In lightsaber dueling, Saato was a fierce opponent, striking with her shotos in whirlwinding pinwheel acrobatics.\nIt is possible to kill Saato in two ways. The usual one is by killing her via a lightsaber. However, by careful maneuvering and carefully timed attacks, Saato can be pushed into the pit of Carkoon and be devoured by the sarlacc.",
