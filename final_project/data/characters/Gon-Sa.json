 "content": "Gon-Sa was a Voss male who served as a diplomat. He attended a meeting at which Republic Senator Evran and Sith Lord Torius were trying to convince the Voss to join their respective sides for protection. The Voss however had no need for protection - the mystic foresaw all threats, like when Mystic Ki-Ve saw that Torius planned to detonate a ZR-57 orbital strike bomb at Voss-Ka. The Voss knew that he would be stopped by Havoc Squad Major and did not interfere until the Sith was dead, after which they revealed all they knew and asked the Republic to give them the bomb for study.",
