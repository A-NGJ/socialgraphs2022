 "content": "Shalath was a female Human Sith Lord and Sith alchemist who served the Sith Empire on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas. During the Cold War she was camped near the rogue Sith Lord Grathan's estate where she sent several Sith Acolytes with Sith runes to bind a Sithspawn created by Sith alchemy. The acolytes were killed by the spawn and so Shalath hired several other Imperials to recover the Runes and complete the task.\nAccording to the game files for Star Wars: The Old Republic, Shalath was originally named \"Lord Sunder.\" She was also involved in a cut quest given by Apprentice Frun, whose master was engaged in a Kaggath with Shalath. Frun would have asked players to deliver a message to Shalath's apprentice Maraad.",
