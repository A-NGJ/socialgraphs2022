 "content": "Dorian was a Human male slave on Dromund Kaas. Driven insane by Force phenomena within the Dark Temple, his fellow slaves and archaeologists -- previously tasked with recovering data -- began to worship him as an omnipotent leader, after he was briefly influenced by the ancient Sith Lord Nil Venerous. Dorian however, regained his sanity and an ability to reason but sought to exploit his position as \"Venerous\" for his own gain by continuing to play the part of Sith Lord.",
