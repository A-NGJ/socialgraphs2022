She was a House Mecetti sleeper agent who planned to maneuver herself, her husband or eventually her children into House Pelagia's Privy council.\nPrior to the Battle of Endor Mellona was a beautiful woman in her early twenties, a dedicated socialite who treated Procopia as her personal playground.
