 "content": "Taki was a Human female and a skilled fighter, who originated from an unknown world outside the known galaxy.\nTaki appeared on an icy planet in one of Starkiller's visions and took a crystalline silver-blue sword from his reach. Taki, using the newly-acquired sword, proceeded to fight Starkiller, and the two eventually entered a deadlock. Starkiller spotted an opening in Taki's defense and struck her down with Force lightning. Before walking away and leaving Taki for dead, Starkiller took the sword as his own.\nTaki usually wore a purple jumpsuit with her shoulders protected by metal guards and her hair tied up in a ponytail.\nTaki was a skilled assassin and adept in sword-fighting. She used a stolen sword to fight Starkiller, though was known to carry a blade of her own.\nTaki was pitted against Starkiller as an introduction for Starkiller's appearance in Soulcalibur IV, a popular fighting game.",
