 "content": "Doctor Blayne was a male Human scientist who operated from an asteroid base during the era of the Clone Wars. In around 21 BBY, Blayne developed a type of liquid metal that could be used to encapsulate sentient beings and turn them into living droids. Hoping to profit from the substance, Blayne contacted the criminal Shorran Dak to arrange a deal for the sale of the metal for use as a form of weaponry. However, Dak was captured by the Jedi Order while en-route to Blayne's base and the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker arrived at the asteroid in his place, posing as Dak and his bodyguard. Blayne suspected that the pair were connected to the Galactic Republic authorities, and after welcoming the Jedi into his facility, he had some of his living droids turn on Skywalker, so as to demonstrate their effectiveness as a weapon. Kenobi and Skywalker revealed themselves to be Jedi and Blayne deactivated some of the droids, to enable the liquid metal to leave them and smother Skywalker, which gave Blayne full control of the Jedi's movements. Blayne briefly set Skywalker against Kenobi, but the two Jedi soon overcame the metal and Kenobi covered Blayne with the substance instead, transforming into a bio-droid who served the Jedi.",
