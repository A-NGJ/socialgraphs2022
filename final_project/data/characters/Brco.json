 "content": "Brco was an Ilwizzt male who lived on G'rho and served in the G'rho Defense Force.\nBrco achieved the rank of major with the G'rho Defense Force, and was stationed at Boku Settlement. There he hired Ydra Sibwarra as a historian, at the bidding of her brother Trig, a pilot in the Defense Force. When the Ssi-ruu invaded the planet in 2 BBY, Brco was in charge. He ordered the small G'rho Defense Force air force to attack the alien ships, but they were easily defeated. The Ssi-ruu retaliated by attacking Brco's compound with some form of knockout gas. Brco ordered an evacuation of the facility.",
