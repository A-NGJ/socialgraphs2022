 "content": "Bakkel was a female Human Beast Rider killed by Meetra Surik in Iziz on Onderon while she was seeking holodiscs for Dhagon Ghent. Bakkel refused to give the holodiscs to Surik and became hostile forcing Surik to kill her and her companions. She and her companions were often seen in the Beast Riders' Den in the western cantina.\n\nBakkel and her Beast-Riders had been operating in Iziz for several months prior to the Onderon Civil War. After the doctor Dhagon Ghent was arrested in connection with the murder of Guard Captain Sullio, Bakkel and her gang looted Ghent's office and took, among other things, encrypted holodisks containing the proper protocol for contacting his political connections in the Royal Palace. After Ghent was released Meetra Surik requested his help in contacting Jedi Master Kavar, who currently resided in the Royal Palace as an advisor to Queen Talia. Ghent informed her that without the holodisks stolen by Bakkel, he couldn't meet make contact with his connections. Surik met with Bakkel in the Iziz Cantina and tried to convince her to return the holodisks, but Bakkel became belligerent and attacked her and her companions. Bakkel and her gang were killed in the battle, and Surik returned the holodisks to Ghent.",
