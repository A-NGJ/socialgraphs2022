 "content": "Camie Loneozner was a Human female who was a friend of Luke Skywalker at Anchorhead during the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. Her family managed an underground hydroponic garden on Tatooine, and bought most of their water from Owen Lars's farm. She hung out at Tosche Station with Janek \"Tank\" Sunber, Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner, Biggs Darklighter, and Skywalker.\nCamie was involved with Laze Loneozner, whom she eventually married when Luke Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter left Tatooine. Laze Loneozner built an illegal podracer to sell in order to raise enough funds for a lavish wedding party for her.\nAfter the deaths of Owen and Beru Lars, some of the locals believed that their nephew had murdered them. Camie Loneozner, having spent much time with him, didn't believe those rumors at all. After the Battle of Yavin, she told this to historian Voren Na'al in an interview.\nWhen TaggeCo decided to test their Omega Frost technology on Tatooine, they bought up a number of the local moisture farms. The Loneozners took over the operations of the old Darklighter farm and were hired by the Tagges to take care of all of the local properties.\nThe two Loneozners ran into Luke Skywalker when he returned to Tatooine on a mission for the Rebellion. They feared that Skywalker might cause trouble and ruin their relationship with the Tagges, and so they reported him to the Imperials. However, Fixer Loneozner had second thoughts about turning in his old friend and decided to warn Skywalker about the Imperials, allowing the young Rebel to escape capture.\nCamie was portrayed by Koo Stark in A New Hope, though her scenes were not used in the final film release. Her deleted scenes appeared in the first issue of the Marvel Star Wars comics adaptation of A New Hope, and she also appeared in Star Wars  17 and Star Wars  31. The lost scenes from A New Hope can be seen in Star Wars: Behind the Magic.\nShe was portrayed by Stephanie Steele for the Star Wars Radio Drama on National Public Radio.\nHer name has sometimes been misspelled as \"Cammie\".\nAn action figure released by Hasbro in 2010 Star Wars: Shadows of the Dark Side set gave Camie the last name \"Marstrap\", a name that was once given to another of Luke Skywalker's friends, Windy. Windy was later given the last name \"Starkiller\", which was considered canonical in the continuity of Star Wars Legends.",
