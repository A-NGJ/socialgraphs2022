 "content": "Bickell was a male Zabrak Lieutenant of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nIn 3638 BBY Bickell participated in the Korriban Incursion along with Commander Jensyn, but he and his men left Jensyn in the Dark Council Chambers and started to pull out after the Sith Academy was taken and their objective completed. However, they learned that the Empire launched an Assault on Tython at the very same time and Bickell and his men were immediately redeployed to a new battlefield, assisting in retaking the Jedi Temple.",
