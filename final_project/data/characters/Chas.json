 "content": "The Chas were a family of bounty hunters who operated during the reign of the Galactic Empire. They consisted of Ramat Cha, Bhada Cha, and Chanath Cha. They were hired to assassinate the Sith Lord Darth Vader, though they were unsuccessful and Vader killed Ramat and Bhada. Chanath was forced by her parents to swear that she would not seek revenge against Vader. Chanath, however, saw the deaths of her parents as the death of her heart, and therefore the end of her oath, and decided to become a pet operative of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine in order to get close to Vader and take her revenge, but she never saw him again.",
