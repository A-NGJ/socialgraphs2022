 "content": "Sleightan was a Human male con artist. Along with the droid L7-BO, Sleightan ran a scam where he would sell the droid to group of spacers, claiming it was the property of his dead son, Armbrus. Once the deal had been done, L7-BO would find an opportunity to leave the spacers and rejoin Sleightan so they could run the scam again.",
