 "content": "Larook was a Hutt with a masculine personality who was the leader of the Bareesh kajidic during the Galactic Civil War. Though once one of the leading Hutt clans, by the time of Larook's reign the kajidic had declined in power and sought to return to prominance once more. To that end, Larook aggressively involved himself and the Bareesh in Hutt politics, much to the ire of the more influential Hutt clans.",
