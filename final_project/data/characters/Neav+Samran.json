 "content": "Lieutenant Neav Samran was a heavyset Human male officer of the Lorrd Security Forces as of 40 ABY. A brown-haired moustached man approaching middle-ages, Samran was an affiliate of Jedi Nelani Dinn, the Knight stationed on Lorrd, his home planet.\nDuring a visit by Jacen Solo and Ben Skywalker, Samran witnessed a rise in Jedi-related crimes and suicide attempts, including sightings of Force ghosts - including Borth Pazz and Ordith Huarr. Samran and his officers aided the three Jedi in their resolutions, and impounded Brisha Syo and her vessel on the advice on young Skywalker.",
