 "content": "Serena Fenner was a Human female who was known to be on Naboo during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSerena Fenner appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Serena Fenner would have been on Naboo. However, Serena Fenner is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
