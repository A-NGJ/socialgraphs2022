 "content": "Wollok was a male Human who worked for the Corellian Security Force on the planet Corellia. During the Galactic War between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Corellian Security Force sided with the Republic during the Battle of Corellia. Wollok was stationed in the Republic-controlled Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport. There, he worked as a medium armor merchant while wearing yellow and grey armor, and a helmet. Wollok had dark skin, brown eyes and black hair.\nWollok appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Medium Armor Vendor for Republic players on Corellia. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Wollok was removed from the game along with the rest of the Medium Armor Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
