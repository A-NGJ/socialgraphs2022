 "content": "Tubleek Ruz was a Kubaz bounty hunter who operated during the time of the Galactic Empire. Around the year 3 ABY, the Kubaz joined the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra in a job to steal confiscated Rebel Alliance contraband from the Galactic Empire at Echo Base on the planet Hoth. While Aphra, disguised as a member of the Empire, drove the transport containing the contraband to a rendezvous point where Ruz and the Wookiee bounty hunter ambushed the snowtroopers aboard. As Aphra remarked that they were late, Ruz confronted Aphra, threatening to turn her in for the bounty placed on her. However Aphra, having expected the Kubaz to betray her, had Just Lucky, another member of their team, shoot Ruz from his position nearby.",
