 "content": "Frelka was a male Rodian explorer who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Frelka visited the Bright Jewel system along with his protocol droid E-5KL. They resided in Tansarii Point Station, a space station that they used as a starting point to explore Station Gamma, an asteroid base nearby. In 1 ABY, Frelka and E-5KL flew out to Station Gamma to get treasure but they realized that the station had been taken oven by the Rak'qua, a tribe of aggressive Nautolans. While exploring, Frelka ran into a member of the Rak'qua, the pair fought and Frelka lost causing him to flee the station back to Tansarii, in his haste leaving behind E-5KL. Once back on Tansarii he headed to the cantina to sulk over his defeat. Frelka later met a spacer here who he asked to head back to Station Gamma and find his droid for him. The spacer then traveled to Station Gamma where E-5KL told him of Frelka's defeat and asked that the spacer kill the Rak'qua Aphotic who humiliated Frelka. The spacer did so and returned to Frelka to inform him of his foe's death and the safety of his droid. Frelka begrudgingly thanked the spacer despite wanting to have kept his defeat a secret.\nFrelka was unfriendly and rude after his defeat at the hands of the Rak'qua however this may not of reflected his normal personality. He was also extremely ungrateful to his droid, who he claimed he might scrap, showing he thought of it as a possession not a sentient being. Frelka was presumably also rather inexperienced in combat as the Rak'qua who defeated him was easily slain by an almost untrained spacer.\nFrelka was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Frelka was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. He gave the player a single optional side quest.",
