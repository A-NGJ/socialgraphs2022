 "content": "Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.\nThe son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by killing Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on Ajan Kloss, but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.\nWith the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker traveled across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. In 9 ABY, Skywalker temporarily took on Grogu, a Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same species as Yoda, as an apprentice. However, during Grogu's training, Skywalker sensed that the child's heart wasn't into relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's friend, the Mandalorian Din Djarin visited the planet bearing a gift of chain mail armor for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice: accepting the gift and returning to the Mandalorian, or taking Yoda's lightsaber and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to Djarin.\nSkywalker later took his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength and potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. As Master and Padawan, Skywalker traveled with his nephew and battled the Knights of Ren, studied lost Jedi lore, and gathered others to expand their new order's ranks. In 28 ABY, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in his nephew, briefly contemplated killing him, causing Solo to fall to the dark side like Vader before him and destroy his nascent order. The loss of his nephew haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. The destruction of his temple and the deaths of all his students convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order.\nHis solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.\nIn 35 ABY, Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the war. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, Skywalker urged Rey to confront her grandfather, the resurrected Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister watched over Rey as she buried their lightsabers in Skywalker's childhood home on Tatooine and adopted the Skywalker name as her own to honor their legacy.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda set out on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality. His journey took him to Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld, where he faced visions of the future. At the end of his journey, the Force Priestess, Serenity, who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Yoda heard his voice from the future say so as well. These events alluded to the birth and destiny of Luke Skywalker, as well as his twin sister Leia.\nLuke Skywalker was born in 19 BBY on the asteroid field of Polis Massa two days after the proclamation of the Galactic Empire. He and his twin sister, Leia, who was born minutes after him, are the children of Galactic Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after the births, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and their father, the now-Sith Lord Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi personally sent the infant Luke to be raised by Anakin's stepbrother, Owen Lars and his wife, Beru on the planet Tatooine, while Senator Bail Organa agreed to adopt Leia together with his wife, the queen of Alderaan.\nLuke Skywalker spent his youth on the Lars' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been \"a navigator on a spice freighter\" during the Clone Wars. His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle had business in Mos Eisley, she took Skywalker to Anchorhead to use the HoloNet connections there and show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.\nBy the age of three in 16 BBY, Skywalker had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built especially for him. He did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother Shmi's sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Skywalker played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been watching him from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Skywalker threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included Owen Lars, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a Devaronian, had snuck up behind Lars, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Skywalker cheered, Lars threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Lars then ushered Skywalker back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Skywalker's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.\nShortly after the Battle of Fortress Vader, Darth Vader accessed a portal to the dark side created by Darth Momin in an attempt to revive Padmé Amidala. He eventually found an apparition of Amidala standing on a balcony, who rejected his pleas and threw itself off the ledge and was incinerated by lightning. Just after this, Vader saw a blue light in the distance, out of which emerged an apparition of an adult Luke Skywalker, who blasted him back to reality.\nAround 9 BBY, Kenobi looked in on Skywalker via macrobinoculars around the same time that the Empire's Inquisitors came to Tatooine looking for the Jedi Nari. Skywalker was tasked with a chore by Lars but instead disappeared causing Lars and Beru to wonder where he went. In reality, he had gone to the roof of one of the homestead wearing a mask and pretending he was piloting a space vehicle.\nThe next evening, Kenobi visited the Lars homestead and left a toy model of a T-16 skyhopper for Skywalker. Lars found the toy and returned it to Kenobi the next day telling him to stay away from Skywalker and that they wouldn't accept gifts from Kenobi. Kenobi tried to explain to Lars that there was more to life than just his farm and that there was a whole galaxy out there for Skywalker to explore. Despite being concerned for Skywalker, Lars accused Kenobi of only caring about his well-being only if he was showing signs of force-sensitivity. Lars refused once again to let Kenobi train Skywalker. While Obi-Wan was off-world protecting Leia, Luke did some work on Owen's speeder and accidentally broke it, so he was marched into a repair shop with Owen to have it fixed. However, the former Inquisitor Reva Sevander, blinded by rage and focusing that anger on the boy, traveled to Tatooine on the hope that killing Luke would bring her justice.\nWarned of Sevander's coming attack, Owen and Beru hid Luke inside their house and claimed that it was the Tuskens who were coming, but Sevander ultimately fought past the aunt and uncle. With Sevander in pursuit, Luke fled into the desert but was knocked out by a fall. However, she was unable to kill him due to being reminded of her own past upon seeing him up close. With Sevander returning the boy to Owen, Beru, and the suddenly-back Kenobi, who had drawn on the hope of what Luke and Leia were capable of to triumph over Vader on a barren moon before returning upon sensing that he was in danger, Luke was ushered back to the homestead by Owen and Beru. The following day, Kenobi stopped by to meet with Owen, who allowed Kenobi to finally meet the young Skywalker.\nDuring the Great Drought, henchmen for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt collected a \"water tax\" on their master's behalf. Despite the damage it caused moisture farmers, Skywalker naïvely stood up to the thugs at night, trying to take back the water they had stolen from the farmers. Kenobi, who sensed the danger his protégé was in, blew their vehicle's lights with the Force to hide his identity, and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead where he was found asleep, unaware of his savior's identity, by his aunt in the morning.\nA year after the Great Drought, life carried on for Skywalker on Tatooine. Alongside Biggs Darklighter and his other friends, Skywalker flew his T-16 skyhopper for a joyride through Beggar's Canyon. Despite some daring moves, Skywalker ended up crashing the vehicle, leading to his uncle Owen grounding him. Skywalker offered to pay for the damage by flying in a race at nearby Anchorhead, but Lars stood his ground. Unbeknownst to both of them, Obi-Wan Kenobi used Jawas to leave Skywalker some skyhopper parts. An angry Owen returned the parts to Kenobi and told him to leave the family alone.\nSome time after grounding Skywalker from flying his skyhopper, Lars attempted to rebuild his relationship with his nephew by looking to help him fix it. However, before he could, he was captured by the Wookiee bounty hunter Krrsantan and tortured. Meanwhile, Skywalker was running away from home for not the first time. However, he sensed something was wrong and rushed to his homestead. When he arrived, he found many droids destroyed and his aunt Beru rattled, telling him of the attack. She ordered her nephew to lock himself in the homestead's maintenance bay, where he found his disabled skyhopper. He proceeded to fix it and make his way to Krrsantan and Owen. As he flew there, the Wookiee was engaged by Obi-Wan Kenobi. During this battle, Owen was thrown off a cliff. Before he could hit the bottom, Skywalker, in his skyhopper, managed to catch him and escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi defeated Krrsantan. Afterwards, Skywalker was allowed to fly his skyhopper once again.\nEventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father's natural piloting skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine. At one point in his boyhood, Skywalker was climbing in a canyon, but, when he grabbed the top, the rock broke off. Skywalker fell into a cave, where he was seen by a group of womp rats and a krayt dragon, although he managed to escape the creatures. Years later, C-3PO referenced this story to several visitors. When Skywalker was 12 years old in 7 BBY, he and his friend, Windy went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and wandered away from the moisture farms riding a dewback. The two encountered a sandstorm during their time outside and both lost consciousness. A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they were saved by Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to the Lars family. Skywalker asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father. Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.\nAs more of Skywalker's friends left the planet to follow their dreams, he became increasingly frustrated that his uncle would not allow him to do the same, claiming that he still needed help with the farm. In truth, Owen was trying to prevent Skywalker from following in his father's footsteps. In 2 BBY Skywalker was helping at his foster parent's moisture farm when Beru called him inside. As Skywalker ran back to the house, he was watched in the distance by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was riding a dewback. Kenobi had just defeated and killed the former Sith apprentice Maul, who had a vendetta against Kenobi after being bisected at the torso during the Invasion of Naboo thirty years earlier. In his final moments, Maul asked Kenobi if he was guarding Skywalker. Kenobi affirmed that he believed Luke was the Chosen One before Maul passed away.\nWhen not helping his uncle, Skywalker would occasionally go bulls-eye womp rats, or go racing through the dangerous Beggar's Canyon in his T-16 skyhopper by the age of thirteen. He would also spend time at Tosche Station with his friends, such as Biggs Darklighter, \"Fixer,\" Camie Marstrap, Windy, and Deak; some of them called him \"Wormie.\" However, Luke spent most of his time working and always had to be helpful.\nIn 0 BBY, Skywalker was working on the family farm by repairing moisture vaporators with one of their WED Treadwell repair droid when he spotted a battle over Tatooine; unknown to the young man, it was the Rebel starship Tantive IV being chased by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. Heading to Tosche Station, Skywalker swapped stories with his friends, among them a visiting and recently-graduated Darklighter, who was reluctant to believe Skywalker's claims about a battle upon looking up with Skywalker's macrobinoculars and merely seeing the two craft sitting still in space. Nonetheless, Skywalker was then eager to tell his friend of his recent exploits aboard his skyhopper in Beggar's Canyon, which Darklighter was amused by. After warning his friend not to crash the ship, he leaned close to Skywalker to tell his old friend a great secret: he intended to defect from the Empire to join the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps.\nPromising to keep an eye out for him, Darklighter and Skywalker then parted ways once again with the hope that they could reunite one day. A short time later, the purchase of two droids—R2-D2 and C-3PO—by Skywalker's step-uncle changed the young farm boy's life forever. Obtaining the droids from a band of Jawas to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the droids had narrowly escaped from the battle Skywalker had glimpsed, and that R2-D2 contained a set of plans for the Empire's dreaded Death Star superweapon. While cleaning the two new droids back at the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part of a desperate message from Princess Leia Organa requesting help from someone named \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" whom R2-D2 claimed that he once belonged to.\nChasing after R2-D2 when the droid ran off to find Kenobi, Skywalker soon found himself in the company of Kenobi after being attacked by a group of Sand People out in the Jundland Wastes. After traveling back to the Jedi's home, Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a Jedi Knight who served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker's father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Darth Vader. Skywalker was also given his father's lightsaber by Kenobi, allowing the blade to be ignited for the first time in years. After he showed Princess Leia's message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old Jedi Master requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of the Force. Skywalker initially refused to get involved, as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi to Anchorhead.\nOn their way to Anchorhead, Skywalker and Kenobi came upon a group of slaughtered Jawas—the same ones who sold the droids to his uncle. Skywalker deduced from learning that Imperial stormtroopers were responsible that they might have looked into the sales records of the droids, and rushed home in the hopes of saving his step-aunt and step-uncle. Upon returning home, Skywalker discovered that he was too late: his step-aunt and step-uncle had been murdered by the Empire. With the people who raised him dead, he decided to accompany Kenobi to Alderaan to deliver the plans back to the Alliance and learn the ways of the Jedi.\nOn their way to Mos Eisley, Kenobi began training him and gave Skywalker his first lesson, during which he learned the basics of Jedi meditation. They would later reach Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where Kenobi believed that they could find a pilot that could get them to Alderaan. Inside the cantina, Skywalker nearly had a fatal run-in with the criminals Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan, but trouble was avoided when Kenobi sliced off Baba's arm with his lightsaber in defense of Skywalker.\nThe two were eventually able to find a pilot that could take them to Alderaan in the form of Han Solo, a Corellian smuggler, and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Solo's initial rate was ten thousand credits all paid in advance, which Skywalker thought was too expensive. Ultimately, they were able to compromise when Kenobi offered to pay two thousand credits up front and an additional fifteen thousand when they got to Alderaan, for a total of seventeen thousand credits, which convinced Solo to take them, with Skywalker selling his speeder to pay for the two thousand up front.\nAfter escaping stormtroopers on Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, Kenobi began Skywalker's instruction in the ways of the Force, using a training remote to instruct him in basic lightsaber combat, much to the derision of Solo, who dismissed it as a \"hokey religion.\" Wearing a helmet that completely covered his eyes for part of the lesson, Kenobi encouraged him to reach out with the Force to combat the remote. Despite his vision being totally impaired, Skywalker was able to successfully deflect a pair of blaster bolts from the remote, claiming that he could \"almost see\" the remote through the Force.\nThe lesson, however, was soon interrupted by their arrival in the Alderaan system and their discovery of the planet's destruction. They then spotted a patrolling TIE fighter and, upon following it, found that it was approaching what appeared to be a small moon, which turned out to be the Death Star. Caught by the Death Star's tractor beam, they were brought aboard the massive space station.\nOnce on board, Luke and Han knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when R2-D2 discovered that Leia Organa was being held captive on the station, Skywalker insisted on rescuing her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the detention block, Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he'd get a significant reward for doing so.\nStill using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Chewbacca to pose as a prisoner and escorted him to Detention Block AA-23  They were able to rescue Organa, but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the garbage compactor in order to escape the pursuing Imperial forces. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Chewbacca, they were able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.\nEventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with Darth Vader. Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief. Despite the fact that they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to them, so at Solo's request, Skywalker manned one of the Millennium Falcon's quad laser cannons to eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was eliminated, they traveled to the hidden rebel base on Yavin 4, unaware that the Death Star was tracking them.\nUpon their arrival at the Yavin base, they met with Commander Willard and Organa introduced him to Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a pilot. Skywalker then separated and met Wedge Antilles, who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 seconds, the more experienced pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of Antilles's, prompting Willard to accept him without objection. He joined Red Group with the designation of Red Five, which had previously belonged to a cadet named Pedrin Gaul, who had perished during the Battle of Scarif several days earlier.\nAfter the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the Falcon for rescuing Organa and prepared to leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well, Skywalker was about to board his T-65B X-wing starfighter, when he encountered his old friend Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Luke that the two would catch up on each other's stories when they got back. Skywalker was also approached by Garven Dreis, the commander of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter vouched for his friend, calling him the \"best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.\" Skywalker was assigned command of fourth flight for the battle.\nAs the Battle of Yavin got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space, Skywalker was guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He participated in Red Squadron's initial assault on the Death Star's outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station's numerous turbolaser batteries and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also helped to provide cover for Gold Squadron when they made the first attack run on the meridian trench, as well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Darth Vader himself joined the fray in a TIE Advanced x1 and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with Darklighter and Antilles.\nSkywalker took charge of the last attempt on the thermal exhaust port as instructed, but Vader and his two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter's targeting computer, much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface of Yavin 4.\nJust as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like he had the other pilots, but before he could, Han Solo and Chewbacca showed up in the Millennium Falcon, destroying Vader's two escorts and causing Vader's TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the trench. At Solo's urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two proton torpedos, using the Force to guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he, Chewbacca, and Han Solo were awarded the Medal of Bravery the next morning.\nJust as the ceremony ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of her family and homeworld. Afterwards, General Jan Dodonna sent him and Antilles, the only other survivor of Red Group, in their X-wings to retrieve the wayward princess and bring her to the Great Temple. Her shuttle's pilot, Evaan Verlaine, however, managed to outsmart them and make the jump to hyperspace with course to Naboo, with R2-D2 accompanying the two women. They would later reunite after she had successfully accomplished her mission. Soon after, Skywalker became an officer in the Alliance and was given the rank of Lieutenant and was regularly assigned numerous independent missions.\nAt some point, Luke was given a mission to analyze different worlds in search of which could host a rebel base. However, as he did so, Skywalker felt the Force drawing him to Bogano, a grassy planet in the Outer Rim Territories. As Skywalker meditated on the planet, he began to hear the voice of her friend and companion rebel Leia Organa. Luke thought the Force allowed the two to communicate across the galaxy, but Leia was behind him. Leia asked what Luke was doing there since Bogano was one of the worlds she had to check out, and Luke told the Force had taken him there. The two were taken to the Bogano Vault by a small animal. Skywalker sensed the Force was strong in the place, and while Leia thought the world might be a good base, Luke disagreed. Skywalker was apparently right, as the small animal led them to a group of stormtroopers who were dealing with animals of the same species, making it clear that the Empire knew the world. Along with Leia, Luke defeated the stormtroopers, who intended to sell the animals on the black market, and then left the planet to continue his mission to verify the planets assigned to him.\nSoon after the Battle of Yavin, in 0 ABY, Skywalker, Solo and Chewbacca were sent on a mission by Princess Organa to negotiate supplies from the planet Rion. Organa put Skywalker in charge, which surprised and peeved Solo.\nOnce arrived on the planet, Solo noticed that a big price could have been won by winning a swoop race. Skywalker, however, thought that it was better to fulfill the mission without being distracted and risking to loose money.\nSolo decided to participate anyway and, unbeknownst to his friend, took some money with which they should have bought supplies and bought a swoop. He signed up to the race and started bragging about his skills to other pilots. Two pilots, however, understood that Solo had a big bounty on his head and decided to sabotage the race and hand over the rebel soldier to the Empire.\nIn the meanwhile, Skywalker ended the negotiations with Razian, an alien that should have provided the supplies to the Rebel Alliance, but noticed that half the credits were missing. He understood that Solo took part to the race, and went to the stadium in which Solo was racing. In the stands he heard two criminals talking about how they would knock Solo out: Skywalker and Chewbacca put the two criminals out of action, and Skywalker went to help Solo who was being targeted by his opponents who agreed to eliminate him. Solo, helped by his friend, was able to win the race, and they could eventually pay Razian for the supplies.\nIn an errand for Admiral Gial Ackbar, Skywalker was dispatched to the planet Rodia in order to open a secret weapon supply line for the Alliance. He was accompanied by Artoo and a pilot named Nakari Kelen, and they flew her ship, the Desert Jewel. During their mission together, they helped a Kupohan ship—which, unknown to them at the time, carried vital intelligence on a Givin cryptographer named Drusil Bephorin—near Llanic. They then continued their journey to Rodia. Skywalker was greeted by Laneet Chekkoo, who guided him to Toopil. During business with Taneetch Soonta, the Rodian told Skywalker about the Jedi, including a story about Anakin during the Clone Wars. From her, Skywalker received her uncle's lightsaber.\nAfter killing a ghest and getting some treatment for his wounds, Skywalker focused on analyzing Huulik's lightsaber and trying to learn telekinesis, but a planetwide alert for the Desert Jewel forced him to leave Rodia immediately and meet up with Ackbar and Organa on the Promise. The two assigned him to a mission to rescue Bephorin on Denon, but the need for upgrades for the Jewel prompted him to go on another mission to Fex with Kelen before that. Warned by Organa not to blindly trust Kelen, Skywalker set off for Pasher with Kelen and Artoo to receive intel from her father about their destination and the necessary equipment to survive its atmosphere. The two then headed towards Fex. Once they successfully retrieved the Harvester and were rewarded for it, Skywalker and Kelen traveled to Rodia to fix the Desert Jewel.\nFollowing the ship's modifications, the two Rebels returned to the Promise to receive more intel on the Denon mission from Organa and Ackbar, only to depart for the planet as soon as possible, meet with their contact Sakhet, and prepare Bephorin's liberation. Once in motion, their plan allowed them to escape from Imperial Security Bureau agents, and Denon altogether, with the Givin cryptographer onboard the Jewel. Despite several hiccups along the way, including an extended stop on Kupoh, they reached Omereth. There, however, the Jewel was intercepted by bounty hunters and a confrontation ensued between the Rebels and their pursuers. Despite the formers' victory, Kelen was killed by one of the bounty hunters—saddening Skywalker, who had come to develop feelings for her. After allowing himself some time to grieve for those he had lost during the war, Skywalker completed his mission by reuniting Bephorin with her family and meeting with Major Bren Derlin. Afterwards, Skywalker returned Kelen's body to her father, after reflecting on the fact that he had learned how to move objects with the Force thanks to her support.\nAfter numerous missions alongside Antilles and earning each other's complete trust, Skywalker assisted on a mission for Red Squadron above Giju: he helped protect a transport carrying underground rebel leaders being evacuated from the planet, along with Antilles and Commander Arhul Narra. Once the package was clear, they followed the scatter protocol, and Skywalker and R2-D2 set course to Devaron when he had a vision about future events on that same planet. He soon met with Antilles and Narra, who sent him, C-3PO and R2-D2 on a mission for Chancellor Mon Mothma.\nAfter refueling the ship, the trio departed for Whiforla II and jumped out of hyperspace in the Tertiary Usaita system, but an Imperial attack forced them to return to Devaron and repair the Y 4, this time letting the Force guide him into the Temple of Eedit. Landing in Tikaroo, Skywalker left the ship for repairs with Kivas and his daughter, Farnay, using the alias \"Korl Marcus,\" and went onto the depot where he was told the Temple was off-limits; after resting and a vision of the past, he left the depot and met with Farnay, to whom he revealed his true identity. Ultimately, Sarco Plank accepted to be his guide and brought Skywalker and the two droids close to Eedit, where Skywalker found a secret entrance to the Temple and entered alone with the droids.\nDuring his stay on the Temple, Skywalker heard Kenobi's voice, from whom he received further instructions. He managed to enter a secret chamber where he and the droids found three training remotes. Using what Kenobi had taught him on the Falcon, Skywalker gradually managed to pass the exercises after a few days, only to find himself surrounded by Imperials with orders to apprehend him and his fugitive starfighter, using Farnay as a hostage. However, Plank unexpectedly appeared and helped Skywalker fight the stormtroopers with his electrostaff, and observed that Skywalker was merely a Padawan.\nPlanning to ransack the Temple to pay his debts, Plank then challenged him to a duel, during which he used a grenade to blind him, seeing that Skywalker would not be defeated so easily. Prepared to administer the coup de grace, Farnay interrupted him, for which Plank put binders on her; however, it gave Skywalker time to stand up and slash Plank's control box, casting him and his electrostaff into a pit leading to the temple's underlevels. Skywalker then passed out and Farnay tended his wounds, to whom he swore he would become a Jedi and rebuild the Order, and return to Eedit one day. With the droids, they left the Temple as Imperial reinforcements arrived afterwards. Skywalker eventually kept his promise to Farnay and returned to Devaron accompanied by C-3PO and R2-D2. While there Luke also visited the Temple of Eedit once more.\nBack in Tikaroo, Skywalker reclaimed his now-repaired starfighter from Kivas, and before departing Devaron, he dropped several bombs at the base of the spire to cut off the paths into the jungle, meaning to stop the pikhron hunt.\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker, along with R2-D2, went on a mission on the planet Hradreek to collect a credit chip. After accomplishing the mission, the Jedi felt a disturbance in the Force. He entered in a room in which many dead corpse lay, noticing that in the middle of it there was a crossguard lightsaber. Once he took the weapon, several stormtroopers entered in the room. Skywalker ignited the lightsaber and slaughtered all the Imperial troopers. After killing the last one, Skywalker was surprised by the unnatural anger that he had felt and told to R2-D2 that, during the battle, it was like he was watching without being able to stop himself, but that now he was fine.\nSoon after the fight, while he was walking down a corridor, a sudden explosion knocked him away from his astromech droid: as he stood up he tried to contact R2, but another stormtrooper squad found him and started shooting at him. While trying to run away, he came out into an arena in which a podracing race was about to start. Skywalker stole a podracer from an Er'Kit pilot and took part to the race trying to escape from the troopers. After a flight that the commentator said no one had \"ever seen anything like it\", one of the engines blew up and Skywalker found himself on foot. He ignited the red-bladed lightsaber he had found, but was able to control his anger and, to avoid it to overwhelm him again, destroyed it with his blue-bladed lightsaber. He was then rescued by an X-Wing piloted by R2-D2.\nAlongside Organa, Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO, Skywalker took part of a mission to infiltrate Cymoon 1. To do so, the rebel team hijacked the ship of an emissary sent by Jabba the Hutt to negotiate a weapons deal at Weapons Factory Alpha, with Solo as its replacement and Organa and Skywalker disguised as his bodyguards.\nOnce inside the facility, they revealed themselves as rebels to Overseer Aggadeen, took their escorts down and made their way to the central power station. While Organa, Solo, and R2-D2 rigged the place to destroy it, Skywalker watched for additional Imperial troops, using what little he knew of the Force to reach out and sense any nearby presence. However, he was drawn to caged slaves, whom he proceeded to free, and guided them to a rendezvous with Solo and Organa, when they were alerted of Vader's arrival by Chewbacca.\nDetermined to fight Vader for killing his father and Kenobi, he heard his mentor's voice speak to him from beyond, telling him to run, just as he faced the Dark Lord. However, he was no match for Vader, who quickly seized Skywalker's lightsaber and was about to kill him, until he realized that Skywalker's lightsaber had been once his own. Solo then intervened with an AT-AT, crashing the walker through the factory's walls, giving Skywalker and the slaves an opening to escape from the facility.\nSeeing so many of the freed slaves die by Imperial fire, Skywalker regretted his decision, but continued fighting after stealing a speeder bike. After the Rebels' walker opened fire against Vader, Skywalker picked his lightsaber up from the rubble, rushed to assist his team—whose walker had fallen down due to Vader—, and provided some cover fire. Determined to destroy the factory, Skywalker disobeyed Organa's orders and used his stolen speeder bike to destroy the power core despite Vader's threat. Afterwards, he managed to board the Millennium Falcon, reunite with his team and escape Cymoon 1, yet with his morale at rock bottom.\nOnce they returned to the Alliance Fleet, Skywalker continued working on his lightsaber techniques until Organa came to see him. Skywalker told her that he lacked interest in undertaking any more missions, as he did not consider himself a Jedi but a danger, and that until he could figure out who he was, he could not be around the Alliance; he asked Organa to let him go. Much to her and Solo's dismay, Skywalker  took off in an X-wing and set off on a course for Tatooine. Hoping to find some guidance in Kenobi's hut, Skywalker and R2 made their way across the desert to the abandoned residence, where they found it being pillaged by Tusken raiders, who fled in fear upon seeing his activated lightsaber.\nInside the hut, Skywalker had R2 scan the ransacked place for anything of value, and the small android came across a box addressed to Skywalker. However, before they could find out its contents, one of Boba Fett's flash grenades incapacitated R2-D2 and blinded Skywalker. Fett proceeded to aim a rifle to his head, but Skywalker fought back with his lightsaber despite his temporary blindness. Despite his disadvantage and multiple wounds done by Fett, Skywalker managed to deflect the bounty hunter's shot at point-blank and Fett tackled him in anger.\nClose to death by his own lightsaber as he struggled against Fett, R2-D2 saved him by hurling Kenobi's box and knocking the hunter out. Still blinded and carrying the box, Skywalker had R2-D2 lead him to his X-Wing. On his way to an unknown location, he read some of Kenobi's passages on his journals, including one set during the Great Drought involving him.\nThough Kenobi's journals contained a number of stories, Skywalker became frustrated as he continued to read them as he did not understand what lessons were to be learned about using a lightsaber or wielding the Force. Though Artoo suggested returning to the fleet, Skywalker had no intention of returning until he found the answers he was seeking. Artoo's suggestion did, however, give the young Jedi an idea: to venture into the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the former home of the Jedi Order. Before he could travel to Coruscant, however, Skywalker set a course to Nar Shaddaa, a world of pirates and outlaws known as the \"Smuggler's Moon.\" Upon landing, Skywalker set off looking for someone who could help him get to the Jedi Temple. He entered a cantina, where he was immediately attacked by criminals looking to rob and kill him. Skywalker brandished his lightsaber and demanded that they cease their attack, while the bartender asked where he acquired a Jedi's lightsaber. He did not answer, instead saying that he was simply on Nar Shaddaa to conduct business and had already stated his purpose for entering the establishment. The bartender guessed that Skywalker was seeking entry into the Jedi Temple, meaning he would need to hire someone who could sneak him onto the capital world of the Empire. The bartender told him that he could do that for the boy, but the price would be the lightsaber—a price that Skywalker rejected, so the bartender resorted to his previous plan of killing and robbing the boy.\nBefore the others could kill him, however, a thief stole the lightsaber and fled the bar. Skywalker gave chase, pursuing the thief through the streets and over rooftops. The thief jumped onto a ship that was passing by and hung onto the bottom of it, and Skywalker used the Force to make the now-even longer jump towards them and grab the thief's leg. The thief lost his holding and both men fell towards the streets of Hutta Town below, where Skywalker retrieved his lightsaber once both he and the thief landed. The young Jedi was then confronted by Grakkus the Hutt, a Nar Shaddaa crime lord who employed the thief that stole the lightsaber. Skywalker fought the Hutt's MagnaGuard, while at the same time overhearing the thief telling Grakkus that Skywalker said his father was a Jedi and that he was seeking access to the Jedi Temple. Having his own plans for the boy, Grakkus knocked Skywalker out with a punch to the face.\nSkywalker later awoke to find himself in Grakkus' palace, which contained untold numbers of relics from the Jedi Order. Grakkus held out a Jedi holocron, though Skywalker did not know what it was. Grakkus, who explained that he was a collector of Jedi artifacts in addition to being a crime lord, told him that the item was a holocron and that only an individual who was strong with the Force could open it. Though Skywalker had no experience with holocrons, the Hutt gave him five seconds to open the holocron or be killed. Under threat of death, the boy reached out with the Force and was able to open the holocron, as well as the many others that were in the collection. They revealed themselves as containing historical records about the Jedi and the Sith, including the revelation that there was a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. With Skywalker having proved himself, Grakkus believed he would make a fine addition to his collection as the last living Jedi. Grakkus planned to put Skywalker into an arena fight that he would bill as the death of the last Jedi, so the Hutt ordered him taken to the arena's gamemaster to be prepared. Artoo, knowing that Skywalker had been captured, send a distress call to the Alliance Fleet, where it was intercepted by the High Command. Though Chancellor Mothma was unwilling to send a team of Rebels on a suicide mission despite Skywalker's importance to the Rebellion, Chewbacca and Threepio—who remained with the fleet while Solo and Organa were on their own mission—volunteered to rescue their captured friend.\nThe gamemaster—secretly an Imperial stormtrooper named Sergeant Kreel—introduced himself to Skywalker once the Jedi was led to the arena, and he stated that it was his job to make sure Skywalker was prepared to put on a good show before ultimately dying in the arena. Though Skywalker initially refused to fight, Kreel knew he would ultimately do so because he wanted to learn to hone his skills as a Jedi. The Kreel also told him that the Jedi Temple no longer existed, as it had been converted into the Imperial Palace—so whatever Skywalker was hoping to find was gone, as were the other Jedi temples in the galaxy. He then threw the lightsaber to Skywalker and removed the binds that the boy's hands were in. While surrounded by MagnaGuards, the Kreel used a lightsaber of his own and engaged in a duel to begin preparing him for the arena match. Though the Kreel was not a Jedi, he was a more-skilled swordsman and quickly bested Skywalker. Skywalker then engaged multiple MagnaGuards in combat.\nThe big event soon arrived, and crime lords and other criminal types flocked to watch the death of the last Jedi. Skywalker spoke to Grakkus, who reminded him that no one wanted to watch him win and that everyone had paid to see him die, though the young Jedi believed he could succeed nonetheless. Grakkus also revealed that scavengers had found Skywalker's X-wing and the Journal of Ben Kenobi, which Grakkus intended to add to his collection. The event began once Grakkus left, and Skywalker entered into the arena and was introduced as the last of the Jedi. The announcer claimed that he was a veteran of battles across the galaxy and that he had fought Hutts and bounty hunters alike, hyping up the untrained Jedi hopeful. The announcer then introduced the Jedi's opponent: Kongo the Disemboweler, a large and fearsome creature from the dolovite mines of Mustafar. Skywalker ignited the green-bladed lightsaber that was given to him for the show and the fight began. The young Jedi slashed his blade at the creature, but the opponent's armor was resistant to a lightsaber blade and made it difficult for Skywalker to combat the creature. He remained confident, however, reminding himself that he blew up the Death Star, fought Boba Fett, and was trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi. He closed his eyes in an attempt to use the Force as his ally, but Kongo used the opportunity to throw Skywalker across the arena and knocking him onto the ground.\nThe beast grabbed Skywalker as the audience cheered for Kongo to make the kill, and Skywalker tried calling out to Kenobi to ask for miracle. Just as he did so, the beast's shock collar was activated by Kreel, who revealed himself to Grakkus as an Imperial and announced he was taking Skywalker into custody. Stormtroopers poured into the arena and surrounded Skywalker, arresting both him and the Hutt. Grakkus had one trick up his sleeve, though, and triggered an electromagnetic pulse that disabled the Imperials' blasters. Grakkus, skilled at combat in his own right, began fighting the weaponless stormtroopers, while other troops grabbed Skywalker. Just then, the young Jedi saw that Artoo, who had infiltrated the palace, recovered his lightsaber and threw it into the arena, so Skywalker grabbed it and cut the soldiers down. Kongo chased the spectators out of the arena, and Skywalker while Kreel confronted Skywalker, knocking him to the ground and revealing his true identity as a stormtrooper of the 501st Legion tasked with arresting him. Skywalker was saved by the timely arrival of Grakkus, who Kreel attacked as Skywalker got away.\nSkywalker regrouped with Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids, all of whom ultimately traveled to Nar Shaddaa to rescue their captive friend. Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca each wielded lightsabers that Artoo stole from the palace so they were not defenseless in the wake of the EMP blast, leading Skywalker to quip that Solo looked good with a lightsaber. Artoo recovered Kenobi's journal and Skywalker wanted to go back to the palace to recover more artifacts, but the arena was flooded with blaster-wielding stormtroopers so Chewbacca grabbed the resistant Skywalker and brought him out of the arena. The Rebels returned to the Millennium Falcon and escaped from Nar Shaddaa.\nThough he was unable to acquire the relics in Grakkus' palace, the holocrons he activated gave Skywalker one important piece of information: the existence of a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. Skywalker returned to the Alliance but still sought answers, so he traveled to Vrogas Vas and was stationed in orbit with Red Squadron, along with Blue Squadron and Yellow Squadron. While in orbit and preparing for training exercises, Darth Vader—who had learned of Skywalker's location from one of his associates, a rogue archaeologist named Aphra—dropped out of hyperspace in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Vader made quick work of Blue Squadron and Yellow Squadron, destroying them both as Red Squadron looked on. Skywalker sensed that Vader was the pilot of the enemy starfighter, made a run towards him, and crashed his X-wing fighter into the Sith Lord's TIE Advanced. The collision damaged both vessels and send them hurtling towards the surface of Vrogas Vas.\nSkywalker and Vader both survived the crashes of their starfighters, though they impacted on the surface in different places. The young Jedi crashed outside of the ruins of the Jedi Temple, from which he witnessed the destruction of Gray Squadron forces sent to attack Vader—part of a major Rebel operation to capture the lone Sith Lord. He put off his search for answers and began to make his way towards the Rebel forces, determined to help his friends. As he passed through the ruins of the Jedi Temple, he could see yet another Rebel pilot being killed by the Dark Lord. Unknown to Skywalker was that, at the same time, he was being tracked by Vader's companions—Aphra and the assassin droids BT-1 and 0-0-0. While the Sith Lord's followers prepared a plan to capture the boy, Skywalker found writings in the ruins that were written with a lightsaber, letting him deduce that the ruins were from the Jedi. A cold feeling passed over him and he could sense the presence of what he thought was Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. He tried to concentrate, but he was interrupted by what he thought was Threepio's arrival. In reality, it was Triple-Zero, painted in gold by Aphra, who placed his metal hand on Skywalker and sent an electrical charge through the boy's body, knocking him unconscious.\nAphra and Triple-Zero prepared to take Skywalker hostage when Artoo stepped in to help. Bee Tee then brought his arsenal to bear on the rebel's astromech and chased him off. Aphra and Triple-Zero then seized Skywalker but were stopped by the smuggler Han Solo, who had a sniper rifle aimed at them. Chewbacca then came in and attacked the protocol droid, ripping his arm off. Skywalker then regained consciousness, dispatched Bee Tee, and sliced off Triple-Zero's other arm with his lightsaber. Skywalker and his allies then retreated when Bee Tee fired his weapons blindly.\nSkywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, and Artoo made their way back to the Millennium Falcon. They then lifted off in order to aid princess Leia. They were forced to the ground when their ship was crashed into by the Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan. While Solo and Chewbacca dealt with the mercenary, Skywalker left to head back to the Jedi ruins.\nLuke arrived back at the the Jedi temple looking for Leia. It was then that he heard the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who told him that he should not have come to this place and that he was not ready for what is coming. Luke was then intercepted by a company of stormtroopers who opened fire on him. He retreated behind cover but was hit in the head and knocked unconscious.\nLuke was taken prisoner by the forces of Commander Karbin. However Darth Vader, who had a rivalry with Karbin, used the force to crash the shuttle Skywalker was kept in. Now free, he then caught up with Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2. They made their way back to the Millennium Falcon, however Dr. Aphra had laid out a minefield to stop them. When she was distracted she was knocked out from behind by Princess Leia. Believing her to be of use, Organa decided to take the archaeologist with them. As they departed Vrogas Vas, Skywalker felt remorse that he would not be able to go back to the temple and see what was hidden there.\nUpon returning to the Rebel fleet with their new prisoner, Doctor Aphra, Skywalker and his friends went their separate ways; Organa, Artoo, and Threepio went to detain Aphra at an Alliance-controlled space station, Sunspot Prison, with the assistance of Sana Starros, whom Organa hired to transport them to the prison. Meanwhile, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion. Solo attempted to double the money he was given for supplies by betting on sabacc. However, he was caught cheating, and had to escape with Skywalker on the Millennium Falcon.\nSkywalker and Solo traveled to Nar Shaddaa where Luke was tasked with finding a customer in need of a ship. He made a deal to haul nerfs to Ibaar for 5,000 credits, which was just enough to replace the credits lost by Solo. Skywalker and Solo were soon intercepted by TIE fighters who suspected the Falcon of smuggling illegal livestock. Luke was able to shoot the fighters and he and Solo made it to Ibaar with the nerfs. While on Ibaar, Skywalker blackmailed Solo into allowing him to fly the Falcon for a few parsecs by threatening to tell Leia about losing the credits in a Sabacc game.\nAfter buying the supplies, Skywalker and Solo received a distress call from Sana and arrived at Sunspot Prison. They were immediately knocked out and taken captive by the masked assailant who was attacking the prison. Neither came to until after the battle had already ended and the attacker had been captured.\nSometime after the assault on Sunspot Prison, the Alliance established a temporary outpost on the Outer Rim planet Reamma. Organa gave Luke a mission to find a missing Alliance cargo vessel. Skywalker and R2-D2 prepared to make the flight to look for them. Before they could do that, however, Organa informed Skywalker that the vessel reported in, cancelling the mission.\nSometime later, Skywalker and Organa rendezvoused with rebel leadership. Admiral Ackbar, General Dodonna, and Mon Mothma presented them with the task of providing aid to the people of Tureen VII, a planet that had provided aid to the rebellion in the past. A heavily blockaded planet with Imperial bases on both of its moons and swarms of TIE fighters in orbit, the Alliance could not risk sending the fleet. Luke and Leia proposed stealing an Imperial Star Destroyer and using it to infiltrate the blockade. Despite some reluctance from Dodonna, Ackbar and Mothma realized that it was the only choice left.\nAfer the hijacking of the Harbinger, Leia ended up grievously injured on the planet Skorii-Lei. Cared for by former engineer Pash Davane and carrying vital Alliance information, Organa was pursued by stormtroopers and barely managed to escape aboard the Millennium Falcon with Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca. Aboard the Falcon, Davane provided Skywalker with Leia's data tape, which he noted was a sign of great trust between the two of them. With her place as a friend of the Alliance confirmed, Skywalker and his allies returned Davane to her home on Skorii-Lei.\nDespite the escape from the Harbinger, the heroes quickly realized that C-3PO was captured during the commotion, and Skywalker was unable to stop R2-D2 from commandeering an X-Wing to rescue the protocol droid on his own. With his own X-wing's hyperdrive temporarily disabled, he resumed reading Ben Kenobi's journal. Identifying a symbol in the journal as a star map, Skywalker decided to visit the Vagadarr system after reading of a Jedi Master who had ventured there in the past and encountered enormous giants made of living stone that gave those in close proximity a power known as Stonepower. Skywalker hoped that going there would give him the knowledge he needed to save R2-D2 and C-3PO.\nLike the Jedi Master before him, Skywalker was able to navigate through the planet's heavy debris field and land on the surface, where he encountered Garro, the last remaining native human, who initially wanted to use Skywalker's life force to kill the few remaining giant children. Determined to protect them, Skywalker inspired Garro to change his mind and sacrifice his own life force to revive a dead giant. Skywalker and the giant children then ventured into the giant's cave to find the heart of the mountain and finish what Garro started in reviving the giant, thus completing the mission of the Master from years past and taking another step in his journey to becoming a Jedi.\nSometime later, as the Alliance was setting up a temporary outpost on Horox III, Skywalker went to a local bar. Threatened by its denizens, he defended himself alongside Doctor Aphra and Black Krrsantan, who had lied to Sana Starros in order to find Skywalker. Claiming to know where to find a Jedi Master, Aphra convinced an initially hesitant Luke to visit the Screaming Citadel with her. While on the way, she introduced him to the Rur crystal of the ancient Jedi splinter group known as the Ordu Aspectu. Aphra claimed that introducing him to the Queen of Ktath'atn as a Jedi would allow them to reactive that crystal. At Ktath'atn, the entire party, except for Krrsantan were allowed into the citadel. Aphra presented Luke to the Queen who, unbeknownst to them, planned on eating Skywalker.\nHaving been selected by the Queen from a group of other creatures of interest, Doctor Aphra and Skywalker ate in a dining hall with the monarch. The Queen commanded Luke to move a nearby dining tray with the Force, though he was unable to until the Queen's servant, Vespinax, threatened him with a knife to his throat. Moving the tray revealed to the duo that the Queen planned on implanting them with an Abersyn symbiote, so they quickly made an attempt to escape. In the Citadel's hallway, they were nearly stopped by many of the Queen's thralls.\nBefore Luke needed to use his lightsaber to defend them, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Sana Starros arrived at their location on Aphra's ship, the Ark Angel II, with her droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 in tow. Starros attempted to shoot Aphra, but Skywalker blocked the blast with his lightsaber, claiming that she was his friend. Meanwhile, the Queen's servants and armed security guards pursued the group, so they escaped into an Abersyn symbiote laboratory. Aphra led Luke to a nearby room and sold him out to the Queen of Ktath'atn, who promptly enthralled him. Rather than infect him with an Abersyn symbiote, the Queen connected Luke to a machine that would allow her to directly feed on him. Solo attempted to rescue him, but was quickly enthralled and forced to lead the Queen's forces. In an ensuing struggle, Skywalker managed to re-arm himself with his lightsaber and fell under the influence of an Abersyn symbiote, becoming more powerful than even the Queen, and proclaimed himself King of the hive.\nDoctor Aphra, deciding to return to save Luke, allowed Eternal Rur to enter his mind to assist him. Rur advised Luke to use the symbiote to his advantage, claiming that tying the Force's abilities into the parasite's emotional drive would make him immensely powerful. Choosing to ignore Rur, Luke let go, connected to the Force, and was able to free himself of the symbiote's influence and strike down the Queen. Han and all those under the Queen's control were freed, and the Citadel was destroyed by BT-1. Reuniting with his friends, Luke told Aphra to stay away from them. Afterwards, the rebels and Aphra's crew escaped and went their separate ways.\nSkywalker later took part in a mission with Leia, piloting a Taylander shuttle with the princess. With Imperial TIE Fighters in pursuit, Skywalker was forced to fly into a nebula, which disabled the shuttle's systems, forcing them to crash land on an ocean planet. Stranded on the planet for three weeks, Skywalker's experience with machinery, such as moisture vaporators helped keep himself and Leia alive. Having to live off of the land, the two grew closer, relating to each other because of their status as orphans. They eventually realized that there was a native species living in the planet's ocean. Not wanting to bring the war to these people, Skywalker and Organa set a trap for the Imperial forces that were pursuing them. Luke used the native's resources, as well as his own lightsaber, to fend off an AT-AT and shoretroopers. Although close to being defeated, Leia used a flaming arrow to light explosive chemicals and disable the AT-AT. Afterwards, they were able to repair the shuttle and return to the Rebel Fleet.\nShortly afterward, Skywalker and his team intercepted a message from R2-D2, who had successfully rescued C-3PO from Imperial capture. They saved R2's X-wing from Darth Vader and escaped in hyperspace.\nBy then, Task Force 99 had destroyed the Horox III rebel outpost. The team arrived there, discovering the devastation. Fearing further danger, they left without burying the rebel troopers, but Skywalker insisted that they honor the dead. Together they built a cremation pile before leaving.\nHaving traveled throughout the galaxy with his friends, Luke and his fellow rebels journeyed to what remained of the moon Jedha, the site of one of the Death Star's tests. On the ashy moon, Luke and Leia defended what remained of Saw Gerrera's Partisans from invading snowtroopers and brought them aboard the Millennium Falcon. Moving to NaJedha, the planet that Jedha orbitted, Luke met Chulco Gi, an aspirant to the Disciples of the Whills, someone wou could potentially guide him in learning about the Force. Gi led the rebels to the rest of the Partisans on Jedha and placed hoods over their heads, in keeping with Partisan tradition. Led by Benthic, Saw Gerrera's former second-in-command, the remaining extremists held guns at their fellow rebels' heads.\nBenthic questioned why the Alliance would attempt to mend their relations with the Partisans and return to Jedha, and Leia revealed that the Empire had resumed mining Kyber crystals on the planet and that the Alliance hoped to aid the Partisans in fighting against the Empire. Though wary of Alliance support, Benthic was nonetheless willing to accept some aid. Luke, shaken by the Partisans' extreme methods, was conflicted by agreeing to help them, but specforces operative Ubin Des reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Later in the ruined settlement of Ai-jed, Luke, Chulco, and Ubin contemplated why people would stay on a ruined planet. Stormtroopers armed with flamethrowers attempted to incinerate the remaining civilians, but Luke lashed out against them with his lightsaber, cutting them all down. Realizing all that was at stake in the Galactic Civil War, Skywalker approached Benthic with Han Solo and wholeheartedly agreed to assist him in his fight. Their first target was the drill citadel, a mining device from the planet Shu-Torun that the Empire began using to mine Kyber crystals on Jedha.\nBenthic and Luke scaled the drill citadel and the Tognath ruthlessly killed the station's guards, much to Skywalker's chagrin. Benthic held a technician at gunpoint and forced him to lower the citadel's shields before killing him as well. This allowed Han Solo, aboard the Millennium Falcon, to destroy the drill citadel after Benthic and Luke escaped. Later, a disillusioned Chulco asked Luke to accompany him to meet the Central Isopter, a death-worshipping cult that Gi claimed was wise in the Force. Although Luke was hesitant to seek the guidance from someone other than a disciple of the Jedi, he nonetheless was willing to go along. Leia attempted to convince him that his duty to the Alliance was most important, but Luke believed that becoming a Jedi and avenging all those slain by Darth Vader was the most important duty to him. Entering a chasm alongside Gi, the duo were attacked by a sand slug, a giant, normally herbivorous animal negatively influenced by the Dark Side of the Force. Able to slay the beast, Skywalker and Gi were finally confronted by the Central Isopter, who claimed that they had come to join them \"in the shadow of death.\"\nAt the edge of the planet's blast crater, Chulco and the Central Isopter presented Luke with the Temple of Central Isopter, a shrine surrounded by the Dark Side of the Force. The cult implored Skywalker and Gi to meditate and listen to the chasm's call. They both did, but Luke refused to let the Dark Side take hold of him. However, Chulco was possessed by the darkness and attacked Luke, forcing the Jedi trainee to strike him down. The cultists then announced that they had received a distress call from Chewbacca, who was being pursued by a TIE fighter over NaJedha. Luke borrowed a ship, was able to destroy the TIE fighter and bring an injured Chewie to the planet, where he provided the Alliance with the plans for the Leviathan, a mobile fortress able to strip mine Kyber crystals from Jedha.\nHan, Leia, and Benthic formed a strategy to destroy the Leviathan using the plans Chewbacca obtained. After the meeting, Luke ruminated on the sacrifice Rogue One made to get the Death Star plans to the Alliance, ultimately leading to him making the shot that destroyed the battle station. A newly motivated Luke accompanied Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 aboard the crawler and readied themselves for taking control of it. Skywalker made his way to the bridge of the Leviathan and held its commander, Kanchar, hostage but the Imperial's cybernetic arm was equipped with a blade able to defend against Luke's lightsaber.\nKanchar pursued Luke throughout the ship with his cybernetic arm's blade and flamethrower. Eventually leading the officer to the crawler's hangar, Skywalker activated an ion torpedo, which shut down Kanchar's cybernetics and allowed Luke to knock him out. Having taken total control of the Leviathan with the help of the double-crossing Queen Trios, the rebels brought it to Jedha's chasm, destroye it, and escaped with not much time to spare. Having saved what remained of Jedha and made allies in the form of the Partisans and Queen Trios, Luke and his friends left Jedha.\nAt some point Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, were sent by the Alliance to investigate the planet Lotho Minor for a new base. During the investigation, they ran into native droids and a male Duros named Akar Duel.\nWith the help of the droids Teetee and Doc, along with the arrival of C-3PO aboard the Millennium Falcon, the droids fought back against Duel and were freed from him. Their actions made the group leave Lotho Minor however, believing that the planet was not a good location for a new rebel base.\nFollowing the attack on the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Skywalker was promoted to the rank of commander. After being promoted, Skywalker was sent to the desert world of Er'Kit, where the locals were being oppressed by a group of mercenaries known as the Malachor Company. Upon arriving on the desert world, Skywalker sensed through the Force that there was something more at play beyond the actions of a few mercenaries. He requested the assistance of an agent who had a reputation for desert warfare and, together, the two defeated the mercenary outposts. The two also discovered from Imperial operatives in the sector that Imperial supplies were being ferried from Nar Shaddaa to Er'Kit, suggesting a large-scale operation was under way. Eventually, Skywalker and the agent arrested the mercenary leader and tracked down the last members of Malachor Company, who had holed up in an empty village.\nAmong the mercenaries' possessions, Skywalker and the agent discovered a document proving that Malachor Company was preparing to ship supplies somewhere, and its coordinates led Skywalker and the agent to an Imperial base on the planet. They subsequently attacked several Imperial bases until they found intelligence pertaining to the Empire's operation on the planet. Once they located the base from which the Imperials deployed most of their forces on the planet, Skywalker assaulted it with the assistance of Princess Organa. The Rebels razed the base, dealing an important blow to the Empire's operations on Er'Kit, but they still lacked vital information on what the Empire's true purpose was on the planet. Skywalker gradually discovered Imperial logs detailing how Malachor Company had been hired by the Imperial Security Bureau and were tasked with forcibly relocating natives to make room for Project Hidden Eye. This ISB operation was intended to create cybernetic sleeper agents who could be deployed throughout the galaxy and spy on galactic citizens on behalf of the ISB. Upon its discovery, Project Hidden Eye was nearly ready to deploy its first wave of spies.\nTo prevent the operation from being carried out, Skywalker and the agent led their troops to the base that housed Project Hidden Eye. They fought through its staging area and ultimately took out the installation, ending the Imperial project for good. Skywalker thanked the agent for their service and then remained on Er'Kit for a short time, helping the Rebel Alliance execute additional missions on the desert world.\nFollowing their mission to Shu-Toran, Skywalker, along with Solo and Organa, returned to the Rebel fleet where General Carlist Rieekan assigned Skywalker a mission to the Inner Rim planet Sergia to lure all Imperial forces and probe droids from a refueling station the Rebel Alliance had established on the planet.\nWhen Skywalker arrived, he found that the rebels were operating out in the open, and sent R2-D2 to deliver a message to the rebels to lie low until he could help them to escape. After a distraction by Skywalker, the rebels were able to evacuate and also take along the thief Warba Calip with them.\nIn 3 ABY, Skywalker and the Rogue Squadron were transferred to the Echo Base, a rebel base on the iced planet Hoth, where he participated in regular patrols of the frozen perimeter under the callsign Echo Three.\nWhile the base was still being built, two rebel soldiers, Kes Dameron and his wife, Shara Bey found themselves trapped after an ice collapse caused by A-Wing cannon. Thinking they would have died, they recorded a message for their little son, Poe Dameron to explain why they joined the Rebellion. Skywalker, however, rescued them, helped by Chewbacca by opening a hole in the ice using his lightsaber. Dameron and Bey were eventually treated by a 2-1B-series medical droid.\nSome time later, while reconnoitering the surroundings of Echo Base on the tauntaun Riba, after Solo had departed back to base, Skywalker was attacked by a wampa, only to regain consciousness in its cave. He severed its arm with his lightsaber and escaped; after a long walk in the icy wind, he collapsed from exhaustion. Near death, he had a vision of Kenobi, who told him to seek the teachings of Yoda in the Dagobah system.\nRescued by Solo, Skywalker recovered from his wounds in a bacta tank operated by the medical droids 2-1B and FX-7. However, Vader had located Echo Base with one of his probe droids and prepared an imminent attack on the recently-opened Alliance base, thus prompting the Alliance to evacuate the base at once. After bidding farewell to his friends, for the impending battle, Skywalker was to lead Rogue Squadron in an airspeeder. Before he departed to the battlefront, he was spotted by rebel journalist Corwi Selgrothe, who wanted to quickly interview him for propaganda footage, but she was instead led to the escape transports by rebel trooper L'cayo Llem. During the battle, Skywalker led his speeders against the walkers, ordering Rogue Squadron to pull the AT-ATs down with tow tables after realizing their armor could resist their blasters. Though he was shot down, and his gunner Dak Ralter was killed, he got out of his damaged speeder and single-handedly destroyed walker Blizzard 4 with his lightsaber and a thermal detonator. As Imperial forces breached the Rebels' defenses, the last Rebel transport departed, and Skywalker fled the planet aboard his X-wing with R2-D2.\nSkywalker then traveled to Dagobah, which turned out to be a remote swamp planet, where he encountered Yoda, the former Grand Master of the fallen Jedi Order. In their initial meeting, Skywalker was frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Yoda, who did not initially identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker's patience, telling him a story about three brothers, and taking him back to his hut to partake in a meal of rootleaf stew, which he did not find very appetizing.\nHowever, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Yoda agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi's spirit. Skywalker's training proved to be difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.\nSkywalker's training on Dagobah lasted several weeks, with Kenobi needing to appear in Yoda's dreams more than once to convince the old master to keep up Luke's training and argue that the boy would not end up like this father. When Skywalker and Yoda argued, Kenobi also regularly appeared to stop their arguments. One day during his training with Yoda, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Yoda decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.\nWhen Yoda asked him to enter a cave that was strong in the dark side in which he was supposed to find only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing the armor of Darth Vader, meant to symbolize his inner darkness. Master and apprentice then had an encounter with a raging elephoth, which Skywalker managed to calm by leading her to her child.\nShortly after, he had a vision of Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering at Cloud City on Bespin. Unable to get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Yoda and Kenobi's insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that he'd learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy of the Empire.\nSeeing that Skywalker's mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Yoda advised him to mind what he'd learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his training.\nUpon his arrival at Cloud City's East Platform, Skywalker felt Vader's presence, and went into the nearest building, where he was shot at by Fett, who had come to claim a bounty put on Solo by Jabba the Hutt, and tried to pursue a group of stormtroopers and Imperial officers who held Organa, Chewbacca, and C-3PO captive. The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path was diverted to the carbon-freezing chamber where Darth Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze him in carbonite to present him to the Emperor. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce lightsaber duel.\nDuring the duel, Vader praised Skywalker's training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but Skywalker leapt out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.\nThe duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City's gas-processing vanes. Vader began using the Force to throw various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation port. The chamber was quickly depressurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk overlooking the reactor shaft. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk's railing and pull himself up.\nVader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed as Obi-Wan Kenobi had been. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off his right hand. Both Skywalker's hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.\nSeeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of the dark side and complete his training, but Skywalker adamantly refused to ever join Vader, the man who had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that he was his father.\nHorrified by Vader's shocking revelation, Skywalker initially denounced the Sith Lord's claim as untrue and impossible, but Vader insisted that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader further claimed that Skywalker was powerful enough to destroy the Emperor, and when he did, they could rule the galaxy together as father and son. Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to grab onto a weather vane to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever, especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in desperation, he called out to Leia Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.\nSoon, the Millennium Falcon, with Lando Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids onboard, arrived to rescue him. As they escaped from Bespin, and the Falcon was faced with the Imperial fleet, Vader reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him \"son.\" Skywalker fought tears back, after hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the truth, just as the Falcon made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2.\nHaunted by the truth of his parentage, Skywalker found his connection to the Force considerably weakened, with his control over it remaining sporadic. Aboard the Falcon, Organa informed him of what had happened to Solo. Skywalker wanted to begin searching for his friend immediately, but Organa told him that there was more at stake than just Solo's life and it would be best to reconvene with the Rebel fleet first. With Skywalker agreeing to this plan, the Falcon jumped to hyperspace.\nThe Falcon arrived at the Rebellion's Rendezvous Point Delta-Three in the Mid Rim to find the fleet's Fourth Division under attack from several Star Destroyers, including the Tarkin's Will, which was under the leadership of Commander Ellian Zahra. As the Falcon entered the battle, Skywalker volunteered to commandeer the ship's belly gun, despite his injuries. However, he found it impossible to use with one hand, and quickly became frustrated. His anger resulted in him unknowingly using the Force to make several of the attacking TIE Fighters crash into one another. With Luke stunned by his sudden show of strength, the fleet jumped to hyperspace.\nWith the fleet regrouped, Skywalker found a deserted part of the flagship and attempted to contact Yoda through the Force. Angry at the Jedi Master's refusal to answer, he almost shattered one of the ship's windows in another frustration-fueled loss of control over his Force abilities. He wondered whether the lack of answers from his mentors signified a premature end to his Jedi training, and who he was meant to be if not a Jedi.\nOrgana told Skywalker that he should have a prosthetic hand installed in the Nebulon-B frigate Redemption's medbay. Although unsure whether it would help his mental state, Skywalker agreed, and received the hand as Calrissian and Chewbacca set out to find Solo.\nUpon their return, Calrissian found Skywalker training to fire a blaster with his prosthetic hand. Observing the would-be Jedi's struggles, Calrissian suggested that they return to Bespin so as to retrieve Skywalker's lightsaber. As they talked, Skywalker was suddenly confronted with a vision of a female hooded figure catching his lightsaber and telling him to follow his destiny.\nSkywalker, accompanied by Calrissian, Organa, and R2-D2, returned to Bespin, where they were fired upon the Bespin Wing Guard. Fortunately, Calrissian was able to remotely disable the city's turrets, but the team were soon ambushed by stormtroopers upon landing. Needing to carry out their missions as quickly as possible to avoid capture, the rebels split up, with Skywalker and R2-D2 heading to the smelting chamber where Calrissian claimed his lightsaber should be located.\nHowever, Skywalker found mountains of debris in the chamber and realized that it would be impossible to recover his lightsaber. Sensing that Organa was in trouble, he abandoned the search and found Calrissian surrounded by stormtroopers. Skywalker used the Force to push the Imperial soldiers through a window, telling Calrissian that he did not need the lightsaber to be a Jedi. Together, they rescued Organa and several Cloud City citizens and escaped, with Skywalker stealing his X-wing back. He temporarily parted ways with the other rebels, flying off in search of the woman from his vision.\nHaving used the planet he saw in his vision as the basis for his search, Skywalker arrived at the planet Serelia, where he encountered the woman from the vision at a dock on the coastline. However, when he asked whether she was a Jedi, the woman responded by dropping a large amount of fish on top of him and escaping in a boat. Undeterred, Skywalker gave chase but ended up capsizing the boat, washing ashore on a beach. He followed the woman into a cave, where he was almost killed by several booby traps and eventually fell into a cage that was gradually filling with water. As the woman watched, Skywalker attempted hold back the rising water with the Force, but was unable. The hooded woman asked him who he was and revealed herself to be Verla.\nVerla informed Skywalker that it would be safer if he was to give up his dream of becoming a Jedi, cynically telling him about Order 66, the Inquisitorius and Darth Vader himself. Sensing Skywalker's suspicious reaction to the mention of his father, Verla probed deeper into his mind and realized that he was the son of Vader. She increased the flow of water in the cage, attempting to drown him.\nFortunately, Skywalker's life was saved by R2-D2, who incapacitated Verla and resuscitated him. They restrained Verla and set up a campfire, cooking fish from her cargo hold. When she regained consciousness, Skywalker freed her as a show of good faith and asked her about his vision. Verla told him that she did not possess a lightsaber, as she had given up on the Force and refused to take part in the conflict between the light and dark sides. Although she strongly recommended that Skywalker should leave the Force behind, she informed him of a Jedi outpost from the High Republic Era on the Outer Rim astronomical object of Tempes.\nSkywalker flew to Tempes and was almost struck down by the planet's powerful lightning storm. He managed to outmaneuver the lightning and land safely, venturing into the outpost. Inside, he found a new yellow-bladed lightsaber but was attacked by the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor, who had been forced to guard the outpost for eternity by Vader. The Inquisitor taunted the young Jedi's skill with a lightsaber, but Skywalker was able to over power him and escape before Vader arrived.\nSkywalker returned to the Rebel fleet and reunited with Organa. Organa implored him to show the assorted rebels what he had found, and so Skywalker activated his new lightsaber, its yellow blade representing renewed hope for the future of the Rebellion.\nThe Empire's Commander Ellian Zahra intercepted a transmission that revealed the Alliances Fourth and Seventh Divisions were planning to rendezvous somewhere in the Inner Rim, so Zahra initiated an attack that saw her split her forces to strike simultaneously. Zahra's primary strike force led an attack on the Alliance's Seventh Division, while her secondary strike force attempted to attack Leia Organa's Fourth Division, however the Fourth had already left their rendezvous point before the strike force arrived. The Imperial forces overwhelmed the Seventh Division's capital ships. TIE interceptors created a blockade of Home One's hangar bay, that prevented Alliance starfighters from launching, including Red Squadron.\nShortly into the battle, the Fourth Division's ships emerged from hyperspace and immediately deployed their starfighters, led by Commander Luke Skywalker, who assumed the callsign Red Leader. Skywalker was accompanied by other starfighters, that included Green Squadron's Shara Bey , along with Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon. Skywalker called for all Fourth Division fighters to form up on him, on an attack run on Home One's blockade, to push the TIEs back, while those starfighters who were trapped in the hangar bays prepared to launch, including Wedge Antilles . As soon as Skywalker cleared the TIEs, all the Alliance starfighters aboard Home One launched to repay the favor. Skywalker then left the space battle to board the frigate where Leia Organa was under attack from an Imperial boarding party, led personally by Zahra.\nLuke, C3PO and Chewbacca went to Nar Shaddaa in order to get a clue to where Fett was, but they ended up being ambushed by some armed thugs and quickly escaped thanks to Luke deflecting their blaster shots.\nThey met up with Leia who told them that Fett didn't have Han anymore and that the captain was going to be sold in a auction in from of most crime syndicates on Jekara. Luke tried to convince Leia to rethink the mission after finding out a powerful criminal organization named Crimson Dawn was behind the auction, but she refused.\nSkywalker accompanied Starlight Squadron when they received a broken transmission from the Eleventh Division of the Rendezvous Point Lambda-Four at Ab Dalis who were being attacked by Imperial forces. Starlight Squadron arrived at the rendezvous point and shoot a dormant volcano on the planet that destroyed the Star Destroyer that attacked the Eleventh Division.\nAfter the saving the division, Luke went to Jekara in order to help Leia and the others rescue Han, but he also had a vision of Vader arriving which made him panic as he couldn't believe he could beat him. Leia asked look for help in distracting Vader when the Sith Lord arrived at the auction, but he was occupied dealing with an Imperial Executor that was over Jekara, Luke fought off various TIE fighters and made them it the hull of one of the crime syndicates present at the auction, which made them retaliate against the Empire. As Luke arrived on Jekara, the Imperials established a secure channel between him and Vader, who threaten to kill the frozen Han if he didn't arrive to face him.\nLuke opted to fly away in order to get Vader to follow him, during their chase, Skywalker used the Polar Sea of Jekara to trap Vader's TIE on the ice. Vader fired at Skywalker and made Luke crash back down onto the planet below. Thankfully, Vader was ordered by the Emperor to assist with a Hutt attack that was happening against the empire, which forced the Sith Lord to leave his son behind, not before reminding Luke that he was no Jedi. During his confrontation with Vader, Leia and the rest failed to rescue Han Solo, who was captured by Boba Fett once again after the auction.\nAfter the breakout of the Syndicate War, the Rebel Alliance had a meeting with many of its leaders that Luke Skywalker was present for. As Admiral Ackbar discussed the Alliance's next moves in its rebuilding effort, Leia Organa noticed that Skywalker was distant. He explained that R2-D2 had given him a list of possible Jedi sites across the galaxy from an Imperial archive. Hee expressed that he knew he was needed by the Alliance, but that he felt like he should be trying to continue growing as a Jedi. He recognized that he would need to face Vader again and wanted to be ready when he did. Organa told him that it was okay and that he should trust what the Force was telling him, offering to smooth things over with Mon Mothma and telling him that they could fight the battles without him for now.\nSkywalker consulted R2-D2 for the list of Jedi sites and worried that since it was an imperial list all of the places would have been destroyed or looted. But he recognized that he needed to keep going if he was going to face Vader, though he wished Master Yoda would talk to him. Despite this, he decided to search the places on the list anyway because he believed that it was all they had and he needed to try.\nHe visited the planet Ilum first and discovered the mass imperial blockade and presence there and the Empire's exploitation of the planet. He felt in the Force that the planet was important, but also felt that now only held pain as the Empire was killing it more and more every day. He believed there was nothing for him there and he and R2-D2 used the weather of the planet to leave and slip past the blockade. He visited Arashar next, but only orbited it as it had a massive orbital Imperial presence and he didn't think he could get by it. He then visited Lothal, and traveled to the former location of the Lothal Jedi Temple. He could feel that it needed to be opened with the Force, but it didn't respond to him and felt like it had been buried or locked. This discouraged him, making him feel like he still didn't know a lot of things.\nHe finally traveled to the river moon of Al'doleem and decided to visit it because it didn't have an Imperial blockade and wasn't being destroyed. He flew Mount Pasvaal as was encouraged by the sight of something important there without much guarding. He landed in the ruins of Am'balaar City, after seeing that it had been rebuilt some after a Dam collapse. He told R2-D2 that they would head into town, but he didn't want to draw attention as one of the Empire's biggest targets. He walked up to two stormtroopers and tried to perform a Jedi mind trick on them that Yoda had taught him and he had seen Obi-Wan Kenobi do, asking the troopers to tell him what the Empire was doing at the top of the mountain, but the mind trick failed and the troopers merely told him to move along.\nSkywalker and R2-D2 aimlessly wandered the city until R2 noticed a hull panel from a Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor and stopped him. Skywalker didn't understand until a man named Colli walked out and told Skywalker that he was surprised he didn't know but bet he had other people fix his starships. Colli explained that the Jedi flew Delta-7 Aethersprites in the Clone Wars. Colli told Skywalker to come inside, as he had noticed the lightsaber on his belt, and warned that if he had others might have too. Colli asked him if he was really a Jedi, to which Skywalker explained that he was trying to be. Colli told him that he had known a Jedi named Kirak Infil'a who had worked in the monastery on top of Mount Pasvaal and had allowed him and his sister to escape in his Aetherspire when the city was attacked and destroyed. He explained that both Infil'a and his parents had died. Colli asked Skywalker about his story, but R2-D2 tried to stop him from saying anything. Colli insisted that he wasn't going to turn them into the imperials and that helping Skywalker would probably be the closest he could get to repaying his debt to the Jedi that saved him. Skywalker said that he needed to learn as much about the Jedi as he could from what of their legacy remained and that he believed the mountain that Infil'a had come from was connected to the Order and that he wanted to figure out what the Empire was looking for there.\nColli took Skywalker to the Monastery at the top of the mountain, but explained that there were also tunnels and chambers in the mountain that the Jedi had used and that the Empire was bringing artifacts out of it all the time. Skywalker considered using his lightsaber and the Force to let go and cut right through the Imperial forces in his way, but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead gave his lightsaber to R2 for safekeeping. He went and meditated with the Force on the side of the mountain before returning to the warehouse where Colli had told him the Empire stored the artifacts they found in the mountain. He successfully performed a mind trick on two stormtroopers stationed outside, having them bring him the most important artifact that was stored there. They brought him a holocron, which Luke recognized from his experience with Grakkus the Hutt. He reached out with the Force to unlock it as he had learned how to do and found a recording of Master Yoda teaching lessons. Skywalker was disappointed, however, that the lesson Yoda taught in the holocron was one that he had already taught him back on Dagobah. Burdened by the series of setbacks he had faced recently, Skywlaker considered dropping the holocron off of a cliff, but was stopped by R2. Skywalker opened the holocron again, and this time Yoda discussed Vergences in the Force, listing the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Jedha, and the Living Sea of Gazian as examples. Luke had never heard of the Living Sea of Gazian and decided to go to the planet to check it out.\nArriving in the Gazian system, Luke was excited by the possibility of finding a Jedi-related site that the Empire did not know about. He landed on a platform he found on the planet, but was disappointed to only find a sea of mushrooms. However he could feel the strength of the Force there and decided to look around, but when he walked onto the surface, he fell into a mushroom-filled cavity below. His breath mask was pulled off of him and he went unconscious, starting to have a vision where he was wearing the clothes he wore during the Duel on Cloud City and was in possession of the Skywalker lightsaber. He then saw a man in High Republic Era Jedi robes sitting next to him, who then took the Skywalker lightsaber with Force and admired it, comparing it to his own. Skywalker held up a blaster and told the man to give it back. He acquiesced but commented that he wasn't scared of the blaster. The man introduced himself as Jedi Master Elzar Mann. He asked Skywalker if he was a Jedi, to which Skywalker said that he was trying to be but was still learning about the Force and trying to understand it. Mann told him that that never really stops, as the Jedi Order goes back a long way and there was a lot to learn.\nJust then, their surrounding shifted to Ahch-To, the birthplace of the Jedi. Skywalker asked Mann what exactly was going on. Mann explained that Gazian was a gigantic living organism that takes an imprint of the minds that visit it and reproduces them exactly as they were at the moment they were there. Mann added that he had come to the planet to get answers after having a vision, and that's why his imprint was there. Skywalker explained that the Republic had fallen and an Empire had taken over. He said that he had never met a Jedi like Mann, and had only ever met Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, the latter of whom Mann remembered and commented was very old and very wise. Skywalker had also said that he had met a Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, but that he had fallen to the Dark side, something that Mann knew happened occasionally.\nMann then showed Skywalker an imprint of what the High Republic looked like, telling him that it was a Golden Age where they were all connected eight centuries after the defeat of Darth Bane. The mention of Darth Bane made Skywalker confused and comment that it was all too much. Skywalker elaborated that when he started his journey it was exciting and he had been a hero, then he was supposed to save the galaxy by learning from Yoda, but then it all fell apart and now he felt that if he did it wrong he'd become a monster. But Mann said that the Force was so powerful and boundless so it shouldn't be easy to learn how to use it. Mann recalled when he had trained to be a Jedi and how even with help and support how impossible everything felt. But then things he'd thought were impossible became second nature, and he then wanted to keep going deeper and deeper into learning and working at it. But Skywalker was alone, and felt that it was too much. Mann said that the Jedi tend to be what they need to be, whether that be warriors fighting evil, teachers teaching the galaxy, and sometimes they were almost nothing, left with the responsibility of being the only light in the dark of the galaxy. Suddenly they were underwater, floating in an expansive ocean. Mann then told Skywalker that he knew the kind of pressure that the Force choosing you could bring, and decided to tell him a piece of advice that he didn't think many other Jedi would tell him: He didn't have to be a Jedi. Mann told him that there were other ways to use the Force safely and protect life and light, and that there are many paths and choices that could be true to the person he wanted to be. But he also told Skywalker that if he wanted it, the Jedi were there for him. Other past Jedi then appeared in the water and floated around them until they found themselves back in the void-like vision of the Living Sea. He asked Skywalker if he wanted to stay there and speak to him and the many minds in the Living Sea, but Skywalker told him that he thought he should leave. Mann was disappointed, but reminded Skywalker that a part of him would remain there to talk to them as Skywalker saw an imprint of himself appear in front of him.\nSkywalker came to, ignited his lightsaber and put his breath mask back on. He then saw many bodies of Jedi that had stayed in the Living Sea. He found one Jedi skeleton holding a sacred Jedi text, which he brought to the surface and recognized was an invitation.\nZahra later referenced her meeting with Skywalker to Bey, as she believed Bey to the most arrogant rebel she had ever met next to Skywalker.\nAfter the command of Red Squadron was transferred to Antilles following his promotion to squadron leader, which pleased Skywalker, he declined to rejoin the squadron and chose to be stationed onboard the Redemption. When he went to Zastiga, he and R2-D2 were the ones to greet Organa on her arrival to the planet after she and C-3PO left the Mellcrawler, piloted by its owner Nien Nunb and Lieutenant Caluan Ematt. When the time came for Organa to attend the top clearance meeting with the Rebel leadership, Skywalker and Nunb met with Antilles for a discussion of \"reconnaissance tactics\" about Antilles' refusal to pay the Sullustan a drink. He would later return to escort Organa to her quarters before going to his, and two days later, he saw her off, before catching his own shuttle back to the Redemption.\nSoon afterwards, he would go to Kothlis, where he would learn of Solo's location—still frozen in carbonite and kept in Jabba the Hutt's palace—, and where he would keep himself up-to-date with the status of the Alliance Fleet's assembly. He had already devised a plan to rescue Solo when Organa contacted him following the successful Operation Yellow Moon, and showed eagerness to join him on his attempts to rescue the Corellian smuggler.\nSometime before the rescue of Solo, Skywalker took part in a raid on Imperial Refining Platform M36. During the raid, Skywalker used his new lightsaber, along with his Force abilities, to clear a path for Rebel forces to acquire copious Imperial fuel stores. His Rebel companions became awed at his use, although one of them, the major in charge of the operation, held reservations about its power as he had only previously seen such power being wielded by the Sith. Unknown to Skywalker, the Emperor had begun to probe his mental defenses from afar, which caused Skywalker to briefly open his saber in alarm.\nAs Skywalker and the strike team flew away from the platform, they were ambushed by an Imperial Star Destroyer, which launched several TIE Fighters in pursuit. As the battle began to rage, Skywalker's mind was penetrated by a vision from the Emperor. The vision saw Luke follow a possible series of events wherein he would begrudgingly leave the Rebel strike team to its fate and crash-land on an unknown planet, losing his X-wing in the process. As he journeyed from the wreckage together with R2-D2, Luke would leave his lightsaber and helmet on the ground, symbolizing his complete retreat from the concerns of the war.\nHaving later broken free of the Emperor's vision, Skywalker proceeded to aid the Rebels in escaping the Imperial ambush, using his lightsaber to prevent the major's shuttle from leaving, giving him time to pilot the shuttle and draw the Imperials away from the rest of the Rebels.\nIn 4 ABY, Skywalker set in motion the plan to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt due to their failure to do so during the Attack on the Executor. Once again, Skywalker returned to Tatooine, and to Kenobi's hut, wherein he found the missing parts he needed for the construction of his own lightsaber, the pieces left to him by Kenobi. While his friends bustled about preparing for the rescue, Skywalker retreated into the solitude of a desert cave they had chosen as their rendezvous point. Using the Force to assemble the weapon, he brought the kyber crystal inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost an extension of himself.\nAfterwards, Skywalker waited to see if Organa's impersonation of Boushh and liberation of Solo was successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to Jabba's Palace. Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba's Gamorrean guards and his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, but the Hutt was not so easily swayed and attempted to feed Skywalker to his rancor, which Luke later killed, upsetting Malakili, the Rancor's keeper.\nSkywalker killed the monster, but Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance heroes–including an unfrozen Solo–to death in the Great Pit of Carkoon to be eaten by the sarlacc that resided there. However, right before he was put into the pit, Skywalker escaped when R2-D2 shot his lightsaber to him and freed the other prisoners on the skiff. A skirmish ensued in which Skywalker protected his friends, ending the life of several of Jabba's thugs—including Klaatu and Nysad, who shot his cyborg hand during the skirmish—and helping Organa escape the Khetanna after she had killed the Hutt. After destroying the sail barge, Skywalker and his entire team escaped unscathed through a dangerous sandstorm, after which he boarded his X-Wing with R2-D2 and parted ways with the others.\nSkywalker then returned to Dagobah to complete his training and keep the promise he had made to Yoda, but the aged Jedi Master, who had used the Force to prolong his life beyond what was natural, had fallen ill and was finally starting to succumb to age. Yoda told Skywalker that he'd already completed all the training he required, but in order to finally become a true Jedi, he needed to confront Darth Vader one more time. Having grown less and less sure since the revelation, Skywalker feared that it was the truth,\nSkywalker inquired if Vader was truly his father. Skywalker received such confirmation from Yoda, which angered him that they had lied to him for so long, but Yoda confessed that he knew that Skywalker had not been ready to shoulder the burden of being the child of the Dark Lord of the Sith, to which Skywalker expressed his regret that he did not listen to him the first time. After warning him not to underestimate the Emperor's powers or allow the dark side to take hold of him, and that as \"the last of the Jedi\" he had to pass on what he had learned, Yoda made one final revelation to Skywalker before he became one with the Force—that there was \"another Skywalker.\"\nSensing his turmoil, the spirit of Kenobi appeared before Skywalker, who confronted him for lying about his father. Claiming that the good man that Anakin Skywalker had been had died upon his fall to the dark side, Kenobi stated that he did not directly lie to him about his father; he was simply telling him what happened \"from a certain point of view.\" Skywalker voiced his belief that there was still good within his father, and that he could not bring himself to kill him, but Kenobi insisted that he needed to face him again in order to restore balance to the Force. Skywalker then asked about the \"other Skywalker,\" who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi. Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother's identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew Skywalker carried too many burdens already.\nSkywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested moon of Endor to destroy the shield generator that protected the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit, volunteering immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above Sullust. As they approached the moon on the stolen Lambda-class Imperial shuttle Tydirium, Skywalker sensed Vader's presence on the nearby Super Star Destroyer Executor and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of Imperial scout troopers that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on speeder bikes. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.\nUpon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the droids went looking for her, only to be captured by a tribe of Ewoks. Using the Force to prove C-3PO's deific \"magic\", Skywalker convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after C-3PO's tale of their adventures, the whole group was accepted as a part of the village. However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the Force and landed on the moon, and knew that he had to confront Vader. He quietly slipped away from the celebration, but Organa noticed that he had left and followed him. He informed her of what he was planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.\nOrgana was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to him that, somehow, she'd always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.\nEventually encountering an Imperial patrol and willingly surrendering himself to Commander Igar, Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring to him as \"Anakin Skywalker,\" but Vader harshly denounced his former name. Although he managed to make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him, Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner of the Emperor as he was escorted to his throne room onboard the Death Star.\nAs he was brought before the Emperor, the Dark Lord of the Sith repeatedly told the young Jedi that he would fall to the dark side just as easily as Vader had, and let him know that he had purposely allowed the Alliance to discover the second Death Star's location in order to lure them into a trap and finish them off once and for all.\nIn order to temper Skywalker's negative emotions, Sidious forced him to watch as the Imperial Fleet engaged the Rebels. He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous encounter on Bespin , this time the pair would fight as equals.\nAfter successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.\nIn order to goad his son back into fighting him, Vader used telepathy to probe his thoughts, learning of the existence of his daughter and Skywalker's twin sister, stating that perhaps she could be seduced to the dark side if Skywalker could not. This statement pushed Skywalker over the edge and caused him to finally give into his rage. Attacking his father much more aggressively this time, he unleashed his full might upon the Sith Lord. Eventually pushing Vader into a corner, right next to the Death Star's reactor shaft, Skywalker repeatedly struck him with multiple heavy blows, and with one final, devastating strike of his lightsaber, sliced Vader's hand off at the wrist, sending it—and the weapon it still gripped—cascading down into the depths below.\nA cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he'd cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a Jedi like his father before him.\nInfuriated that his plan to corrupt Luke had gone up in smoke, Sidious declared that, if Skywalker would not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of Force lightning against him. Unprepared for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail. During the Sith master assault on the Jedi Knight, Vader had gotten back to his feet and returned to his master's side, and Luke begged his father to save him.\nEventually, seeing his son in such terrible pain became too great for Vader to bear any longer, and in that moment, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was gone, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was reborn. In a snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the shaft to his death. In doing so, however, he turned Sidious's lethal Force lightning on himself, irreparably damaging his life-supporting armor.\nLuke carried Anakin to Imperial shuttle ST 321, where his father asked him to remove his breathing mask. Though Luke was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Anakin told him that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his own eyes. Luke relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father's real face for the first and only time. Anakin then encouraged Luke to leave him and save himself. Though Luke was insistent on saving Anakin, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with his last words, told him to tell Leia that he'd been right about him before passing away. At the cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Anakin Skywalker had finally fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One and had brought balance to the Force. Similarly, by helping his father to return to the light side of the Force by offering him unconditional love and refusing to fight, destroy, or let his anger eclipse the goodness in his heart, Luke Skywalker had achieved what Anakin and the whole Jedi Order failed to achieve upon being twisted by the Clone Wars: to forgive a monster and reveal a man.\nSkywalker took his father's body on board the shuttle and escaped just before the Death Star's destruction, when he was almost intercepted by Green Squadron's Shara Bey, who proceeded to cover him from TIE interceptors after he identified himself. Back on Endor, Skywalker cremated his father's armor  in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, and then joined his friends and sister in the celebration. It was during this moment of celebration that Skywalker saw the onlooking Force spirits of Kenobi, Yoda, and his father, looking at him in approval and with a sense of peace.\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, In the battle's aftermath, Skywalker reported to the Rebel Alliance that the Emperor and Darth Vader were dead. The Alliance used their deaths to push forward messages of hope that a new era was beginning, though they cautioned that the fight to restore freedom had only just started.\nSkywalker and Organa helped the Ewoks Kneesaa and Wicket W. Warrick reset their traps to stop a Gorax. Sensing that Ewoks and Organa needed time to complete the task, Skywalker used his lightsaber to slice through a log that the Gorax had thrown at him before he threw his lightsaber to Organa to use to cut a log.\nSkywalker later officiated the wedding between his sister and Solo.\nIn the days ahead, the Rebel Alliance began the formation of the New Republic, a successor state to the Galactic Republic. The Empire, meanwhile, reeled from its defeat and its leadership was in chaos, and the Imperial government claimed that the reports of the Emperor's demise were treasonous propaganda.\nNot long after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker felt a calling from Pillio in the Jinata system. Chasing the call, Luke along with R2 took his X-wing and set course for the remote aquatic planet. When they arrived, the two came across an Imperial Shuttle making its descent, confirming Skywalker's suspicions that the planet held something of importance. He left his faithful Astromech Droid with his ship, and it was not long before the young Jedi encountered Stormtroopers on guard, who attacked him on sight. Skywalker made his way through several dozens of troopers and officers, remarking that the Empire must have been searching the planet. Sensing something unnatural from within a nearby cave, the Jedi found that native wildlife, Scritters, were attacking the invading imperials. Hearing cries for help, Skywalker made his way further into the depths of the planet to find Del Meeko, a member of Imperial Special Forces Unit Inferno Squad, with his arm stuck in the amber of the Scritters. Despite their different allegiances, Skywalker used his lightsaber to cut through the amber and free the soldier. When Meeko asked why the Jedi helped him, Skywalker simply responded, 'Because you asked'.\nAt that moment, several Scritters burst out of the walls surrounding the two men. Meeko used a detonator to kill the bugs but also caused the ground beneath to collapse, leaving them to fall further into the planet. They landed in a small shallow stream of water, and Skywalker used the Force to protect Meeko from falling rocks. After being helped to his feet, Meeko remarked that stories of the Jedi always scared him as a young boy. Skywalker responded that if they want to get out, they'll need to work together. Making their way through the caves, Luke shared that the Force has brought them to together and apologizes for killing the rest of his men; he was reluctant to do so, but they left him no choice, while Meeko did. As the two made their way out of the cave, Del revealed that the Emperor had an observatory on the planet and that Meeko was tasked with destroying it. Skywalker and Meeko eventually escaped the cave and gained access to the observatory by destroying its defense system.\nSkywalker discovered that the key to opening the vault door is to use the Force, prompting Meeko to wonder why the observatory could only be opened by the Force and if the man who hunted down the Jedi was secretly one of them. Luke suggested that Del had learned to fear the wrong thing.\nThe two investigated the vault, apparently full of junk, and Skywalker took a compass. When Meeko asked why he should be allowed to keep it, Skywalker responded, 'Because I asked'. As the two left, Skywalker remarked that the Empire had done enough damage to innocent worlds and that Meeko could choose not between the Empire or the Rebellion, but to be a better person. He wished the Force with Meeko before leaving.\nAt some point Skywalker was promoted to General.\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Skywalker took on his first student and trained his twin sister in the ways of the Force. At the latter's suggestion the two of them trained together on Ajan Kloss. Under his tutelage, Organa constructed her lightsaber, and began to learn the principles of lightsaber combat. Skywalker also instructed in her in the basics of the Force, teaching her about light side, and in meditation. He was impressed by Organa's strength in the force and how quickly she progressed in her training. While training her, he found it interesting that she struggled with skills and concepts that he had a natural affinity for , but excelled in other areas  that were harder for him to master. He would use various tools to help Organa develop her senses, such as a repurposed A-wing helmet, and marksman-H combat training remotes.\nAt some point during their training together, Skywalker and Organa spent an hour sparring with their lightsabers. Later that same day, Skywalker attempted to teach her in a scenario similar to what he did with Yoda on Dagobah, where she held herself up in a handstand with the Force. At another point, Skywalker explained from personal experience that the Force allowed glimpses of the future, past, and at times, departed, and that these voices would offer her guidance from beyond death in times of hardship.\nOn the final night of her training, Organa experienced a dark vision that her Jedi path would lead to the death of her unborn son. Realizing where the galaxy needed her most, she set aside her lightsaber to focus on her new family and senatorial duties.\nWhile Skywalker hoped that his sister would resume her training later on, Organa gave him her lightsaber to convince him otherwise, asking to pass it on to a promising student someday. However, Skywalker did not do that and never told her where he stored her lightsaber.\nIn 5 ABY, three months after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker planned a mission to an Imperial research base on the planet Vetine in order to retrieve the last remaining fragment of a Force-sensitive tree. The tree, which once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, was stolen by the Emperor after he came to power and converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. Skywalker recruited Shara Bey to fly as his co-pilot on the mission, and, along with Artoo, they flew a stolen Imperial shuttle, Antarra, to Vetine. While en route, Skywalker told Bey about the plan, including how she would pose as ISB Agent Alecia Beck, using codes obtained by Solo and the Pathfinders during a raid on an ISB base at the Wretch of Tayron. Upon their arrival, Bey claimed she was Agent Beck and that she had arrived to perform an unannounced inspection. The base's commander, Commandant Hurron, showed them into the facility and led them to the research lab containing the tree, at which point he revealed that he knew that Bey was not Beck. Hurron questioned why two Rebels would break into the facility, and Skywalker explained the importance of the tree—which he found had two remaining fragments. Skywalker and Bey fought their way out of the base, making their way through numerous stormtroopers who attempted to stop their escape. Once back at Antarra, Hurron ordered his forces to throw thermal detonators at the escaping Rebels, but Skywalker used the Force to deflect them back, killing Hurron and several of his stormtroopers in an explosion.\nThe Rebel trio made their way back towards the Alliance Fleet. During the trip back, Skywalker and Bey discussed the latter's future plans for service in the Rebellion, as Skywalker knew that Bey was considering leaving the Alliance to reunite with her husband, Pathfinder Sergeant Kes Dameron, and their son Poe Dameron|Poe. Bey was unsure as to whether she wanted to leave the Rebels behind, but Skywalker's guidance helped Bey decide to leave the Alliance. The Jedi Knight gifted one of the tree fragments to her, as he had only expected to find one, believing that the important relic would be kept safe with Bey and her family. She and Dameron planted it outside of their new home on Yavin 4.\nAn Imperial officer stationed on a Star Destroyer claimed to have seen the Jedi Knight using the Force and a lightsaber to dispatch Star Destroyers in space, causing them to crash into the surface of the planet. When the Star Destroyer crashed into the surface the officer said he was recovered by a figure who dragged him across the desert searching wreckage for other survivors. He also noted the man wore clothes similar to Luke Skywalker and talked about being raised in another desert.\nThe Galactic Civil War came to a close with the signing of the Galactic Concordance, a peace treaty between the Republic and the Empire that forced it to remain within pre-established borders, though some of the remnants of the once-powerful military force disappeared into the Unknown Regions. Following the signing of the treaty, Leia gave birth to her and Han's son and Luke's nephew, Ben Solo. There were rumors that Skywalker visited his sister and Han before disappearing on an untold mission. Others claimed that his absence was conspicuous.\nWith the Empire fallen and the Sith seamlessly vanquished, Skywalker had great hope for the future of the Jedi. He believed if a single Jedi could bring balance to the Force as his father had done, then a revived Jedi Order could keep the peace and prevent the dark side from ever returning to such strength.\nJust as he promised Farnay near the start of his own Jedi studies, in 5 ABY, Skywalker set about rebuilding the Jedi Order. Despite his optimism, he had many unanswered questions and was hesitant to take on another apprentice after his sister Leia, unsure of his grounding in Jedi lore. Instead, Skywalker largely disappeared from galactic view and dedicated himself to traveling the galaxy in hopes of finding what remained of the Jedi after the Empire's long efforts to eradicate their history. Through his quest, he came to understand much about himself and his destiny and gained the confidence he needed to rebuild the Jedi Order. Luke, being the last Jedi, became a caretaker of the Jedi Order's legacy. As he traveled the galaxy, he also searched for force-sensitives who could possibly become his students.\nSkywalker's research into the Jedi was a long and difficult task that took him years. He was aided by Lor San Tekka, an explorer and member of the Church of the Force who, though not Force-sensitive himself, believed in the Jedi ideals. San Tekka was old enough to remember the Jedi Knights before the Clone Wars, and he did not believe the Emperor's lies about how the Jedi betrayed the Old Republic. San Tekka, who believed that the return of the Jedi Order was essential to bring balance to the Force, became a valuable ally for both Skywalker and Organa.\nGatalenta was one of the first destinations in Skywalker's search, and he also traveled to Moraband, the ancient home of the Sith, to investigate anything he could about the Force. He visited the Deep Core planet of Tython many times and studied its ancient ruined temple, impressed by the majesty of the site every time he visted. He scoured many worlds and assembled a collection of eight ancient bound books and scrolls that described Jedi tenets, history and guidance for those following the path of the Jedi—sacred Jedi texts. One of the books was the Rammahgon, an influential work that was thought destroyed over 5,000 years ago but retrieved by Skywalker while he explored the subterranean ruins of Ossus. The Aionomica was another, a two-volume collection of Jedi explorations and codifications of the Force, part codex, correspondence and scrapbook. He also found a book that was a catalog of the Eeshaypher Collection, a forbidden gallery of artifacts realted to the dark side of the Force.\nSkywalker dedicated much of these years to finding the site of the first Jedi Temple. He uncovered many tantalizing clues that hinted at the origins of the Jedi, but the precise location was a mystery. One key to unravelling the mystery was his study of the spread of the Force-sensitive uneti saplings. He also made use of the Jedi star compass he had discovered in the Emperor's storehouse on Pillio. With a plasma-encased supraluminite lodestone at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient wayfinders and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace. Through studying the compass, Skywalker uncovered a path to Ahch-To the site of Temple Island and the first Jedi Temple. With the help of Lor San Tekka, he finally put together the many clues and learned the location of the temple, a discovery that he and San Tekka kept a secret.\nWith San Tekka, Skywalker hunted down relics the force across the stars. Following the Jedi compass he recovered on Pillio, the pair mapped out the network of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, many of which were forgotten after the end of the Jedi Purge. Their voyages proved fruitful most of the time, Skywalker amassing a massive collection of tomes, texts, scrolls, data cards, ritual items, sigils, and other antique symbols. Besides the Jedi star compass, Skywalker also acquired lightsabers. All of this, the pair of men researched, gaining even deeper understanding of the old Jedi Order and its teachings.\nIn his explorations for Jedi lore, Skywalker discovered the cache of Jedi Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu, and recovered her holocrons which contained a wealth of Jedi knowledge and history. He uncovered many lost Jedi and Force relics throughout the galaxy, including a Jedi Crusader pendant, and another Holocron, of the High Republic Era Jedi Avar Kriss.\nHe came to learn about some of the Jedi Masters that existed before the fall of the Order, such as Mace Windu, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Jocasta Nu. Skywalker also learned about the Midi-chlorians, the Jedi Code, and about the different Jedi Temples that existed such as the Lothal Jedi Temple. Luke as well as learning about the light, he also learned about the Dark Side. Luke learned about several Sith Lords and dark side warriors such as Darth Bane, Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and the Inquisitorius Jedi hunters of the Galactic Empire and about several locations and temples strong with the Dark Side such as his father's castle Fortress Vader on Mustafar. With all this, he also learned about the Sith's history and several events, such as the creation of Darth Bane's Rule of Two, and the Scourge of Malachor.\nAnother relic he recovered was a page of the Journal of Caleb Dume, a survivor of the Jedi Purge who took on the new name Kanan Jarrus, fought against the Empire, and trained his own apprentice, Ezra Bridger, in the years of Skywalker's own youth on Tatooine. He eventually brought this and the other Jedi artifacts he had uncovered to Ahch-To and compiled his knowledge of the Jedi into a book he called The Secrets of the Jedi. Ahch-To was also where Skywalker collected the Rammahgon, the Aionomica, the Chronicles of Brus-bu, Poetics of a Jedi, and the other sacred Jedi texts and assembled them into a small library housed in an uneti tree.\nIn approximately 9 ABY, a Force-sensitive member of Yoda's species named Grogu reached out in the Force from the seeing stone on Tython. Grogu had been raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant before the Great Jedi Purge but had not yet been fully trained as a Jedi, and had since become a foundling cared for by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, whom had been tasked with taking Grogu to someone who could train him in the use of the Force.\nShortly afterwards, Grogu was taken by an Imperial remnant. Skywalker tracked Grogu to a light cruiser that Djarin and his allies had boarded in their own efforts to rescue him. Skywalker boarded the vessel with R2-D2 and defeated a platoon of third-generation dark troopers that had trapped Grogu and Djarin's team on the ship's bridge. Afterwards, Skywalker offered his hand to Grogu, and, noting the child's strong attachment to Djarin, told Djarin that he would take care of him if Djarin allowed it. Djarin relinquished Grogu to Skywalker to be trained in the ways of the Force and Skywalker left the ship with the child.\nFulfilling the dying wish of Jedi Master Yoda, Skywalker set out to begin training a new generation of Jedi. Having rescued and brought in an original Jedi Padawan from the twilight years of the Galactic Republic, Skywalker ventured to Ossus with the young Grogu to build the first Jedi Academy after the Jedi Order's near extinction following Order 66. Possessing the wisdom and teachings of his own masters, Skywalker tried to educate his young student through the ways of the Force. Telling tales of Master Yoda onto Grogu, the young Jedi Master passed on what he had learned, echoing Yoda's words \"size matters not\" and to do, not try. However, Skywalker strived to make impression on his small student, having to stop him from using the Force to eat creatures and let Grogu use the Force as he did. Knowing that knowledge lied in Grogu's memory, Luke offered to help him remember and placed his hands gently on the alien's head. Seeing the traumatic images of the 501st Legion gunning down three Jedi Knights protecting the Padawan, everything faded to black when the clones killed the Jedi and moved towards Grogu. When his student awoke, Luke greeted his return and began to better understand the turmoil and subsequent reluctance of Grogu towards his lessons.\nWhile carrying Grogu at his back as he had done with Yoda on Dagobah, Skywalker felt the presence of the Mandalorian. After a time, Grogu seemed to master balance and studied in awe as Luke practiced his skills with the lightsaber. Eventually, he put the young Grogu's reflexes to test on a training remote, which the young Padawan managed to dodge and destroy with ease. Ahsoka Tano approached Skywalker and complimented him on his progress with Grogu. The doubtful Jedi expressed his concerns that Grogu's progress was due to him gradually remembering his training on Coruscant, not necessarily his training so far with him. Ahsoka stated that sometimes the student teaches the master. Skywalker noted the Mandalorian's presence and Tano gave him a present meant for Grogu. Not sure whether Grogu had heart for the way of the Jedi, Skywalker shared his thoughts. Fortunately, Tano knew the same mind of Skywalker's father, seeing that same compassionate heart which she felt Anakin had for her and mentioned Luke's alikeness. Skywalker asked what should be done and Tano told him to trust his instincts, wisdom she learned from her master. She then departed the planet and said the two would perhaps meet again and told the Force be with him.\nHeeding the advice of Tano, Skywalker decided to offer Grogu a final choice. In the stone hut, Skywalker presented Grogu with Din Djarin's gift as well as the lightsaber of Master Yoda, which Skywalker had kept. The first path was to accept the present from the Mandalorian and be returned to him, however, by choosing attachment he would forsake the Jedi way. The second was to pick up Yoda's lightsaber and pledge himself to Luke's teachings to become his first Jedi Padawan. He told Grogu that to become a Jedi would take years and hard work, though at the end he could be a great Jedi. He then let Grogu choose.\nGrogu would choose the armor, thus leading Skywalker to put him in his X-wing starfighter and instruct R2-D2 to pilot him to Tatooine to be reunited with Djarin.\nThough reluctant to take on another apprentice at first, when the Force awakened in Skywalker's nephew Ben Solo and his mother Leia could see the dark side taking hold of her son, she entrusted the boy to her brother to help him find balance. He agreed to train the 10-year-old Solo, in 15 ABY. Skywalker took on the responsibilities of a Jedi Master by teaching his nephew. After Ben's fall to the dark side however, Luke would say that he was merely playing the role of Jedi Master as it was a title he had not formally earned.\nSkywalker taught Solo the ways of the Jedi, in its many forms, under the tutelage and impressed on his pupil the importance of practicing discipline and control. Solo gave his best efforts to gain his Master's approval, although at times their familial bond caused him to address Skywalker as uncle instead of Master. Though he loved his nephew, Skywalker had committed his life to reestablishing the Jedi Order's teachings, which had virtually nothing to do with family ties; therefore, he taught Solo that detachment and distance were necessary to gaining the pure focus that every Jedi aspired to achieve.\nHis nephew soon joined in exploring the galaxy for ancient Jedi lore, and together they found holocrons from forgotten eras and ancient Jedi texts with arcane writings. The two shared more than the same Skywalker blood, for like him, Ben gained a strong devotion to the ways of the Jedi Order. Skywalker saw his nephew's raw power and believed he could pass on his strengths to him, and he attempted to manage his progress through the Force by having him exercise a level of restraint. Solo was his strongest and most prized student, and Skywalker went on to place his hope for the Jedi Order's future within his nephew, and despite knowing of the darkness within his pupil, the Jedi Master believed he was strong enough to keep it in check.\nSkywalker was a kind master, and Solo considered his uncle to be a strong and amazing teacher, but Skywalker made mistakes that culminated over time, protecting Ben from the dark truths of their family, much like his sister did before him, and inadvertently isolated Ben over the years of his training. At the request of his sister, Luke never provided his nephew with the details of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side or Darth Vader's redemption and return to the light.\nDuring his training of his nephew, a powerful dark side-practitioner known as Snoke, who was the Supreme Leader of a splinter group of the Empire known as the First Order, and also secretly a puppet of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, began influencing Ben from afar, clouding him with the dark side. At some point Skywalker had encountered Snoke and supposedly damaged him, and Snoke was responsible for indirectly inspiring Luke to rebuild the Jedi Order, having tried to shatter his resolve.\nIn 19 ABY, the year his nephew turned fourteen, Skywalker, Ben, and Lor San Tekka traveled to a Jedi outpost on Elphrona, a location from the days of the High Republic Era, hoping to find Jedi artifacts. Luke flew the ship and conversed with San Tekka, while Solo, without his master's knowledge, was communing with Snoke. When the landed, Skywalker cautioned his apprentice to careful, as a place such as the outpost was likely to be rigged with traps. Inside, they found a treasure trove that Skywalker judged so impressive he thought it may be better than Jocasta Nu's cache, including many Jedi holocrons and a lightsaber rifle. As the three perused the outpost, instantly, both Skywalker and Solo felt a cold presence within the structure. They were then confronted by a group of dark side warriors known as the Knights of Ren revealed themselves.\nTheir master, \"Ren\", declared themselves, and claimed ownership of all within the outpost and that they way they took was up to Skywalker. He countered, shooting back that all within the outpost, due it being a Jedi location, belonged to the Order; all the holocrons and relics belonged to Luke, for he was the last Jedi Knight. He ignited his saber and instructed Solo to hang back and protect San Tekka, and he would handle the threat. Skywalker engaged the knights, not intending to kill any of them, and managed to overpower them quite easily. He then proceeded to prepare himself for a duel with the knight leading them only known simply as \"Ren\" who wielded a red lightsaber, however realizing that Skywalker's power was superior Ren withdrew his knights and left the planet. However not before removing his helmet and warning Skywalker about the strong shadow within Solo, and then offering his apprentice the chance, if he chose, to seek them out if decided he wanted another path.\nUltimately, the structure proved to be a source of more knowledge for Skywalker, for he recovered the holocrons and other relics inside, leaving the outpost empty, but his nephew was prompted with the dark side of the Force.\nSkywalker trained Solo for years before he felt capable of taking on other apprentices, but over the course of the pair's journeys he gathered disciples, young force-sensitive beings adrift with no way to harness their abilities as a result the Jedi Purge, who went on to be his first students. Skywalker's new students numbered about a dozen besides his nephew, including students Voe, Tai, and Hennix, and he worked to teach them everything he had learned in his own training and about the light side of the Force per Yoda's command.\nSkywalker hoped that teaching the students in a real Jedi Temple would offer them a more traditional Jedi path than his own training under Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. He kept temple's location on Ossus a secret known only to the members of the Order and his loyal droid R2-D2. Skywalker stored the recovered Jedi knowledge and relics that he and Lor San Tekka had recovered within the Jedi Temple, a decision which Solo disagreed, which he believed was just locked up and never used.\nWith the small gathering of his new students looking to him as a spiritual guide and mentor for the Jedi arts, Skywalker believed he could usher in a new era of enlightenment. With his attention now split between several other apprentices, Skywalker's nephew Ben Solo's focus was drawn away to dark Force knowledge. Teaching several Jedi techniques and traditions as telekinesis, meditation, and the use and construction of lightsabers, Skywalker's approach for guiding the young minds under his care was steeped in his own master Yoda's teachings passed on while he was on Dagobah, so would often be preaching about patience and balance.\nWhile also instilling the belief that all beings were equal within the Force, he gave lectures outside his temple, passing on ever more experience from training with Yoda on Dagobah as he taught the levitation of rocks through the Force. During one such event, student Voe asked why Ben Solo was stronger, where Skywalker compared the Force to a door, that it would become easier to use the more she opened herself up to it. The Jedi Master also tutored Hennix in opening holocrons through the Force, reminding the young Quarren to listen to the unique voices of each holocron, for each one was different based on their teachings.\nSkywalker desired heavily to preserve the teachings of the Jedi Order, laboring to pass on the best of what Yoda and Obi-Wan taught him as Jedi mentors at his Jedi temple and to instill the core beliefs they embodied within the next generation. Additionally, Luke understood what Yoda experienced with himself on Dagobah as teacher, having the same unique frustrations with his own pupils; a master guiding a young unseasoned student that was convinced they were wasting time on pointless exercises, such as stacking stones. As his first disciples grew older and new younglings came into the New Jedi Order's care, Skywalker had Twi'lek named Enyo help him as one of the younglings' instructors.\nIn 21 ABY, Skywalker started feeling an increasing darkness in the Force and having dark visions that frequently came to him in meditation. One day, Lor San Tekka, who was the only person Skywalker told about the visions, visited Skywalker in his temple on Ossus, his old friend's arrival heralded to Skywalker by Ben Solo. San Tekka greeted Skywalker and Solo, but once the latter was gone, asked Skywalker about the visions and whether or not they had become stronger or changed. Skywalker asked San Tekka to help him understand the visions and learn what the place in them was by standing vigil over him while he accessed the vision and described it. San Tekka was hesitant, but agreed, and Skywalker thus began the meditation.\nMuch quicker than his other meditations, Skywalker found himself in an empty dark void but felt an all-consuming presence within it which he had only thought he had sensed before. Then the vison shifted and he found himself standing on the ancient hidden Sith world of Exegol, though he did not know that was what he was seeing. Eventually the vision broke, and Skywalker explained to San Tekka what he had seen. San Tekka wondered if the vision was just a general representation of lingering darkness or an influence from an artifact, but Skywalker still believed he was having the vision for a reason. Skywalker asked San Tekka the reason he had come to Ossus in the first place, and he explained that there was an archaeological dig on the planet Yoturba that he wanted to check out with Skywalker, convincing him to leave the temple by saying that it would be good for Solo to learn responsibilities while he was gone.\nSkywalker and San Tekka arrived at the archeological expedition on Yorturba that was being conducted by the Lerct Historical Institute and were greeted by archaeologist Dr. Beaumont Kin, who informed them that the dig site was disappointing and they had not found a Jedi temple. Skywalker still carried a feeling that he was there for a reason despite this, and he would be proven correct when an archaeologist named Tee Mairi discovered a Sith holocron at the site. Skywalker recognized it immediately, and San Tekka recognized the writing on it as the Sith's mirrored Aurebesh. Skywalker still wasn't convinced that it was what he had sensed there, and would be again proved correct when he heard screaming echoing throughout the site. Archeologist Mico Haswell had discovered a Sith kyber crystal and had his mind influenced by it, causing him to uncontrollably lash out and cause destruction with the Force. Luke restrained him with the Force, but in reaching out to him once again had a vision of Exegol that Haswell was now present in. Haswell leapt toward Skywalker in the vison and moved in a way that Skywalker recognized to be inhuman and even reptilian. Then Skywalker was on Yoturba again and managed to restrain the man with the Force again, calling a team of medics to sedate him via an injection.\nHaswell was once again in control of himself, and Skywalker questioned him about what happened, though the man was not able to remember much. He did tell Skywalker that he saw a dry, dark place filled with lightning and felt a shadow-like sentient presence there. Once Haswell passed out, Skywalker discovered the bled kyber crystal in his hand, and confiscated it. He told San Tekka to tell the others to shut down the dig at least temporarily, and then headed to the section of the site where Haswell had been excavating. He discovered that the chamber was actually a crashed ship, and discovered more bled kyber crystals within it, that like the one Haswell had been holding, were the wrong size and shape for a lightsaber. This and his experience on the planet confirmed for Skywalker that something dark and evil was coming, deciding to leave San Tekka there to look over the dig site while he went to Tython in search of answers.\nSkywalker traveled to Tython and visited the ruined Jedi temple known as the Force-henge, where he sat on the seeing stone and began to study the Sith Holocron and the kyber crystals and perform research through his many ancient tomes and personal notes. In a book that was a catalog of the Eeshaypher Collection, Skywalker discovered an entry about a Sith wayfinder, which he found remarkably similar in appearance and utility to the Sith holocron. The book stated that the wayfinders contained navigational data to an ancient Sith world called Ixigul—or in Skywalker's translation: Exegol. Skywalker gleaned from both the catalog and his other research that Exegol was meant to be a place of power and eternal life, and that its secret was so important that only two Sith wayfinders were ever made. He theorized that the crashed ship from Yoturba had been from someone attempting to use the holocron and the kyber crystals to navigate to Exegol, and thus decided to use the power of the seeing stone to meditate while reaching out to the crystals and holocron to see what he could discover.\nDuring his meditation, Skywalker once again had a vision of Exegol, but this time if felt like he was truly on the planet, causing him to wonder if the information stored in the holocron had allowed the seeing stone to actually transport him to the planet. Skywalker was then approached by nine Sith wraiths on the planet who ignited red lightsabers and began to attack him. Skywalker could block their lightsabers with his own, but could not attack the wraiths themselves, his blade and his body merely passing right through them. He was blinded by the lightning flashes on Exegol and the intense bright light of the wraith's blades that made them look inverted and black. Skywalker started struggling to fight them more and more until all nine wraiths eventually went in for one coordinated strike, but before they could a blue glow in the shape of a person holding a lightsaber appeared in from of Skywalker and pushed them away. Skywalker realized he was being assisted by a Force-spirit with a blue-bladed lightsaber and initially thought was Kenobi, but when the figure lowered his hood, Skywalker learned that it was his father, Anakin Skywalker. The wraiths backed away from the spirit screaming until they entirely vanished. Anakin Skywalker then reached out his hand to Luke, who took it and then found himself back on Tython as if he had never left.\nLuke found that many of his books were burning and the holocron was completely destroyed, putting them out before speaking to Anakin. Anakin's figure flashed in and out and shifted between him as a young Jedi and him as the old man Luke had seen behind the mask of Darth Vader. Luke noticed that he seemed to be in pain and afraid. Anakin explained that there was a disturbance in the Force that was a shadow from an ancient time. He also clarified that the seeing stone had sent a part of Luke to Exegol and that it had taken everything in him to bring him back. Anakin reminded Luke that he could divert the path of the Force if he needed to, and that no matter how dark things seemed he was never alone as long as he allowed the Force to be his guide. Anakin then disappeared and left Luke alone until he heard the sound of a ship flying overhead and landing. It was Lando Calrissian, in the Lady Luck, who greeted Luke, but look immediately told him that he needed to leave and that it was too dangerous for him to be there. But Calrissian told him that Lor San Tekka had told him where he was because Calrissian had information about the Sith, and also believed they were back.\nCalrissian brought Skywalker onto his ship and explained that overheard an assassin named Ochi of Bestoon who had become inebriated at a remote bar bragging that he had been sent by a Sith remnant to kidnap a girl from her parents. Lando elaborated that he had checked out a New Republic report about the family being attacked in Wild space that backed up Ochi's story, explaining that the New Republic had apparently relocated the family after the incident. He then displayed a hologram of a hex charm that the family had been carrying as proof that they were being hunted by the Sith. Skywalker recognized it immediately as a symbol of the Sith and decoded mirrored Aurebesh on it to be a Sith saying. Calrissian expressed his worry over Ochi's implication that the Sith were still out there pulling strings, and wondered why they would want that family and go through the trouble of kidnapping the girl. Skywalker told Calrissian about his visions of Exegol, and told him that the way to the planet was hidden in a Sith wayfinder. Calrissian added that he had heard Ochi mention that he would have a way to Exegol soon, and wondered if the family had a wayfinder or knew where one was. But unbeknownst to Skywalker and Calrissian, the father of the family was a strand-cast of the late Emperor Palpatine named Dathan, and the girl, his daughter named Rey, was thus Palpatine's genetic granddaughter.\nCalrissian decided that he and Skywalker needed to go together to find the family and stop the hunter from getting to them, urging Skywalker to get ahead of the shadow that he had sensed before it was too late. Skywalker was hesitant to bring Calrissian along, but agreed to partially because he was aware of Calrissian's daughter's kidnapping and his friend's desperate hope that investigating this kidnapping could lead to her. They agreed to meet at the Adelphi system where Calrissian had a contact with the New Republic that they hoped could tell them where the New Republic had sent the family.\nSkywalker and Calrissian met with the latter's contact, Shriv Suurgav, in the New Republic staging outpost over the planet Adelphi. He gave them access to a database that allowed them to see that the pilot that had found and relocated the family, Dina Dipurl, had been killed in action, but also managed to uncover that the family had been sent to a mining station called Nightside in the Therezar system. Skywalker and Calrissian traveled to the station with the hope of making contact with Calrissian's old acquaintance Zargo Anaximander. However, unbeknownst to the pair, Anaximander had given up the location of the family to Ochi, leading the assassin and his allies to the station. When Skywalker and Calrissian arrived, they found the station under attack by the Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon, who, even though they were working for Ochi, ignored Ochi's orders for a clean extraction of the family and instead performed a raid on Nightside. During the attack, Skywalker and Calrissian split up, and now alone, Skywalker came upon a masked Pantoran woman who appeared to be a Sith and was wielding the ancient lost lightsaber of Darth Noctyss. The two came into conflict briefly until the section of the station they were in started to become destroyed in the attack and the woman escaped in a customized imperial TIE Defender. Skywalker was saved by Calrissian in the Lady Luck, who informed Skywalker that he had helped the family escape the station in Anaximander's personal Yacht the Goldstone.\nSkywalker and Calrissian continued to follow the family across the galaxy, first to Torrenoteer Minor, before using his friend Lina Graf's ship the Star Herald to travel to the planet Polaar to get information from Komat, a woman who was formerly part of the cult known as the Acolytes of the Beyond who collected Sith artifacts like the lightsaber of Darth Noctyss. Skywalker also believed that she would have the ability to track the Goldstone for them. Skywalker had previously encountered her and the Acolytes of the Beyond and had helped her leave the cult. Komat revealed that the woman Skywalker had encountered was the former leader of the Acolytes of the Beyond, a woman named Kiza, and that the mask she wore was the Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard which contained the spirit of the ancient Sith lord Exim Panshard and allowed him to take over her when she wore it. Komat was able to locate the Goldstone, but shortly after she did droids sent by Kiza attacked the planet. Skywalker and the others managed to defeat them, and discovered that they contained bled kyber crystals that were also pieces of the large broken one Skywalker had found on Yoturba. Skywalker decided that he would use the droids' navigational data to locate Kiza and make sure that she and subsequently Exim Panshard did not make it to Exegol, and thus make sure the Sith did not return. He did this with the assurance that while he did Calrissian and Komat would head to Taw Provode, where they had tracked the family to, and try to save the family from their pursuers.\nSkywalker located Kiza on an asteroid on the edge of the Red Honeycomb Zone. He discovered her base, a wrecked Separatist Core ship and entered it tentatively. He discovered the Mask of Exim Panshard sitting on a plinth inside, but when he looked at it was overwhelmed with all consuming vision's of Panshard's life, including his acts of mass murder committed against his people in order to drain his life force in an attempt to live forever. Then Kiza arrived and Skywalker attempted to try and appeal to her and choose a good path, with the woman even clearly expressing regret. But she was coerced by the mask to put it back on and she and Skywalker engaged in lightsaber combat, Kiza fueled by the knowledge of Panshard. Their fight caused much destruction in the ship, including a droid forge that sent molten material everywhere and melted the ship. Skywalker attempted one last time to reach Kiza, but she again said no, essentially saying she was already too committed to the dark. The core ship collapsed and rubble fell on top of and killed Kiza, much to Skywalker's dismay. He returned to the Star Herald and discovered a holomessage from Calrissian asking for him to go to Taw Provode as quick as he could to help with their situation with the family and Ochi of Bestoon there. But unbeknownst to Skywalker, Panshard's mask survived, and as he departed some of Kiza's droids followed programming to reforge the mask with melted bled kyber crystals, before placing the mask on Kiza's dead body, allowing Panshard to live again by possessing and reanimating her body.\nSkywalker arrived on Taw Provode just as Calrissian and Komat had been discovered and captured by Ochi of Bestoon and his subordinate Corsec forces. Skywalker faced off with Ochi, and was surprised that his lightsaber did not cut through Ochi's dagger. The power of Ochi's dagger allowed him to hold himself off against the Jedi for some time until Skywalker managed to use to ignite a fuels reserve and trigger a massive explosion. Panshard appeared in his TIE Defender and started shooting at Skywalker and the others, leadng Skywalker to realize that the mask was not really destroyed and the ancient Sith Lord lived on. Skywalker and Komat decided to chase him into space, while Calrissian and R2-D2 went after the family.\nSkywaker and Komat followed Panshard to Taw Provode's solitary moon, using the Star Herald to shoot his TIE Defender down and strand him on the moon. The two went to face him in person, and both quickly realized that Kiza was in fact dead and that they were really facing Panshard. Panshard told Skywalker to tell him how to get to Exegol or be killed, but Skywalker and Komat refused and instead faced off with their lightsabers. Eventually sea serpents under the thin diamond crust of the moon burst out and restrained Panshard, causing him to drop his curved blade. Skywalker picked it up and then called the mask to him with the Force before slicing it into four pieces with the two lightsabers and destroying Panshard for good.\nSkywalker was informed by Calrissian that he had found the bodies of the parents of the family, but that the girl was still missing. and so Skywalker and him traveled to Neftali where they buried them and honored their lives. Skywalker and Calrissian worried that Ochi had successfully captured the girl and taken her to Exegol, but they could not be sure, and decided to keep looking for Ochi.\nSkywalker and Calrissian eventually tracked Ochi to Pasaana where they found his ship but no Ochi. They did find a sheet of old-looking paper with a wayfinder drawn on it that proved that Ochi had had a clue to a wayfinder, but other than that, the trail went cold. Skywalker then returned to Ossus to continue running his Jedi academy and left Calrissian on Pasanna, who decided to use the planet as his base to look for both the lost girl and his daughter. Skywalker stored the pieces of bled kyber crystal and the shards of Exim Panshard's mask in the temple with other artifacts. Skywalker would chronicle his efforts to trace the disturbance in the Force and find the Sith Wayfinder in the Rammahgon throughout his explorations in the galaxy.\nOne night in 28 ABY, Skywalker, sensing the darkness within his nephew Ben growing in glimpses during his training, decided to probe Solo's mind as he lay asleep. He learned that Snoke had turned his apprentice's heart to the dark side, and experienced a brief dark vision that Solo would bring nothing but death and destruction and leave Skywalker's loved ones in anguish. Despite the love for his nephew, in a flash of defensive instinct, Skywalker thought he could stop that future and for a brief moment raised his lightsaber to destroy him, believing that it was the only way to halt his descent into darkness and prevent the end of everything he loved. This instinct was gone almost the second that it had come, and Skywalker was immediately filled with shame.\nSkywalker had failed to correctly view that his nephew's mind was still conflicted, and his choice not yet made between light and darkness. From Rey's point of view, Skywalker's failure as not only Solo's Jedi Master, but his uncle and family, had been completed when this occurred.\nSolo had already awoken to see his uncle standing over him with his lightsaber raised. Confused and angry, Solo pulled his own lightsaber to him in self-defense and attacked Skywalker, using the Force to pull down the hut on top of him. When Skywalker came around, he emerged from the rubble of the hut to find his temple destroyed, with his other apprentices either killed or vanished with Solo. This effectively left Skywalker the last of the Jedi once more as he was after the death of his own master, Yoda, decades earlier. Solo eventually became the apprentice of Snoke and took the new name \"Kylo Ren,\" becoming the leader of a group of dark side warriors known as the Knights of Ren.\nLeft deeply affected and mentally broken by what he believed to be his ultimate failure, Skywalker lost faith in the Force and the vision of the Jedi for having failed to rebuild the Jedi Order. Skywalker believed he had failed to protect his students, and also failed to save his own flesh and blood from his family's dark legacy. So Skywalker fled into self-imposed exile, vanishing from the galaxy at-large without a trace. No one knew for sure where he went, but those closest to him believed he went off in search of the first Jedi Temple.\nTo those who knew what Skywalker was seeking, there remained a way to find him: after destroying the Jedi, the Empire had begun to seek out the thousands of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, with the aim to prevent anyone from discovering the lost secrets of the Order. As such, Imperial authorities discovered the locations of some of the first Jedi Temples. The partial map remained within the archives of the Empire. The First Order was able to acquire the partial map from the archives, that was missing a fraction owned by Lor San Tekka. As he had downloaded Imperial star maps during his time on the first Death Star, R2-D2, Skywalker's faithful astromech, was able to recover the contents of the map.\nThe Jedi Master fled to the location of the Temple—on an aquatic planet named Ahch-To—that he discovered by studying the spread of uneti saplings. Having failed in bringing back the Jedi Order, Skywalker intended nothing more than to live out the rest of his days there in reclusive exile. Taking the relics he had uncovered with him, the hermit shut himself off from the Force, consequently ceasing the guidance of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker's spirits. He had pledged to protect the hidden world and its many secrets.\nAmong the relics Luke had collected and brought into his exile were the sacred Jedi texts and the Jedi Crusader pendant. Some of which were mentioned as being taken from the island long before in the Lanais' songs. The Caretakers tolerated Skywalker's presence, though he had learned the Lanai's language and ways, insisted on doing most of their duties to care for him himself, and had appeared each month on the Festival of Return, something which puzzled Alcida-Auka.\nThough absent from galactic affairs, Skywalker's story was nonetheless a thing of myth and legend in certain corners of the galaxy. His exploits in the Galactic Civil War were known to the Resistance, a band of freedom fighters led by now-General Organa to combat the rise of the First Order. Resistance fighter pilot Jessika Pava learned that C-3PO, who also served in the Resistance, knew Skywalker and asked the droid to tell her a story about his former master. Threepio regaled her with the tale of Skywalker's encounter with Sarco Plank on Devaron, and how Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and indeed returned to Devaron. Members of the First Order, however, had a less-than-ideal view of the Jedi Master; the First Order taught their followers, including stormtroopers like FN-2187, that Skywalker was an enemy who helped destroy the Empire. Despite the knowledge about Skywalker, the mystical elements of his life, as well as the Jedi in general, were seen as mythic rather than historic.\nPrior to Rey's arrival on Ahch-To, Luke Skywalker had a dream while sleeping in his hut. In his dream, he saw the life he would never have, one in which he never left Tatooine and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle, marrying Camie Marstrap and allowing the Galactic Empire to shatter the Rebel Alliance and destroy more planets with the Death Star. Luke eventually awoke, trying to shake away his dream, and left his hut. He was still astonished at the oceans of Ahch-To, which he attributed to growing up in the deserts of Tatooine. As he reached a meadow overlooking the sea, he was still unable to shake the dream away, believing it wasn't an ordinary dream, but the Force at work. He also reflected that his efforts to block the Force out were impossible as it always demanded to be heard. In that moment, the old Jedi Master felt that someone had found him.\nIn 34 ABY, Organa sent Resistance fighter Poe Dameron, the son of Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, to Jakku to find San Tekka and recover the map to Skywalker's alleged location, as she hoped her brother would return and help in the fight against the dark side. The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the last Jedi. Dameron found San Tekka living in the village of Tuanul, and the old explorer gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid BB-8, before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived and sacked the village. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku scavenger named Rey. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed strength in the Force that she had not yet discovered. Rey teamed with FN-2187, an ex-Stormtrooper who took the name Finn after defecting from the First Order, and, with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, sought to return the map fragment to the Resistance.\nAfter Rey discovered the lightsaber that once belonged to both Anakin and Luke in the pirate castle belonging to Maz Kanata on Takodana, a thousand year-old being who had knowledge of the Force, she began to unlock her own Force abilities. After being captured by Ren on Takodana and briefly interrogated onboard Starkiller Base in an attempt by Ren to analyze Rey's thoughts to find the path to Skywalker, BB-8's map fragment was soon combined with R2-D2's, and together they provided a complete map to Ahch-To. Accompanied by Chewbacca, Rey flew the Millennium Falcon to Ahch-To and found the old Jedi Master on an island.\nWhen Rey arrived on the island, Skywalker was standing up top the saddle, summoning the will to try to torch the tree library again having just failed to do so. While standing there, Skywalker was reflecting that his efforts to block the Force from him was impossible as it always demanded to be heard. But in that moment, the old Jedi Master felt that someone had found him, turning around to see who was, discovering Rey. After making her way to Skywalker, Rey presented him with his father's old weapon as a symbol of the only hope that the galaxy had left.\nAfter taking his old lightsaber and looking it over, Skywalker, emotion roiled over his face, hoping to lose the blade once again, tossed it behind him and left the plateau, with Rey following close behind him. Secluding himself in his hut, Skywalker thought to himself that he didn't expect a child with a worthless antique and the delusions of grandeur to find him. Despite her repeated attempts, Skywalker declined to help her or the Resistance, even though he knew that the girl had been sent by his sister Leia. Later, Luke was folding his old clothes then heard Rey trying to reach out to him again by knocking on his door but he told her to go away. However, Luke was surprised when his door broke open but was even more surprised to see his old friend Chewbacca was with her. Hearing how they got to where he was with the Millennium Falcon, Luke asked where Han was as Rey and Chewbacca told him that his old friend and brother-in-law was dead, stunning Skywalker.\nFeeling regret for not having sensed his brother-in-law's death for having disconnected himself from the Force, Luke was comforted by the Wookiee, who hugged him. When Rey discovered several original texts of Jedi teachings hidden within a sacred tree on the island, Skywalker learned that she had the Force within her and sought assistance to understand it and her place in the galaxy. Skywalker revealed that he had come to the place where the Jedi started in order to die, and voiced his belief that it was time for the Jedi Order to die.\nThe next night, the former Jedi Master slipped into the Millennium Falcon and recalled the adventures he had experienced. While aboard, Skywalker reunited with R2 who, after he insisted that he could not be convinced to help, replayed Leia's holographic message to Kenobi. Although Skywalker grumbled that the tactic \"was a cheap move\" on the droid's part, it nevertheless inspired Skywalker to agree to give Rey some basic initiation training as a Jedi, explaining the basic foundations of the Force.\nDuring the first lesson, Rey sensed the presence of the dark side cavern underneath the island, causing the ground to shake around them as Rey felt the pull of the dark side. It was at this moment that Skywalker realized Rey's level of power was identical to that of his nephew Ben; this caused him to worry whether he should train another with such power and to promptly abandon the lesson. Skywalker realized something else from this lesson; that Rey was the Emperor, Darth Sidious', granddaughter, which is why she was so easily drawn to the dark side. He later found her practicing with a quarterstaff and then with the returned lightsaber. Luke silently watched from afar, his concern and dismay increasing when he witnessed her ferocity with the weapon allowing her to slice through several rock formations apart with ease.\nEventually after the second lesson, Skywalker revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous power in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark side, becoming Kylo Ren. He then destroyed the Jedi temple Skywalker had started, taking some of his other apprentices with him and killing the rest. Skywalker went to the meditation ledge and managed to regain his Force abilities, which were suppressed for years after he shut himself off the Force allowing him to sense his sister from across the galaxy.\nSkywalker went to find Rey in order to tell her that he was going back to the Resistance with her but instead he found Rey talking with Kylo Ren through the Force due to a Force-bond that he previously was unable to detect. Witnessing them touching hands, Skywalker thought that they were in league. He had gestured at the walls and the ceiling of the hut Rey was in, and all the stone blocks were shot outward from the hut's center, scattering them around the bench. Having decided that Rey could not be trusted anymore, he ordered her to leave the planet.\nAn enraged Rey proceeded to battle Skywalker with her staff, only to be swiftly disarmed after stumbling over a stone, leading to Rey threatening him with his father's lightsaber. She revealed that, according to Kylo, Skywalker had tried to murder him while he was asleep and defenseless simply because he was afraid of his strength in the Force, sparking a duel between mentor and student. Skywalker clarified that when he had arrived at the hut, he sensed the power and darkness within his nephew and, for a brief instant, did desire to kill him and activated his lightsaber on instinct. However, the moment passed and left him filled with shame, for the look on his nephew's face was not one of darkness, but of a scared child, only for the boy to collapse the hut around them in self-defense.\nRey told Skywalker that like when he confronted his father about the light side still within him, she sensed the goodness still within Kylo Ren. Skywalker disagreed, saying that it is no longer there. Unable to convince him otherwise, Rey secretly stole the texts to teach herself later and left the planet without him to confront Kylo. While Rey boarded the Millennium Falcon to leave, Skywalker saw R2 for the last time and told him to send his best to Threepio and that he would need to stay with Rey to make sure she got back to safety.\nAs Rey left Ahch-To, Luke realized the similarity between her departure and when Yoda and Kenobi insisted him to remain on Dagobah to complete his training rather than abandon to save his friends at Cloud City.\nThe following night, Skywalker returned to the tree containing the Jedi texts with the intention of burning it to the ground. As he approached the tree, he was greeted by the spirit of Yoda, whom he had not seen in decades since he last saw him on Dagobah and Endor. Skywalker affirmed his desire to burn the tree with the texts inside but then began to hesitate when he attempted to do so. Yoda instead proceeded to summon a bolt of lightning, setting the tree alight and while laughing, repelled Skywalker with the flames when he changed his mind and tried to save the texts. As the tree burned, the two masters sat next to each other and Yoda reminded Skywalker that he needed to heed his final instructions to him before Yoda's physical death on Dagobah, namely passing down what he had learned. Skywalker lamented over the loss of the texts, but Yoda slyly stated that although the texts held wisdom, 'page turners, they were not', and they did not contain anything Rey did not already have with her. Skywalker tried to explain that by failing Ben he felt that he had failed the Jedi. Yoda admonished Skywalker for still \"constantly looking to the horizon,\" like he had when they met on Dagobah. Yoda explained that 'failure is the greatest teacher' and that failure was an essential part of what he had implored Skywalker to pass on so many years before.\nSkywalker later appeared at the Resistance base on Crait and greeted his sister for the first time in years, giving her Han's gold dice to remember him by. Reconciling his failure to stop Ren and for not being there to prevent Han's death, Skywalker resolved to finally confront Ren to buy the Resistance time to escape. Before Skywalker went to confront his nephew, he wordlessly greeted his old friend C-3PO.\nStepping outside, Skywalker was spotted and targeted by a barrage of cannon fire from multiple AT-M6 walkers, but when the fusillade came to a stop, Skywalker strolled out of the smoke completely unharmed. Ren, having witnessed the impossible feat, approached Skywalker on foot. Ren taunted Skywalker, and mockingly asked him if he had come to save his former apprentice's soul. But Skywalker acknowledged that he was not there to redeem him.\nEngaging his former master in combat, Ren charged at Skywalker but Skywalker simply danced around Ren without engaging in any form of counter attack. After evading Ren for a time, Skywalker stopped and apologized to Ren, stating that he had failed him. He also informed his former student that victory was not so certain as he believed; that the war was only beginning, and that the Jedi would continue through Rey. He then deactivated his lightsaber and offered to let Kylo strike him down, but warned him that doing so in anger would only cause him pain, just as killing Han had, and stated that in death, he would always be with his nephew. Unknown to Kylo, Luke had sensed that Rey had lifted all the rocks blocking the exit of the Resistance base so they could escape to fight another day.\nRen ignored all these warnings and slashed Skywalker across the torso. Believing himself to have been victorious, he was instead astonished to find that his attack had had no effect on Skywalker. He walked over to his former master and tentatively ran him through, and discovered that Luke was not physically present; he was in fact still on Ahch-To, projecting an illusion of himself through the Force. The illusion was tailored to have the maximum effect on Ren, as Luke portrayed himself as he had last appeared to his nephew before they came to blows. Likewise, he portrayed himself as wielding Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, knowing that it would have more effect on Ren than if he had used his green blade.\nSkywalker taunted Ren one last time, and his image faded into nothingness. Light-years away, Skywalker collapsed from the mental stress necessary to sustain such a lifelike illusion, which Ren realized meant that Luke would become one with the Force. As he sat down on the cliff where he first trained Rey, Luke beheld the twin suns of Ahch-To in their final descent towards the horizon. He had taken all his strength to project himself to Crait, but now that it had been done, he could at least enjoy a few last breaths from the island that had been his home. Luke Skywalker knew that he was going to die, but it was something he accepted; death was the way of all things, even the stars. Though unsure if it was real or just a memory, Skywalker heard the familiar and comforting voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, urging him to let go, and so he did. Silhouetted by the binary sunset on a horizon much like the one he gazed upon as a boy and realizing that he was to step into a larger world, Luke Skywalker—Jedi Master, ace pilot, galactic legend and son of the Chosen One—passed away, joining his father and old masters as one with the Force with a feeling of peace and purpose. Luke Skywalker's final thoughts were that his life on the realm of the living had ended in the same way it began: by the light of two suns.\nFollowing his death, Leia took up Luke's mantle as Rey's Jedi mentor, and Skywalker's spirit continued to urge his sister to become one with the Force, sensing her declining health, but she persistently refused until Rey and the Resistance were ready to stand on their own.\nOne year after becoming one with the Force, Luke spoke to Leia once more, shortly before her death, beckoning her to show her son Ben she still loved him, reminding his sister that if Vader could become Anakin again, Kylo Ren could be Ben Solo again. Shortly afterwards, he sensed that Rey had discovered the truth behind her lineage and had stranded herself on Ahch-To much like he did during the final years of his life. As she threw her lightsaber into the wreckage of her ship, Luke appeared and grabbed it out of the air. Admitting that he was wrong in exiling himself, Luke consoled her that her legacy would not be defined by her bloodline but by her heart\nand her actions. When Rey lamented that Kylo Ren destroyed the final Sith marker that led to where the resurrected Emperor was residing, Luke mirrored the words of Yoda, stating that she had everything she needed. As a parting gift, Luke gifted Rey his sister's lightsaber and raised his old X-Wing from the depths of the ocean for Rey to use and travel to Exegol.\nRey could hear Luke among the numerous voices of the Jedi of the past shortly before she received the inner strength to overcome Darth Sidious. As the girl rose from the ground, Skywalker assured her that the Force would always be with her, and after she finally destroyed the Emperor by deflecting his Force lightning using Luke's and Leia's original lightsabers, he appeared one more time with his sister on Tatooine and watched from afar as Rey buried both of the weapons at the old Lars Homestead finally albeit posthumously formally earning the title of Jedi Master with his role as her mentor completed. The girl adopted the name Skywalker following Luke's statement that one's heart and actions defined one's legacy rather than one's bloodline.\nAfter his death, Skywalker's belongings, including his green lightsaber, were gathered by the Caretakers and stored with the other Jedi artifacts that they preserved alongside the temple on the Ahch-To island. The tale of Skywalker's stand against Ren and the First Order at Crait spread across the galaxy. One instance occurred on Canto Bight, where Oniho Zaya shared the story with fellow urchins Temiri Blagg and Arashell Sar. As word of this moment spread, Skywalker's sacrifice showed others that it was possible to stand defiant against the First Order, and his legend reinvigorated a spark of hope.\nSkywalker's loss represented a heavy blow to the Resistance. When Temmin Wexley and Karé Kun informed the retired Wedge Antilles and Norra Wexley about their losses since the Battle of Crait, Antilles felt devastated upon learning of the death of his former wingmate, asking himself if the Jedi weren't supposed to live forever.\nRey, Dameron, and Rose Tico speculated whether it was Luke who freed the Zixon from the Empire.\nOne of the most influential people in the entire galaxy, Luke Skywalker's accomplishments were remembered for decades after the Battle of Endor. Within the annals of the Resistance, basic training would see all pilots in its Starfighter Corps learning the Skywalker Swoop, which was based on Luke's piloting abilities during the Galactic Civil War. Many remembered him for destroying the Death Star and killing the Emperor, and as such viewed him as a hero of mythic proportions. Resistance pilot Jessika Pava considered Skywalker to be the greatest X-wing pilot of all time. Some questioned whether or not Luke could have used his powers for evil, while others simply viewed him as a myth. Skywalker's unlikely story of going from a simple farm boy on Tatooine to a galactic legend gave hope to restless youths on a number of worlds.\nIn his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for his present surroundings, and even a bit brash. Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and often had little regard for his own personal safety. According to Yoda, he had a \"gaping need\" for a connection to his father and to have a family. Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained \"about everything\" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying, a trait that many people could infer. He once confided in Leia that he felt Tatooine had never felt like a home to him.\nAs his skills in the Force progressed, and especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker became more patient and seasoned. He was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years; however, he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone, and believing that Vader was redeemable. He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the Clone Wars. Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger.\nBased on observing Owen and Beru Lars, Skywalker grew up believing in showing his love to people rather than telling them. When he and Nakari Kelen fell in love, he demonstrated his feelings for her, but he did not tell her how he felt; he regretted that as grieved for her death alongside the then-recent losses of his aunt, uncle, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. While stranded on Hubin, Skywalker was instantly smitten with Tula Markona and they shared a kiss, but it would be a one-time event. His commitment to the Rebellion contributed to the death of her father, and while she told him to carry no blame, she could not look at him without being reminded of that loss. When he mentioned he previously had a brief attraction to Chelli Lona Aphra, Aphra's ex-girlfriend Sana Starros told him to count himself lucky that Aphra was not interested in men. Skywalker and Reyé Hollis, a sergeant in the Rebel Alliance Special Forces at Echo Base, each appreciated the other man's smile and pleasantly-scented hair.\nFollowing the end of the Empire and the death of the Sith Order, Skywalker came to have great hope for the future of the Jedi, coming to believe that if a single Jedi could help bring back balance to the Force, then a restored Jedi Order perhaps could maintain that achieved peace and prevent the dark side of the Force from ever regaining its hold on the galaxy. This belief led Luke to scour worlds for the remaining Jedi texts and gathered a new class of apprentices under his tutelage. During his brief time as Grogu's master, Luke had to suppress his more sentimental side and be more professional in an effort to successfully pass on the Jedi values to the child.\nAfter Ben Solo, his nephew, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Skywalker became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi. He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Solo's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order, as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her drawn towards the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo Ren to return to the light. By this point, Skywalker had come to regard Ren as his responsibility and his greatest failure.\nHowever, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Skywalker finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Skywalker showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Solo's fall. Skywalker realized that instead of blaming himself, he blamed the Jedi for his failures. His belief of the Jedi being romanticized deities with a legacy of failure remained, but gained realization that if one stripped away the sacred temples, lightsabers, and even the legends about them, they were just good people the galaxy needed.\nIn the end, Skywalker willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on. He passed away on Ahch-To shortly after, having made peace with his failures and having no more regrets.\nThough he received little training, Luke Skywalker had a natural talent for lightsaber combat. Luke's initial training with the weapon of the Jedi came during a brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a training remote on the way to Alderaan, where he learned the initial position and the four defensive postures. Though his level proved inadequate during his first, but brief duel against Darth Vader on Cymoon 1, his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin, and culminated with him besting the Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.\nLike most Jedi, Skywalker was adept at redirecting blaster fire. During his mission to Rodia, he tried his hand at Jar'Kai for the first time with his and Huulik's lightsaber. Although he killed a ghest, he admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of \"panicked reflexes and really good weapons.\" He received further training from the \"Gamemaster,\" a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt's MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory abilities.\nAfter a brief time of training with Yoda, Skywalker revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin. Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son and cut off his hand, proving his superiority. Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Skywalker showed his improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Leia to the dark side, an enraged Skywalker unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.\nLater in life, Skywalker taught multiple students in the art of lightsaber combat, including his nephew Ben Solo, who would later become his strongest student and destroy his Jedi Order. Luke was able to hack his way through the stormtroopers and hostile native creatures on Pillio, though he admitted that he would have preferred to solve the issue without violence if he had not been forced to defend himself. During his rescue of Grogu from Moff Gideon, Skywalker easily destroyed a platoon of Dark Troopers with his lightsaber and the Force. Several years later, Skywalker effortlessly overpowered the Knights of Ren, seamlessly dodging their attacks and destroying their weapons before using the Force to disarm them. When fighting an angry Rey using her quarterstaff, Skywalker, using a metal rod, blocked her shots after fluidly dodging her initial assault and hit her once before disarming her. Later, on Crait, he avoided all of Kylo Ren's attacks without needing to use his lightsaber to block, distracting the First Order long enough for the remaining members of the Resistance to escape.\nLike his father, Skywalker possessed a uniquely powerful connection to the Force, and became one of the most powerful Force wielders in galactic history. Indeed, Darth Sidious believed that Skywalker was strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith. Most of Luke's understanding of the Force came from his own research, exploration, and experience as he only had a few days Kenobi's mentorship before his demise, Yoda's one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi's sporadic guidance from beyond the Netherworld of the Force.\nAfter learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to sense through it, and took the habit of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware of his surroundings. In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father, and telepathically calling his sister. He was capable of seeing and hearing those who had become one with the Force. By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a shot that many thought was impossible.\nAfter obtaining Huulik's lightsaber and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.\nBy the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though not without difficulty. Under Yoda's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while meditating. Shortly after the revelation that Darth Vader was his father, Luke Skywalker lashed out with the Force, hurtling a squadron of Tie Fighters into each other. In another outburst, he accidentally cracked the window of a starship.\nSkywalker eventually learned other uses, such as mind control techniques. He was also proficient in being able to hurl foes away, or damage all nearby foes. Luke could use the Force to make great leaps.\nDuring his rescue of Grogu, Skywalker used the Force to throw dark Troopers off ledges, force push away or push crates into them and then simply destroying them with his lightsaber or simply crushing them with simply the Force.\nSkywalker was skilled at doing mind tricks, as well as performing Force-enhanced jumps. He also demonstrated the ability to have visions several times. Skywalker could disconnect himself from the Force, and he was able to renew his connection within a short amount of time. Luke Skywalker understood the dark side powers mind probe, Force-bond, and Force lightning well enough to write about them. He also studied Force healing and many esoteric Force powers.\nWhen facing the Knights of Ren, Skywalker effortlessly Force-pushed the Knights of Ren and telekinetically disarmed and destroyed their weapons. Shortly after recovering the ability to use the Force, Luke detected Rey and Ren's bond and in his anger, he Force pushed Rey's hut into pieces around the two and broke the connection. When defending himself against Rey, Luke pried an antenna from the roof of a hut and summoned it to himself in seconds, then managed to keep himself suspended off the ground after being knocked down by Rey. Whereas Ren noted that the effort of attempting Force projection would kill Rey, Skywalker was able to use the complete version of this ability; he gave all of himself into the Force, which allowed him to interact with others by sending a life-like image of himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo Ren and the First Order. The projection was so powerful that C-3PO acknowledged his presence, and Ren was tricked into believing it was the real him. Skywalker maintained it for a prolonged period of time, although the strain ultimately proved to be fatal and killed the Jedi Master.\nSkywalker was one of the few Jedi who was able to truly become one with the Force and preserve his consciousness as a Force spirit. As a Force spirit, Skywalker was able to physically interact with the living world, which he demonstrated when he caught Rey's lightsaber after she threw it, and when he lifted his X-wing from the oceans of Ahch-To and repaired it so that Rey could travel to Exegol.\nSkywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself . He also managed to destroy an Interdictor vessel on his own while piloting the Desert Jewel, although he acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the nick of time. He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease, outmaneuvering an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor that was trying to get a lock on him. In fact, Skywalker had a talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.\nHe was a native speaker of Galactic Basic Standard, and although Skywalker could not understand Shyriiwook, he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca's moods by his tone and expression before the Battle of Yavin. After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak.\nSkywalker was adept in unarmed combat. He demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground.\nShortly afterwards he found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shadaa. Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the rest.\nHe found himself in another similar situation on Horox III, where he defeated an entire cantina of alien thugs with the help of Aphra and her Wookiee bounty hunter. Skywalker knocked out the Commander Kanchar, a hulking cybernetic enhanced man with a single punch after outsmarting him.\nIn his later years, Skywalker displayed such skill that he was able to easily punch aside a Knight of Ren and disarm Rey of her quarterstaff before she could react.\nLuke Skywalker wielded at least three lightsabers during the Galactic Civil War. The first was his father's former weapon, that was retrieved and given to him by Obi-Wan Kenobi. He wielded this weapon for three years before losing it, and the hand holding it, in a duel against Darth Vader on the cloud city on Bespin.\nThe second one he obtained shortly after his visit to a Jedi outpost on Tempes, He would use this one to defend himself against foes like Commander Ellian Zahra.\nEventually, Skywalker built himself a new weapon, with a green blade, that he used to rescue his friends from Jabba the Hutt and during his final duel with Darth Vader.\nSkywalker would carry at least two blasters. The first one was a Defender sporting blaster pistol that he carried during the Award ceremony that occurred shortly after the Battle of Yavin.. The second one was a blaster pistol similar to a DL-44.\nFor most of his appearances in Star Wars saga, Luke Skywalker was portrayed by actor Mark Hamill. For his appearance in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, Skywalker was portrayed as a infant by Aidan Barton. In Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD he was voiced by Joshua Fardon.\nIn George Lucas' original script, Luke Skywalker was meant to be called Luke Starkiller.\nGeorge Lucas's sequel trilogy outline involved a Luke who had fallen into a dark state of mind, living in self-imposed exile in the first Jedi Temple.  However, Lucas did not give a reason for Luke's change of attitude. Michael Arndt's initial script for The Force Awakens had Luke first appear halfway through the film, but Arndt came to feel that Luke's direct involvement would upstage Rey and the audience would cease caring about her. Ultimately, he, J.J. Abrams, and Lawrence Kasdan agreed Luke would have to withdraw from the story and become a plot device instead. Hamill still attended the cast's script reading, thereby concealing Luke's role, and was assigned to read the stage directions. \"It was a way of having  be part of every scene, every moment, not just spiritually or thematically or narratively, but actually,\" Abrams said. \"Having his voice in it made the read through a better experience for everyone.\"\nHamill was initially concerned by how Luke was written in The Last Jedi. \"I got into trouble because… I was quoted as saying to Rian  that I fundamentally disagree with everything you decided about Luke, and it was inartfully  phrased. What I was, was surprised at how he saw Luke. And it took me a while to get around to his way of thinking, but once I was there it was a thrilling experience. I hope it will be for the audience too.\" Johnson explained: \"Honestly, that came out of what I felt was a necessity, because it came from where he was at the end of Episode VII, The Force Awakens. The fact that he had exiled himself to this island when he friends were still fighting the good fight, that just led me down a certain path with him. I couldn't really see any other alternative.\"; \"Knowing that Luke is a hero, knowing Luke from growing up, I know he must think he's doing the right thing by taking himself out of the equation. And because he's the last Jedi, by taking the Jedi out of the equation, by saying, 'I'm taking the Jedi out of this fight,' he must think that's the best thing for the galaxy.\" Hamill agreed that an old, comfortable Luke would have been too reminiscent of Obi-Wan, but his issue was that \"'Jedis  don't give up.'\" Johnson added the back-and-forth to get Luke's character to make sense helped \"made me really dig in and justify the choices I had made to bring Luke to where he was at. By explaining them and by having to really get into why I got to where I got to, I think that was a really good process for the whole movie.\" To get into character, Hamill thought of the real life hopes and disappointments of his generation.\nJohnson deemed it best to conclude Luke's Last Jedi arc with him dying partly because, \"honestly, thinking about the number of characters we have on our plate going into the next movie  it just vaguely seemed good to me that putting Luke in another realm could open possibilities for his possible involvement in the next one. As opposed to him just being another character that had to be juggled into the plot, if that makes sense.\" He was unconcerned that the audience might feel unable to cope with Luke's death so soon after Han's murder in The Force Awakens, as Luke's passing was victorious and peaceful, not a violent defeat. Hamill was particularly not keen on Luke dying, feeling he had to return a triumphant hero, but Johnson argued that \"if Skywalker just came back like he did in the original trilogy, an optimistic fighter, he's just an older version of Rey. And Johnson needed someone to bounce up against Rey.\" Hamill said his primary lesson from the experience was how, \"At times, I'd say to Rian, 'We gotta think of what the audience wants,' \"And he'd say, 'No, we've gotta think of what we want.'\"\nHamill later expressed regret for his comments regarding the film, stating that such creative differences are common, but usually remain private and that Johnson had made a great film. He later disclosed he had similarly disputed the way the character was written in Return of the Jedi, revealing \"I read  Jedi and thought, 'Wait a sec! I thought I was heading toward the struggle of heading to the Dark Side. I'm in black. I have a glove. I see a trend here.'\"\nThe Rise of Skywalker reveals Luke and Leia knew about Rey's ancestry, despite the revelation not having been conceived during production of the previous two films. Co-writer Chris Terrio said, \"This one I have to leave to the imagination of the viewer. But, I don't think it would be wrong to assume that Luke's Force Ghost would seek out his Force-sensitive, Jedi-trained sister.\"\nIn The Mandalorian's \"Chapter 16: The Rescue,\" Max Lloyd Jones physically portrayed the character, with Matt Rugetti serving as a stunt double. Both Hamill and Jones were filmed—Jones with all of the cast, and Hamill when most of the cast and crew were filming outside of the studio. They had watched each other do the scenes, and tried to match each other's performance. Lola's digital de-aging was used to make the character look like young Luke Skywalker, and the voice was completely synthesised using an application called Respeecher. To prevent this appearance from leaking, the scripts had Plo Koon written instead of Luke Skywalker, and a concept art of Plo Koon destroying dark troopers was created.\nIn The Book of Boba Fett, Graham Hamilton was the performance artist for the character, with Scott Lang serving as a stunt double. The voice was artificially created with Respeecher. Rosario Dawson, who played Ahsoka Tano in The Book of Boba Fett, didn't learn that her character would interact with Luke Skywalker until the day of filming. She was very excited that she got to work with Mark Hamill.\nIn Stuart Beattie's script for an Obi-Wan Kenobi feature film, when Kenobi left Tatooine, he left clone trooper Cody in charge of Luke Skywalker, which was meant to be a side plot that the film would cut away to. Cody was planned as a way to show how disconnected Kenobi was from the Force due to forcing his will upon young Skywalker in a manner similar to when Superman lost his powers in the film Superman II. Kenobi would fall in with refugees that are fleeing from the Empire. Tao, the lead refugee woman, took Kenobi to a sacred shrine and instructed the Jedi Master to let their goddess speak to him. Kenobi was then on Mustafar and was attacked by Luke Skywalker played by a de-aged Mark Hamill. Skywalker almost killed Kenobi, but he snapped out the vision and realized that putting his guilt on Skywalker would turn him to the dark side. Beattie was excited to be part of the first Star Wars project to bring back Skywalker.\nSkywalker was portrayed by Grant Feely as a young kid in Part I, Part V, and Part VI of the Obi-Wan Kenobi limited television series. In April, 2021, Feely's agent sent him the audition for a role. He then filmed an audition for \"Boy - Untitled Disney+ Series,\" not knowing the role was for Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he did not think anything of it. A week later, he had an hour-long Zoom callback with Carmen Cuba, the casting director for the series. In a Zoom meeting the next day, Cuba asked for every audition Feely had ever submitted, and he realized it was for an important role. In early June, he had a director's callback with director Deborah Chow. When he was in Hawaii during the end of June, he was asked if he could come to Los Angeles. He was not able to go, so they flew him to LA to do an in-person audition with Chow. In early July, Chow called Feely to offer him the role of Luke Skywalker. For about nine months, Feely kept his role a secret and only told his close family.\nFeely wanted to do research for his portrayal, however Chow told him to not watch any Star Wars movies so that he could act like a regular boy instead of how Mark Hamill played the character in the original trilogy. Chow explained that Skywalker does not learn about the Force until he's around twenty years old. He was not told anything about Skywalker or any other characters in the series. When the rock scene of Skywalker being chased by the Inquisitor Reva was being filmed, Feely was in a harness running along the top of the set.\nEven though Skywalker's appearances in various LEGO Star Wars content are not a part of the official Star Wars canon, they are set in a unique, continuous universe.\nEven though Skywalker was alluded to during the series, Skywalker made three physical appearances in the LEGO Star Wars television series, LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures in the episodes \"Crossing Paths,\" \"Trouble on Tibalt,\" and \"Return of the Return of the Jedi\" where he was voiced by Eric Bauza.\nSkywalker also made appearance in the five-episode limited series, LEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales, a series that re-told the story of the live-action Star Wars films, from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace through Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, albeit in a rather silly and exaggerated fashion, as well as a similarly-portrayed adaptation of the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Droids in Distress.\" Skywalker was once again voiced by Eric Bauza in the series.\nFor the LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens video game, Mark Hamill reprised his role as Skywalker, however through archive footage and not newly-recorded dialogue.\nSkywalker would make an appearance in The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special, once again voiced by Eric Bauza.\nSkywalker would make an appearance in LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales in the segments, \"The Lost Boy\" and \"The Wookiee Paw\". He was once again voiced by Eric Bauza.\nIn the cinematic virtual-reality game, Star Wars: Trials on Tatooine, After Skywalker had many journeys to the distant corners of the galaxy, uncovering secrets about the legacy of the Jedi, he felt ready to create a new Jedi Order. He took on a padawan learner, who was hoping to join the Jedi Order, and sent the Padawan on a mission to Tatooine to await a delivery from Han Solo. The Millennium Falcon landed, and R2-D2 handed the Padawan a lightsaber. However, remnants of the Galactic Empire began an operation to attack the Padawan.\nIn this game where he is voiced by David Menkin, Skywalker is presented as having tried to deal with the rising darkness of Ben Solo during the time of the Jedi academy in a calm and non-threatening way, only drawing his lightsaber to block an attack from the younger man.",
