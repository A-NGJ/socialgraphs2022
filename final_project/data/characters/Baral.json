She recorded several holograms about the fate of the Outcasts following their exodus to the Promised Land, which were discovered by a Republic-allied individual on Taris. She was eventually succeeded by Ku-ki.\nBaral was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears in a hologram found by the Republic characters as part of the \"Chasing History\" mission.",
