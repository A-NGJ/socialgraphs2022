 "content": "Tergeth Dilorr was a male Human who was a part of the Ho'Din terrorist Ort Hoogra-D'En's network.\nDilorr had formerly served in the Imperial Navy as a conscript who drifted from planet to planet after leaving the service. He eventually signed on with Hoogra-D'En's group for the money they were offering, though he later developed the same anti-Imperial point of view as the organization's leader. However, he disagreed with the group's preference of working alone and thought that Hoogra-D'En would accomplish more if he joined forces with the Rebel Alliance.",
