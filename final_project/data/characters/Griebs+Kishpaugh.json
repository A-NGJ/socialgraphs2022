 "content": "Griebs Kishpaugh was a Human male who served as a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic and later joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars.\nKishpaugh joined the Republic Military as a way to support his family. He expected to remain in the local reserves, but he was instead sent offworld, away from his loved ones. In 22 BBY, Kishpaugh switched his allegiances to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who offered him credits, protection from Republic retribution, and a return to his homeworld. Before Kishpaugh could escape in his shuttle with the aid of his pilot droid Z-37, Clone Sergeant CT-7719 confronted and stopped him. Kishpaugh was brought into Republic custody.",
