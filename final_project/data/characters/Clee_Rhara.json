 "content": "Clee Rhara was a red-headed female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final decades of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive Human female, Clee Rhara was a contemporary of Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl, receiving training in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. After years of training as a Guardian and specializing as an ace in the Jedi Starfighter Corps, Clee Rhara attained the rank of Jedi Master.\nSelecting the young Initiate Garen Muln as her Padawan, Rhara worked with the Starfighter Corps to establish a piloting academy on Centax-2, one of Coruscant's moons. While Rhara worked to see the academy open, many members of the Galactic Senate opposed funding for the Starfighter Corps' academy. Rumors were propagated in the Senate that Rhara had sabotaged the project herself in order to prompt further funding. The Order saw the funding bill come to a vote where it was undermined through the secret machinations of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. The facility became too expensive to maintain and was eventually shut down.\nDespite the project's failure, Rhara and Muln were kept busy with assignments from the Jedi High Council. Training Muln to knighthood, the pair continued to work with each other on missions. In 25 BBY, Rhara and Muln accompanied Master Siri Tachi and her Padawan Ferus Olin to the Xanlanner system on an assignment. En route, the Jedi received a distress signal from Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on TY44. They picked up Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker on Vanqor, where they had crash-landed. The team then traveled to Typha-Dor to help them thwart the Vanqor invasion.",
