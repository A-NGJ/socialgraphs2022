 "content": "Yrrcanna was a black furred Wookiee who participated in fights in the Dool Arena of the The Broken Tusk on Reuss VIII. He was a former Imperial slave who retained a moody and violent nature following his freedom.\nYrrcanna went from being a slave to a top ranked contender in the Dool Arena. He was a crowd favorite and one of the few contenders who had a real chance of dethroning the reigning champion, Tull Raine.\nYrrcanna had aggressive impulses and was prone to entering fits of berserker rage. This proved to be a valuable asset in the arena, however, and he used his ferocity to rise through the ranks.\nHe had black fur but often wore gold glow-paint that depicted ancient clan markings to both intimidate his opponents and pay homage to his ancestors.\nAs expected of a Wookiee pit fighter, Yrrcanna was very skilled with his fists. Unlike other contenders he did not rely on melee weapons and instead relied on his brute strength to win matches. He was also a smart fighter being able to both parry and dodge with great agility. He was also skilled with a bowcaster although he never was able to use it in the arena.\nYrrcanna was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.\nAlthough the image depicted him with some form of blade, neither his equipment list nor bio mentioned ever using a blade in the arena.",
