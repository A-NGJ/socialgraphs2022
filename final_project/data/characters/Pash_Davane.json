 "content": "Pash Davane, nicknamed Bash, was a human female who lived on the planet Skorii-Lei during the Galactic Civil War. At some point the Rebellion destroyed the primary industry on Skorii-Lei, causing Davane to go from being an engineer to lifting crates. She owned a droid called Bruce.\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, princess Leia Organa arrived on the planet. Leia got information but she was hurt before she could get the information back to Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca who were waiting for her aboard the Millennium Falcon. Pash took Leia back to her home and healed her before helping her escape the Galactic Empire and bounty hunters.\nPash Davane was a strong willed engineer who didn't believe in either the Empire or the Rebellion, and thought of them as two forces fighting, leaving devastation behind, with little regard for the people.\nDavane was very strong and muscular, and was nicknamed Bash after she bashed someone in the head with a rock. However, she disliked the nickname.",
