 "content": "Mitar was the King of Daimar during the last years of the Galactic Republic and the leader of the Lamont Dynasty of Daimar. His children were Erra, Rondar, and Torrin and his granddaughter was Princess Winera.\nAfter the Galactic Empire had blockaded Daimar, Mitar sent some of Daimar's most important figures, including Alet Komain, Jedi Shen-Ji Collun, and his own granddaughter, Princess Winera, to the planet Byrsym to meet with Mitar's son, Torrin. Torrin was leading an anti-Imperial resistance group, and was pleased to safely receive the group, and protect them on Byrsysm so that they would not fall into Imperial hands. Mitar, however, stayed in Daimar with his son Rondar.",
