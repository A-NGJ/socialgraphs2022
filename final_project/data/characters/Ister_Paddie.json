 "content": "Ister Paddie was a human male senator of the Galactic Republic who served in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's Loyalist Committee during the Separatist Crisis. In 22 BBY, he watched a holographic message from the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi while in Palpatine's office on the planet Coruscant.\nIster Paddie was a human male senator who served in the Galactic Senate of the Galactic Republic during the Separatist Crisis. He was a member of the Loyalist Committee, a group of senators who fostered support for the rule of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. In 22 BBY, Paddie was part of a group including other committee members, Jedi, and the chancellor himself, who viewed a holographic message from Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi in Palpatine's office in the Senate Office Building on the planet Coruscant.\nIn the message, Kenobi, who was on the planet Geonosis, reported that he had followed the bounty hunter Jango Fett to a series of droid foundries where the Trade Federation were taking delivery of a droid army. He also reported that the Federation's Viceroy, Nute Gunray, was behind the recent assassination attempts on Loyalist Committee member Padm√© Amidala and that the Corporate Alliance and Commerce Guild were forming an alliance with Count Dooku, head of a separatist movement trying to break away from the Republic. Before he could finish his report, Kenobi was attacked by a droideka which walked into view of the recording before the transmission ended. The Jedi and Republic ultimately sent forces to Geonosis to battle the Separatists based on Kenobi's report, beginning the Clone Wars.\nIster Paddie had light skin, black hair, and brown eyes.\nWhile in Palpatine's office, Paddie wore an ornate golden outfit from Halbara, including an elaborate black headdress.\nIster Paddie was portrayed by William Clay in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which was released on May 16, 2002. Clay went uncredited for the role but was credited with working as a digital model development and/or construction artist on the film. His ornate headdress is reminiscent of those worn by the Imperial dignitaries introduced in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. It is also similar to headgear shown in concept sketches for citizens of Bespin created for the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, the character was first identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where Paddie was first mentioned prior to the release of Attack of the Clones in HoloNet News Vol. 531 #47, a March 14, 2002 issue published on the HoloNet News website as part of the marketing for the film.
