 "content": "\"Lady Blue\" was a Rebel Alliance starfighter pilot stationed aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty in the months leading up to the Battle of Endor. She was considered attractive and held the title of Miss Liberty in 2 ABY. Lady Blue was set up to go on a date with fellow pilot Ace Azzameen by Ace's brother Emon, but she was killed on a recon mission to the Japai system before she got the chance. Emon was unable to attend her funeral, and Ace never got to meet her in person, though he kept a picture she sent him in his quarters.\nA female Human, Lady Blue joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a starfighter pilot in the Alliance Starfighter Corps at some point prior to 2 ABY. Assigned to the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty, she entered and won the Miss Liberty pageant in 2 ABY and became known by the call sign \"Lady Blue.\"\nFollowing the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Lady Blue met the Alliance-allied pilot Emon Azzameen, whose family had sought refuge with the Rebels after being declared traitors to the Galactic Empire. Azzameen told her about his younger brother, Ace, who was also serving as a starfighter pilot aboard the Liberty, and she decided that she would like to meet the young pilot. Lady Blue sent an e-mail to Ace, asking if he would be interested in a date and saying that she would contact him to arrange a time after returning from a recon mission to the Japai system. She also sent him a picture of herself.\nHowever, Lady Blue was killed near the Japai system, along with her fellow pilots Tabba and Kraigg, before she had the chance to meet Ace in person. A funeral service was held for all three pilots aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Defiance shortly after their deaths. Emon later sent an e-mail to his brother apologizing for not being able to attend the funeral and for how the situation had turned out. Ace kept the picture Lady Blue sent him of her on the wall of his room aboard his personal YT-2000 light freighter, the Otana.\nLady Blue had light skin and blonde hair. She was considered attractive and was chosen as Miss Liberty in 2 ABY. Emon Azzameen felt that she would be a good match for his brother, Ace, and attempted to set the two up for a date. Though she generally refrained from dating her fellow pilots, Emon's description of Ace interested her, and she decided to make him an exception and ask the other pilot out.\nLady Blue was created for the 1999 LucasArts video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, in which she is the subject of a series of e-mails to the player character, Ace Azzameen, as the two attempt to arrange a date. An e-mail from Emon to Ace Azzameen regarding Lady Blue comes before the Battle 3 mission, \"Supply Rebels with Warheads.\" At the same time, a picture of Lady Blue appears in Ace's room. If the player zooms in on this image, a caption underneath mentions that she was killed before meeting Ace. However, Lady Blue goes on to e-mail Ace after the mission, and an e-mail announcing her death and funeral arrangements does not appear until after the mission \"Recon Imperial Research Center.\"",
