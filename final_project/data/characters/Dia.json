 "content": "Dia was a Human female who lived on the planet Taris during the Jedi Civil War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She worked as a waitress in Javyar's Cantina and while working there, a man named Holdan began forcing himself on her. In retaliation, she struck him with her vibroblade, injuring and humiliating him. Holdan responded by putting a bounty on Dia's head, forcing her to hide in an Upper City apartment. While hiding out there, she met the Republic soldier Revan, who offered his help and was able to convince Holdan to drop the bounty.\nDia lived on the Outer Rim city-world of Taris during the Old Sith Wars, a period of conflict between the Galactic Republic and various Sith factions. During the Jedi Civil War between the Republic and the Darth Revan's Sith Empire, Dia was working as a waitress at Javyar's Cantina in the Lower City. One day, she caught the attention of a man named Holdan, a henchman for the Exchange's local crime boss, Davik Kang. When the drunk man attempted to force himself upon her, Dia defended herself with a vibroblade, humiliating him in front of his friends and giving him a scar. To maintain his reputation, he put out an illegal bounty of three hundred credits on Dia, and the woman was reduced to hiding in an Upper City apartment amongst illegal aliens. Because of Holdan's connections to Kang, the local authorities turned a blind eye. She barely made enough credits to get by, and thus was unable to pay off the bounty. Too afraid for her life to leave the apartment, Dia soon lost touch with the political affairs of the outside world.\nIn 3956 BBY, following a space battle above the planet, several Republic escape pods crashed down onto the ecumenopolis. One of these pods contained both the Republic war hero Carth Onasi and the former Sith Lord Revan. At the time, Revan was amnesic and believed himself to be a Republic soldier. Revan and Onasi took refuge in the Upper City's South Apartments, attempting to stay out of sight of the Sith, who had imposed martial law and a planet-wide quarantine on Taris. Their hideout happened to be next door to Dia's apartment.\nThe amnesiac Dark Lord of the Sith found his way through her locked door and approached Dia. She was surprised and berated him for bursting in. Despite his apologies, she remained upset, though she noted he was more polite than Holdan. Revan asked about Holdan, but Dia hesitated to give much information, as she didn't trust him. However, Revan was able to convince Dia to tell the full story, and she explained her plight to him. Revan offered to help remove the bounty, though Dia doubted he could. She directed him to Javyar's Cantina, where Holdan enjoyed spending time, and wished Revan luck on talking sense into him. Revan tried to ask Dia more questions about the planet, but she was sheltered from any news and thus was unable to help.\nRevan found and confronted Holdan in Javyar's Cantina. Though Holdan was reluctant to remove the bounty, wishing to save his reputation, Revan and his party were able to convince him otherwise. Holdan went to the bounty office located within the cantina and called off the bounty with Zax the Hutt, an associate of Davik Kang.\nRevan returned to Dia's apartment to tell her of his success. Upon hearing the news, she was overjoyed and thanked him profusely. While she didn't have much, Dia offered to reward Revan with a family heirloom. However, Revan refused the reward, claiming that helping her was all the thanks he needed. The woman offered a final goodbye and thanks to Revan, and was able to come out of hiding.\nDia was a light-skinned Human female with black hair and brown eyes.\nWhen Dia received a bounty on her head, she thought that the most sensible course was to hide away in her apartment, refusing to risk even leaving the complex. Though this was motivated by fear, when attacked or faced with unavoidable danger, she believed in—and was capable of—making a brave stand to prove she was not as defenseless as she seemed. She could be defiant and did not shy away from criticizing the misdeeds of others, such as burglary or harassment.\nDia wore a green tunic with a gray undertunic and gray pants. She also had brown knee length boots, dark brown gloves, and a metallic utility belt with several pouches. She wore her hair in a ponytail secured with a brown tie.\nWhile she was a waitress, she carried a vibroblade on her person, which she used against Holdan.\nDia appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic released by BioWare. Player interactions with her are optional, though her dialogue can start the \"Dia's Bounty\" side quest. This quest may be fulfilled in several ways, changing the players alignment accordingly. In order to start the quest, the player must pass a persuasion check or threaten Dia. Alternatively, the player may refuse or avoid the quest entirely. The 2008 reference book The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia confirms that Revan completed the quest, stating that Revan convinced Holdan to remove the bounty.\nThere are three ways to convince Holdan to drop the bounty and receive light side points. The player can pay him two hundred credits to cancel the bounty or persuade him to cancel without paying. If Bastila Shan is in the party during the confrontation, she will use Force persuasion to have him withdraw the bounty should the player fail to convince Holdan. If the player has Dia's bounty removed, she will offer the player an item. The player can either accept it or either refuse and obtain more light side points. The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia does not specify which of these options was taken.\nIn an alternative dark side option, the player can kill Dia to claim the bounty. If Carth Onasi is in the party, he objects to the act, giving the player chance to reconsider the choice. The player may decide to spare her or proceed with the attack. If Dia is killed, the player can collect a three hundred credit bounty from Zax. The player may persuade Zax to raise the reward to four hundred credits.",
