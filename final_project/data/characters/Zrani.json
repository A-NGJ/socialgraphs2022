 "content": "Zrani was a female Wistie, one of the glowing fairy-folk of the forest moon of Endor, prior to the Battle of Endor. She was captured by the Dulok Agluk, put in a lamp and used to light the way to him and the four adolescent Ewoks in a cave where the Griagh was hiding. Princess Kneesaa was able to communicate with her.\nLater on, as the Griagh attacked, Zrani sacrificed her life to speed up and direct the weakened Sunstar tossed at the beast by Logray. At the victory ceremony after the battle, Chief Chirpa presented a flame which would forever burn in the memory of Zrani.",
