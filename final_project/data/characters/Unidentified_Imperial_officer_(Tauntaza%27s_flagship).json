 "content": "A human Imperial officer served in the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era aboard the flagship of Tauntaza, the governor of the planet Gabredor III. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the officer was present on the flagship when the Sith Lord Darth Vader boarded the ship to arrest the governor after she was exposed as a traitor to the Empire. When Vader arrived at the bridge, the officer and the ship's crew offered no resistance, and the officer stated to Vader that they felt there was some misunderstanding and that it could be cleared up once Tauntaza finished her mission. The officer then requested to Vader that he reconsider his hostile stance, though Vader ignored the officer and ordered one of the bridge's crew to open a communication channel with Vader's command ship and spoke with Admiral Firmus Piett. After, Vader asked the bridge's crew where the governor was.",
