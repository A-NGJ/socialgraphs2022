 "content": "Bol Chatak was a female Zabrak Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The master of Padawan Olee Starstone, she was killed by Darth Vader in the days following the execution of Contingency Order 66, a command which effectively disbanded the Order.\nBorn on Iridonia, Bol Chatak was discovered to be Force-sensitive and was turned over to the Jedi Order for education in the ways of the Force. Constructing a blue-bladed lightsaber and completing her Trials of Knighthood, Bol Chatak was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. Developing her skills with a lightsaber and enhancing her knowledge of the Force, after many years of study, Jedi Chatak achieved the rank of Jedi Master.\nOn a mission for the Jedi High Council during the Separatist Crisis, Master Chatak found herself introduced to Padawan Olee Starstone, the aspiring young apprentice of Chief Librarian of the Temple Archives, Jocasta Nu. While the two parted, their first meeting left a lasting impression. When the crisis between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems escalated into the Clone Wars, Master Chatak took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic and began leading clone troopers on fronts across the galaxy. As the war machine drummed on, the High Council wished to step up the training of several senior Padawans stationed at the Temple. Because of Chatak and Starstone's good relations, the Council of Reassignment tasked Chatak with the training of Starstone, pulling the girl from her studies in the Archives and forcing her into the role of Commander in the Grand Army.\nIn the third year of war, Chatak was dispatched to the Outer Rim world of Murkhana and was tasked with leading the defense of the planet from the Separatist Droid Army. Aided by Master Roan Shryne and 32nd Air Combat Wing, she led the campaign valiantly, eventually calling in reinforcements. Led by Master Saras Loorne, the additional troops saw the arrival of two Knights and Padawan Starstone. Serving alongside the clone commando unit of Ion Team, Chatak, Shryne and Starstone fought live soldiers of the Vibroblade Brigade as well as droids. As the Jedi reconnoitered a medcenter, the clones received a message from the Office of the Supreme Chancellor. All Jedi were to be killed in compliance with Order 66. While Commander Salvo prepared to ambush the Jedi, the commandos of Ion Team distracted their clone brothers enough to allow the Jedi to flee, unwilling to kill the Force-wielders without confirmation of the order.\nGoing to ground, Chatak and her two companions felt Master Loorne and the other Knights die as the clones turned their weapons on their former generals. Hiding out in the hilly areas surrounding the Murkhana City, the trio disguised themselves as Koorivar and camped out in an abandoned warehouse near Argente Tower. Regarding their beacon transceivers, the Jedi were bewildered when they discovered the High Council was requesting that all Jedi return to Coruscant. Attempting to get off planet to comply with the High Council's order, the Jedi observed the battle was over and the Republic was victorious. When the droids around them were suddenly powered down, the group was arrested by several clone troopers who believed them to be mercenaries.\nSpending four weeks in a crowded holding facility, the Jedi were eventually marched out, along with the other prisoners, onto a red-clay landing field that had been notched into one of the hillsides surrounding the city to see the arrival of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. Conversing with Commander Salvo, Vader was in the middle of admonishing Ion Team for disobeying a direct order when Master Chatak removed her disguise and leapt up to confront the Sith. Racing at the black armored figure with her blue-bladed lightsaber ablaze, Chatak met Vader's red blade in an intense battle. Landing a blow on his forearm, Chatak fought valiantly until the cyborg removed her weapon arm with his blade. Dropping to her knees and letting out a scream, Chatak looked up at the Sith as he raised his lightsaber and decapitated her in a sweeping arc.\nA tolerant being, Master Bol Chatak was a calm Jedi who became friends with fellow Jedi Roan Shryne on the battlefields of Murkhana. While a caring master to her Padawan Olee Starstone, Chatak allowed Shryne to tease the girl, lightening the mood on several occasions. Together, both she and Shryne questioned the wisdom of Grand Master Yoda and the involvement the Jedi had in the war.\nBol Chatak was trained in lightsaber combat like all Jedi, wielding a blue bladed weapon crafted by her own hand. Her fighting style was described as swift and considerably more graceful than Darth Vader's early applications of his style. Confronting the Sith on Murkhana, she managed to score a blow on his forearm before Vader's sheer brute strength overwhelmed the Zabrak Jedi, resulting in her death.",
