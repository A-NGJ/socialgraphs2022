 "content": "Captain was a male human slave dealer who served Allehander Pso. He was a slave for a long time after his stepfather sold him. Captain's first master was the cruel Kiretim, and years later, Pso bought him. Sometime before Jyn Erso arrived on the Five Points space station, he became a slave dealer and sold Pso's workers to the Galactic Empire. Erso captured him and his crew and rescued the slaves. He was then killed when one the slaves pushed him and his crew out of an airlock into space.",
