 "content": "Nimondro was a male Hobor who served as the Chief of the Hobor people of Tahlboor around 5.5 BBY. He managed to learn about the sky cannon and how to use it, attempting to use it as leverage for peace talks with the Troobs. He truly wanted peace between the two peoples. Although he understood Basic, he pretended not to so as his diplomatic opponents would be kept off-guard. His daughter was Larka Nimondro.",
