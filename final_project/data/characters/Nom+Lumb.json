 "content": "Nom Lumb was a Sullustan bounty hunter who owned a JumpMaster 5000. At some point, they entered into a fight with a M12-L Kimogila heavy starfighter while in their Jumpmaster 5000 and on the run. In another instance, Lumb piloted a Rogue-class Porax-38 starfighter in space near several terrestrial bodies, and destroyed a TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter. By that time, Lumb was known as the \"Laughing Bandit.\"",
