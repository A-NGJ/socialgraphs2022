 "content": "Darva was a Biituian who lived in a village on her homeworld of Biitu during the early years of the Galactic Empire.\nWhen an Imperial starship arrived, bringing the Great Heep to establish a mining operation, she fled as the Imperials triggered a large storm which uprooted trees and sucked all water from the nearby river. With the construction of the \"moisture eater\", a tower that drained all moisture from the atmosphere, Darva was forced to live through a drought which threatened the lives of all the natives. However, they were eventually saved due to the actions of Mungo Baobab and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2.\nDarva was created by Ben Burtt for the Star Wars Droids TV special The Great Heep, in which she was voiced by Melleny Brown.",
