 "content": "Fett was a human male Mandalorian farmer of Clan Fett who served as the constable Journeyman Protector of Concord Dawn after the exile of his predecessor, Jaster Mereel. He was a descendant of the famed Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders Cassus Fett, as well as the father of Jango and Arla Fett, and by extension, the \"grandfather\" of Boba Fett, Jango's cloned son.\nFett was a farmer by trade and owned a homestead on Concord Dawn. He married and had at least two children, Jango and Arla. In 58 BBY, he hid Mandalore Jaster Mereel and his Supercommandos from the Death Watch, but was killed for it, along with his wife, during the Battle of Concord Dawn. Jango survived the battle and was taken in by Mereel, while Arla was forced to serve the Death Watch, but eventually escaped and was put in a mental institution on Coruscant until 19 BBY.",
