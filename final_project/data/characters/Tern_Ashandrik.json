 "content": "Tern Ashandrik was a male Human bounty hunter and criminal who was active during the Rebellion era.\nAshandrik was tall and muscular, with dark hair and eyes and a well-trimmed goatee. He favored black and crimson-colored clothes or his personalized Smasher Armor. Ashandrik was arrogant and smug, looking down on others who he believed were inferior to him. He operated under the theory that one only got things in life by taking them at gunpoint. He firmly believed that he would surpass Boba Fett in terms of success as a bounty hunter.\nAshandrik operated out of a modified MRX-BR Pacifier called the Arbalest. He carried a BlasTech Industries DL-44 heavy blaster pistol as a sidearm, but favoured a Pulse Rifle in combat.",
