 "content": "A clone trooper served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars and fought in its first military conflict, the First Battle of Geonosis, as part of the first batch of combat-ready clone troopers created on Kamino. He was part of the extraction team that arrived with Jedi Grand Master Yoda at the Petranaki Arena in Rebublic gunships to save the surviving Jedi. During the ensuing battle, he traveled in a gunship with senator Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, but eventually fell from the ship along with Amidala due to the impact of shots fired by a Nantex-class territorial defense starfighter.\nThis clone was one of the many clone troopers created on Kamino based on the DNA of bounty hunter Jango Fett with the purpose of serving the Galactic Republic as a soldier. In 22 BBY, he participated in the First Battle of Geonosis during which he accompanied Yoda and numerous other clones to the Petranaki Arena to rescue the surviving Jedi of the skirmish. As the gunship he was aboard touched down to help create a perimeter around the depleted Jedi, he opened fire on the battle droids along with his fellow troopers. He left the arena shortly afterward aboard the LAAT/i transport with Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nIn the midst of battle, Skywalker and Kenobi noticed Count Dooku and ordered the gunship pilot to follow him. However, his complement of Nantex-class starfighters attacked the transport and the clone trooper and Amidala fell off the ship in the ensuing firefight. After a short time, the trooper regained consciousness and hurried over to the senator to check one her, asking if she was fine. she confirmed this and he suggested that they should return to the forward command center. She refused, telling him to rally as many clones as possible and find a transport. The trooper complied and they flew to Dooku's hangar aboard another LAAT/i, backed up by other clones, just as the count was making his escape. He opened fire on the departing Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop, but the Sith Lord managed to fled the planet. The clone trooper then secured the hangar as Amidala hurried over to the injured Skywalker and Kenobi.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, he stood 1.83 meters tall. He was compassionate as he wanted to make sure Amidala had not been injured and also loyal, following orders without question.\nThis clone trooper wore standard phase I clone trooper armor and brandished a DC-15A blaster rifle",
