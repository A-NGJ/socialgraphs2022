 "content": "Huliasu was a male Nothoiin whose grandfather had been a member of the Noble Court. Several months into the blockade of the Anoat sector, the Galactic Empire suspected Huliasu of being a smuggler, and a team of Purge Troopers was sent to the planet of Anoat in order to kill him. The young Nothoiin, however, was saved by the timely intervention of the Smuggler, a young scoundrel from Burnin Konn who had become the central figure of an anti-Empire coalition.",
