 "content": "Pret Swain was the manager of the Socorro-based Caelli-Merced Syndicate, a manufacturer of illegal and semi-legal technology. Swain's parents, both of whom were University of Alderaan scholars, were killed in the destruction of Alderaan. Swain was visiting his uncles, Vance Caelli and Rondale Merced on Socorro at the time, and they offered him a position at Caelli-Merced. Swain took over the business after his uncles mysteriously disappeared.\nDue to the disappearance of his uncles, Swain became paranoid and lied underground in a fortress under Cjaalysce'I. He was protected by his Wookiee friend and bodyguard, Kuykenda. Swain approached Saadoon-Kauldi and offered to sell him a very cheap bulk cruiser that could be used as a mobile, secure habitat. The ship was named Merkel, a customized Action V transport from Corellian Engineering Corporation adapted to Saadoon-Kauldi's specific needs.",
