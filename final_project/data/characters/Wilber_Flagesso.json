 "content": "Wilber Flagesso was a member of the Cloud City Wing Guard on the world of Bespin. Flagesso held the rank of commander within the Guard. While outwardly loyal to Lando Calrissian, he was actually in league with Sawthawne, and attempted to stage a coup when Calrissian shut down the crime boss. His attempts were foiled, however, and he was arrested after fleeing to the Ugnaught Surface. Flagesso had the picture-perfect good looks of a model on a recruiting poster. He owned a Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud car.",
