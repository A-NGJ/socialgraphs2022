 "content": "Esla was an Elder of the Melodie species and the mother of Aragon. She was the \"Keeper of Legends\" for Sistra Mountain's Melodie community. She was long dead by 22 ABY, when her homeworld of Yavin 8 was visited by Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila, who were accompanying Lyric  and were seeking information on the origins of the Golden Globe. According to her son Aragon, Esla was beautiful, with thick, long black hair, yellow eyes, and pale pink lips.\nBecause of her position, she remembered the history of Yavin 8 which was passed down from generation to generation. In 3997 BBY, the Massassi visited the moon to obtain information on how to free their children from the Golden Globe which had been constructed by the Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun to drain the life energies of its captives and to control the Massassi. Since the Melodies had not been able to help, they left messages engraved in the rocks and caves of the moon so that someone might be able to read them and rescue their children.",
