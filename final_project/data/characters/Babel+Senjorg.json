 "content": "Babel Senjorg was a Bith merchant with ties to smuggling and terrorism. He worked with the Ho'Din terrorist Ort Hoogra-D'En after Ort cured him of a fatal illness. He provided supplies and also aided in the transport of Hoogra-DEn's spore bombs to other planets from his home base on Pallaxides. While delivering one of these spore bombs aboard the YT-1300 light freighter Chalcedony, a Rodian detective accidentally set of spore bomb by accident. Senjorg tried to erase the information from his datapads connecting his to Hoogra-D'En but was killed when the ship was forced to crash on Celanon.",
