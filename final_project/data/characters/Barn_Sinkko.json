 "content": "Lieutenant Barn Sinkko was a male Human recruiter for the Imperial Navy and trainer for the Inquisitorius's starship forces in 1 ABY. He usually resided in Kaadara on Naboo.\nSinkko was present at the Battle of Talus. He left his Imperial headquarters on Naboo to make a brief stop on Talus. Coincidentally, just as he arrived, the Rebel forces were launching a counterattack on Imperial forces. The Imperial forces were forced to retreat after an unsuccessful assault on the Talus Rebel base, and were now being relentlessly retaliated against by the Rebellion. Sinkko's insights and immediate grasp of the situation were impressive. At the first sound of alarm, he immediately jumped into the fray of the battle and began organizing the defenses. Thanks to Sinkko's support, the Imperials put up a strong defense, forcing the Rebels to retreat.",
