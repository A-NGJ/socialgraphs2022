 "content": "Bakken was a male Snivvian, who worked as a Rebel privateer during the Galactic Civil War.\nBakken joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, working as an \"alien cultures consultant\" for Alliance Sector Command in the Zaric sector. However, after he had worked for them for a few years, he decided that he instead wanted to be a privateer. Bakken's superiors tried to dissuade him from pursuing his new career, so they reluctantly let him go. He survived two cruises and returned with some cargo, to make a contribution to the Alliance.",
