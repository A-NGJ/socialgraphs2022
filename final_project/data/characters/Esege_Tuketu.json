During the Black Fleet Crisis, Tuketu piloted a BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter with his gunner Skids, and commanded Red Flight at the Battle of Doornik-319.\nEsege Tuketu would be stricken by the loss of his fellow pilot Jojo, and was overcome with grief when he saw Jojo's name posted on the list of casualties aboard their carrier ship.\nDuring the Battle of ILC-905 Esege Tuketu and Skids were killed in action when they sacrificed their lives to destroy a Yevethan shipyard.",
