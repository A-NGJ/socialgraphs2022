 "content": "Helm Iskraker was a known small-time criminal. A large Nothoiin with rolling layers of gold-colored skin, he traveled the galaxy in his ship, the Erratic Orbit. His reputation was often quite negativeâ€”he was known by other criminals as a bumbler and someone who could not be relied upon to get the job done. Despite this reputation, he flawlessly carried out a job on Cloud City in 1 ABY, where he was hired to steal the security codes for the city's computer core. SecuriCo authorities on the station could never trace the crime back to him.\nJason Fry indicated that fellow Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin author Craig R. Carey intended for Helm Iskraker to be of the Nothoiin species.",
