 "content": "Harlas was a male Human who served the Sith Empire during the Cold War between the Sith and the Galactic Republic. He was stationed on the Sith homeworld of Korriban, where he served the Empire as a vendor, working outside the ruins near the Sith Academy. He sold a series of special items in return for commendations earned on the planet. Harlas had dark colored skin, a bald head, and brown eyes. Whilst at his stall, he wore a gray Imperial uniform.\nHarlas first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game he acted as a speciality items vendor on Korriban, the starting world for players of the Sith Warrior and Sith Inquisitor classes. His position was also marked on a map along with other vendors in Prima's guide to the Old Republic.\nHarlas was removed from the game in update 6.2 of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught. He was later brought back to the game in update 7.1 of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Legacy of the Sith.",
