 "content": "Captain Gideon was a Devaronian pirate and leader of the Suwanee Pirates during the Galactic Civil War.\nCaptain Gideon and his crew operated in and around Hutt Space preying on unsuspecting ships by pretending their ship, the Fereallis, was damaged. Sending out a distress call, the pirates would wait for their \"rescuers\" to find their TL-1200 transport which would appear to be damaged and venting atmosphere. Once the victims had boarded the Fereallis to render aid, the pirates would ambush them and confiscate whatever valuables they wished.\nGideon was a typical Devaronian with white horns, red skin and a rakish grin. This, combined with his heavy blaster pistol and vibrosword, only augmented his ominous appearance and made him a formidable adversary. However, Gideon was not entirely vicious in his conduct. If they did not resist his crew stealing their cargo and valuables, he would allow his victims to take their ship and depart unharmed.",
