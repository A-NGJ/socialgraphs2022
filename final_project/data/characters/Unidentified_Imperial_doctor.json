 "content": "During the Imperial Era, a human male doctor served the Galactic Empire onboard the Death Star. The doctor served the Sith Lord Darth Vader as his personal medical caretaker. The doctor was also the supervisor of a nurse who became obsessed and psychotically in love with the Dark Lord of the Sith. After the doctor discovered that the nurse stole Vader's cape and had a container of Vader's pieces of armor and vials of blood, the doctor sought to report it immediately. The nurse, however, escaped and found herself in Vader's hibernation chamber. After confessing her love to him, Vader ruthlessly murdered her and called the bridge to send someone to clean up the body.\nThe doctor wore an Imperial scientist officer's uniform in green. He wore a pale green surgical gown over his uniform whilst operating on Darth Vader.",
