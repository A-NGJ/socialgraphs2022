 "content": "Loddu was a male Hutt who was a low-ranking member of the Hutt Cartel during its conquest of the planet Makeb in 3638 BBY. Unsatisfied with his share of the Makeb mining profits, Loddu took over the asteroid later known as Mek-Sha, but his eagerness to excavate its rich mineral deposits led to his death in a mining explosion.\nA male Hutt, Loddu was a low-ranking member of the Hutt Cartel in 3638 BBY, when the Cartel annexed the planet Makeb, and he was tasked with identifying competitors to the Cartel's isotope-5 mining operations. Loddu discovered a team of geologists who had found rich mineral deposits on an asteroid, and—unsatisfied with his small share of the profits on Makeb—sent mercenaries to capture the geologists and the asteroid, later known as Mek-Sha.\nOver the next few months, Loddu transported slaves and bodyguards to the asteroid and turned it into a mining station; however, production was slow, leading Loddu to demand—against his advisors' recommendations—that explosives be used to clear areas of the asteroid. The resultant explosion destroyed most of the asteroid, killing Loddu and many of his mercenaries and slaves. In the aftermath, Loddu's sibling, Prava, was forced to take ownership of the station, but found that the explosion had uncovered the mineral deposits that Loddu had been seeking.\nLoddu was mentioned in \"The Hutts Discover Mek-Sha,\" a Codex entry in Onslaught, the 2019 Digital Expansion for the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
