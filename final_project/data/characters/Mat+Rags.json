 "content": "Mat Rags was a human male who worked as a podracer mechanic on the planet Tatooine. In 32 BBY, he was present in the Grand Arena of the Mos Espa spaceport during the Boonta Eve Classic race. Prior to the start of the race, Rags worked on the pod of a Vulptereen 327 while its owner, racer Dud Bolt, sat in the cockpit. Rags and the other mechanics rushed off the grid once the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure signalled the start of the race, which was ultimately won by the enslaved human Anakin Skywalker. During the race, Rags wore a blue worksuit with a black utility tool vest, black gloves, brown boots, and pointed brown cowl with a pair of goggles. He had blue eyes and light skin.\nMat Rags appeared in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. In the new Star Wars canon, the character was first identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used in the 1999 video game adaptation of The Phantom Menace. There are multiple characters in the film wearing the same outfit as Rags who appear in a number of shots throughout the scenes in Mos Espa; however, it is only possible to distinguish Rags in one shot based on the colors visible on his utility tool vest.",
