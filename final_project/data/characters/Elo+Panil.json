 "content": "Elo Panil was a male Kaminoan scientist that headed a project funded by the Galactic Empire to create an amphibious super-weapon. During Red Squadron's—an Alliance to Restore the Republic starfighter squadron—mission to Kamino, which was sometime around the first few months after the Battle of Yavin, Panil was discovered to be the only staff-member still present in the research station. According to Panil, the rest of the research team either fled the station or fell victim to the success of the project. Panil was presumed dead after the research station collapsed on top of him during an Imperial bombardment.",
