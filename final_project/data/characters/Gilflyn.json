 "content": "Gilflyn was a male Human who became a corrupt and psychotic Dark Jedi who lived on Corellia at the time of the founding of the New Republic.\nHaving concluded that the light side of the Force had tipped the balance by growing too much stronger than the dark side, he saw it as his duty to hunt and destroy the heroes and Jedi of the galaxy, preferably when they were young and still inexperienced. Trusting in his power of foresight, he lurked about Treasure Ship Row and other likely places, looking to strike down and destroy the next Luke Skywalker or Han Solo before they gained prominence. He owned a YZ-775 freighter named the Mutilator.\nDescribed as \"in his late twenties\" shortly after the establishment of the New Republic, it is impossible that Gilflyn existed at the time of the Great Jedi Purge. He may have been self-taught, without a master.",
