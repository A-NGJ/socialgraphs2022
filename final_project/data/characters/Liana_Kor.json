 "content": "Liana Kor, known as \"Iron\" Liana, was a Twi'lek female smuggler captain operating on Tatooine and Nar Shaddaa during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe smuggler, pirate, and captain known as \"Iron Liana\" operated on Nar Shaddaa and Tatooine, often targeting arms shipments during the Galactic Civil War. These strikes led to her becoming entangled in the conflict between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, and with no love for either side, Kor attempted to play both sides for her own benefit. Although this tactic did not earn her much respect, her smuggling associates described her as stubborn and mean, and \"Iron\" Liana became known as an individual not to be trifled with, as she lived up to her nickname.",
