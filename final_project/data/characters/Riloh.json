 "content": "Riloh was a Human male bounty hunter who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. He had a cousin who worked for Black Sun.\nIn 3643 BBY, he along with Egara and Scorch worked for Rogun Matt'rik. The trio were hired to search for Skavak and Ace for stealing weapons. However, they never knew that Ace was the traitor and that the smuggler was searching for Skavak as well. The trio found the smuggler in the Dealer's Den cantina on Coruscant, but were convinced to back down and leave.",
