 "content": "Battz was a male human forger from Argovia that often offered his services, no questions asked. He occasionally did work for the Rebel Alliance. While a skilled forger, he was less skilled at his gambling habit, and often found himself in debt. On one particular occasion he borrowed money from loan-sharks to cover his debts, but upon failure to pay found himself in trouble with their enforcers. During the Blockade of the Endocray sector, Battz gave to an Alliance strike team a hacked ID card to access the Imperial Sensor Net Complex of Argovia and destroy it.",
