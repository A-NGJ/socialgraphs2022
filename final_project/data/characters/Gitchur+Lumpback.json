 "content": "Gitchur Lumpback was a Human Meatlump who lived on the planet Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin, Lumpback operated out of the Meatlump Hideout in Coronet City. Lumpback dealt with customer complaints concerning the hideout's kissing booth. It was not uncommon for the Meatlump droolers, after kissing a customer, to transmit a viral infection called Meatlump Mono. Spacers who got this infection could go to the Meatlump complaint department, staffed by Lumpback, to demand a refund of their Meatlump Lump. However, Lumpback would put customers through a bureaucratic process, all the while cowering behind a wooden box, and using a retooled B2 super battle droid as a customer service intermediary.\nGitchur Lumpback was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Gitchur Lumpback was added to the game as part of the \"Meatlumps Theme Park\", introduced with \"Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King\", released on June 19, 2008.\nDuring each server reset, Lumpback's gender and appearance was randomized, but Lumpback consistently appeared as a Human.\nThe name, Gitchur Lumpback, appears to be a play on the phrase, \"get your lump back,\" as Lumpback's primary function was to refund players their Meatlump Lump should they have been unfortunate enough to contract Meatlump mono.",
