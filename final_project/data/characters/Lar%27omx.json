 "content": "Lar'omx was a Trandoshan male who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. At some point, Lar'omx betrayed and humiliated his fellow Trandoshan clansman Tray'Essek. In accordance with traditional Trandoshan beliefs, Tray'Essek's jagannath points were zeroed out, leaving him outcast from Trandoshan society and without a place in the afterlife, and he vowed to have revenge against Lar'omx. Having forsaken Trandoshan traditions, Lar'omx later fell in with the criminal organization Black Sun, operating on the planet Coruscant under the Falleen underboss Verannis.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Tray'Essek and a group of operatives loyal to the Pyke Syndicate stole some encrypted date from Black Sun regarding the Nikto bounty hunter Kaa'to Leeachos. Verannis, Lar'omx and several Black Sun enforcers subsequently encountered the Pyke operatives in the gambling establishment the Spyder on Coruscant, and the operatives attempted to convince the underboss that it was in Black Sun's interests the help them to hunt down Leeachos.\nVerannis was unconvinced by the agents' argument and he set Lar'omx and two other Black Sun enforcers against them. Tray'Essek and Pyke Syndicate operatives then engaged Lar'omx and his comrades in a brief fight, and the Pyke agents ultimately defeated them.",
