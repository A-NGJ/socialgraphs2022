 "content": "Bek was a Mon Calamari male who held the rank of lieutenant in the Resistance, serving as a Communications Officer. Bek was placed in charge of a group of Resistance recruits — from a base inside ancient ruins on Batuu — that took off in an Intersystem Transport Ship piloted by Nien Nunb intending to travel to General Leia Organa's secret location. Instead the ship was captured by a First Order Resurgent-class Star Destroyer commanded by Kylo Ren and Armitage Hux. Escort fighters led by Poe Dameron were forced to go for help.\nThe group avoided interrogation thanks to help from Resistance operative Finn, and fled through the ship in a First Order Fleet Transport vehicle. The Resistance attack that followed helped the recruits evade Ren and many stormtroopers, and make their way to escape pods. As the battle continued Bek and the recruits left the ship and returned to Batuu below.\nBek is a character created for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, an attraction for the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park. He appears both on a video screen and as an audio-animatronic character inside the Resistance Intersystem Transport Ship with guests. Bek was first mentioned and seen in information and videos released to the media by Disney shortly before the ride's opening. Bek is voiced by James Arnold Taylor. He is also featured in Lego's Set 75293: Resistance I-TS Transport.",
