 "content": "Devir became the empress of the Krytollak people circa 20 BBY. As the Krytollaks had a rigid social and political structure, and strongly believed that monarchs were destined to rule, she and her people welcomed the Galactic Empire when they first made contact. She quickly recognized Palpatine as her lord and master, and the rightful ruler of the galaxy.\nImperial advisors helped her rule the Krytollak homeworld of Thandruss, giving her people access to modern technology and offworld trade for the first time in their history. Some Krytollaks complained about the high taxes and tribute demanded by the Imperial government, but they always blamed their problems on the Emperor's underlings rather than Palpatine himself.",
