 "content": "Imperial was a fathier female that mated with Virtuous Velocity, and gave birth to the fathier named Shifting Sands in 29 ABY as a result.\nBy around 34 ABY, Shifting Sands had become a racing fathier on the planet Cantonica. Imperial was listed as the fathier's dam on race programs, including one collected by the Resistance mechanic Rose Tico and added to her diary.\nImperial was first mentioned in the 2018 replica journal The Last Jedi: Rose Tico: Resistance Fighter, which was written by Jason Fry.",
