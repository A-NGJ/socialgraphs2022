 "content": "Jobany Cyrs, a descendant of Kirr Cyrs, was a native of Socorro, and was contracted by Alliance member Idris Ro to scout the planet's suitability as a base of operations. A freelance scout by trade, Jobany was sympathetic to the Alliance's cause during the Galactic Civil War, and helped them scout many bases. However, his ancestry gave him a deep sense of nostalgia, and his scouting reports often read like travelogues. He traveled the galaxy in the modified Pathfinder-class scout ship Outward Bound.",
