During the Galactic Civil War he became a pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and brought them the engines for a new model of Imperial TIE/IN interceptor, which he also helped integrate into the Alliances flight simulations. Despite rumors within the Alliance that his father was a peer of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, he performed with enough skill and was deemed trustworthy enough to be selected by Leia Organa to be part of a team to uncover a mole within the alliance. The team worked entirely off the books, with only Mon Mothma knowing of their existence outside of the team's members. As well as discovering the mole they were also tasked with finding a suitable planet on which the alliance could set up a new base.\nFalback Kord first appeared in first appeared in the Star Wars  2 of the comic book series titled simply Star Wars published by Dark Horse Comics.
