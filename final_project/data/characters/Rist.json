 "content": "Rist was a male Human crime lord in the Exchange crime syndicate who provided a number of illicit services to members of the nobility of the planet Alderaan well before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. After years of dealing with the Alderaanians, the crime lord was granted his own lands on Alderaan, and his family was legitimized as House Rist, a minor member of the Great Houses of Alderaan. In the decades that followed, Rist's descendants continued to be employed as assassins and criminals by the other houses.\nHouse Rist's progenitor was first mentioned in the Codex entry for his house in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
