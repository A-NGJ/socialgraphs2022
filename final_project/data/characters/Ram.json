 "content": "Ram was the nickname of a clone commando who served in Bravo Squad. Cloned from the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett, Ram was born on the planet Kamino and trained to become a clone commando in the Grand Army of the Republic's Special Operations Brigade by the Mandalorian sergeant Kal Skirata. In 22 BBY, he served at the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Battle of Geonosis, and survived the battle while the rest of his squad was killed.\nFive days later, Ram was redeployed to the Republic capital world Coruscant, where the six Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos had barricaded themselves in the barracks of Arca Company. Ram and four squads of Republic commandos took part in a stand-off before Ram's training sergeant, Kal Skirata, was able to solve the situation peacefully. Like his clone imprint, Ram stood 1.83 meters tall. In combat, he used the standard Katarn-class armor issued to clone commandos, but with customized colors.\nRam appeared in the 2006 novel Republic Commando: Triple Zero, written by Karen Traviss.",
