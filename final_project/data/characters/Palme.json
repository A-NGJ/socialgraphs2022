 "content": "Lieutenant Palme was an Imperial officer loyal to Moff Kentor Sarne.\nPalme was assigned to Shintel several months before the fall of Kal'Shebbol. He earned Colonel Heget's trust in that time. When Sarne enacted his plan to strand the personnel of the base and trap the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar, he activated Palme.\nPalme commanded four men whose primary mission was to ensure the base stayed isolated. Under Palme's direction, they sabotaged at least one attempt to repair the hyperdrive on one of the cargo shuttles.\nWhen the FarStar arrived, Palme offered them a back-up copy of Sarne's navigational data. The data was false, however, but it was authentically encoded by Sarne himself. The information would point to a vast array of Imperial military bases that didn't actually exist, as well as two sites named D.Star Emperor's Revenge Site One and D.Star Emperor's Revenge Site Two.\nThe true nature of the data was to upload a computer program into the FarStar's engines. When the FarStar next attempted to jump to hyperspace, the program would trigger an overload in the engines that would disable the ship.\nDespite have a slight paunch, Palme was an effective combatant.",
