 "content": "Anniya was a female Zabrak merchant who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, she resided aboard Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above the planet Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. There, she was working as a junk dealer, buying droid parts, old weapons and various other things from spacers that passed by. She was one of the two junk dealers working on Tansarii Point Station, along with Eocade, and she could frequently be found on the main level of the station.\nAnniya appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Anniya was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. In the game, he was a junk dealer that players could sell loot and other items they no longer needed to her.\nWhen Tansarii Point Station and its inhabitants was first introduced into the game, Anniya was depicted under a generic spawn template that included at least one known Human female depiction. Her appearance was later permanently changed to that of a female Zabrak.",
