 "content": "Yudiah Dee was a Twi'lek male who ruled the Ryloth colony planet Aaloth as Keeper and a member of the world's lead family during the High Republic Era. Yudiah was the father of Inun, Haleena, and Lourna Dee.\nAt some point, Lourna Dee, along with her boyfriend Bala Waleen, conspired to depose her father as the world's Keeper, and the family's palace was stormed by a mob of starving citizens. Lourna was betrayed by Waleen and sold into slavery, and the rest of her family was executed, including her father, Yudiah.\nYudiah Dee appeared in flashbacks in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott and performed by a full voice cast. Yudiah was voiced by Neil Hellegers in that audio production.",
