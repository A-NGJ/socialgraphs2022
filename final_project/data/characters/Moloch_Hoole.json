 "content": "Moloch Hoole was a male Shi'ido, a species from planet Lao-mon. He married the Human female Beryl, an aunt to the Alderaanian children Tash and Zak Arranda. His brother Mammon Hoole became an acclaimed scientist during the reign of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine.\nMammon Hoole's brother was first mentioned in 1997, in John Whitman's novel Galaxy of Fear: Eaten Alive. However, he was not identified as \"Moloch\" until 2009, when Adrick Tolliver wrote Death in the Slave Pits of Lorrd, a piece of short fiction that appeared on StarWars.com.\nTolliver thought it was odd Hoole's brother went unnamed while his wife was clearly identified as Beryl, so he came up with \"Moloch\"â€”the name of a demon from John Milton's Paradise Lost. Variants of \"Belial\" and \"Mammon,\" also used as demons by Milton, had previously been used as Shi'ido names.",
