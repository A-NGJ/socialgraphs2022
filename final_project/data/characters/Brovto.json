 "content": "Brovto was a Human who lived on Tatooine during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A fair-skinned Human male with black hair and eyes, Brovto usually wore an assortment of medium armor over his clothes. He brushed his long hair back. A fluent speaker of Basic, Brovto had a shop in the Anchorhead market where he sold weapon modifications.\nBrovto appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Mods Vendor for Republic players on Tatooine. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, he was removed from the game along with the rest of the Mods Vendors.",
