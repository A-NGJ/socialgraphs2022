 "content": "Grand Moff Dureya was a high-ranking Regional Governor of the Galactic Empire.\nHis regular displays of irritable behavior were noted by subordinates like Lieutenant Davith Sconn, and most notoriously demonstrated when Gra Ploven, a world in his priority sector, failed to meet its assessed contributions to the Imperial war effort. Dureya ordered the Star Destroyer Forger to punish the native Ploven by firing into the planet's oceans, creating boiling clouds which killed two hundred thousand of the fish-like natives in three coastal cities.\nWhile the Empire did respond to this atrocity with judicial proceedings, it was Lieutenant Sconn, first officer aboard the Forger, who was punished, rather than the Grand Moff who had given the order.",
