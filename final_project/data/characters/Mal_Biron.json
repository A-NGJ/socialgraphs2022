 "content": "Mal Biron was a Shistavanen smuggler and bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War.\nBron was a former Galactic Republic scout who was forced from his job with the rise of the Galactic Empire and their Humanocentrism policies. He subsequently joined Black Sun as a smuggler and represented Sprax as an unofficial Uvena system representative.\nHis skills as a pilot and smuggler were high, having polished them during several perilous jobs during a series of Hutt gang wars on Nar Shaddaa. In 3 ABY he organized a dangerous race near the Novolek Beacon to evaluate the skills of several potential employees for Sprax.\nMal traveled the galaxy in a modified CEC Barloz-class freighter called Eyeshine.\nMal was a middle-aged Shistavanen, with graying fur, a missing left ear and chipped teeth. He dressed in khakis resembling the field uniforms of the Republic's scout service.",
