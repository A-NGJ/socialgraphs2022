 "content": "This clone trooper was a sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, he served under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker in a battle against enemy artillery on a planet and managed to establish contact with Senator Padmé Amidala, who had recently captured Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray on the planet Rodia.\nDuring the Clone Wars, this clone trooper held the rank of sergeant in the Grand Army of the Republic, and in 22 BBY, he participated in a battle on a planet. At that battle, the Galactic Republic forces—under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker; his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano; and Captain CT-7567—employed AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons against enemy artillery.\nAfter the Republic troops received news of a coup on the planet Rodia, the sergeant was able to establish contact with Senator Padmé Amidala on the planet. Conversing with Amidala through a hololink, Skywalker discovered that she had captured Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who was to be transferred to the galactic capital of Coruscant to stand trial for war crimes.\nSuddenly, the transmission was interrupted, and Skywalker asked the sergeant to reestablish the contact. The clone, however, could not do so because of interference from enemy artillery. Worried for Amidala's safety, Skywalker then sent Tano to help oversee the transfer of Gunray.\nLike all clone troopers, the sergeant had the height of 1.83 meters.\nThis clone sergeant's first, and only, appearance in the Star Wars Legends continuity was in The Clone Wars: Transfer, an issue of the weekly The Clone Wars web comic series written by Pablo Hidalgo and illustrated by Katie Cook.",
