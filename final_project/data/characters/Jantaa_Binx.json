 "content": "Jantaa Binx was a female dancer who was the only known Human practitioner of the Floubette dance, an aesthetically pleasing, idealized form of the Floubettean mating ritual. Traditionally performed by avian species, a Human performance was considered to be shocking and vulgar. Binx was booked to perform at the Marqua Spas Grand Ball, and shocked the attended guests before being escorted away. Tarin DeHallo, the assistant manager of the Marqua Spas, had no clue Binx was Human when he hired her, as he had never heard of a Human performing the dance.",
