 "content": "Es'Loma was a Tarasin female member of the Wyrd, a coven of Force witches that operated on the world Cularin during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Around 31 BBY, Es'Loma ventured to the planet Coruscant and assisted the Believers cult in stealing a Mandalorian iron box that the cultists thought contained a powerful Sith artifact. She accompanied the Believers back to their secret base in the Coruscant undercity and was attacked and defeated there by Jedi-allied agents sent to recover the stolen box.\nEs'Loma was a Force-sensitive Tarasin female who was a member of the Wyrd, a coven of dark side-wielding Force witches active on the planet Cularin during the latter years of the Galactic Republic. Around 31 BBY, the Pulas, a powerful and ancient Sith artifact, was discovered on the planet Almas by a team of Jedi researchers. The Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult that operated in the Cularin system, sought steal the artifact and Es'loma mastermined a scheme to help the cultists seize the relic from the Jedi Order.\nTo prevent the Pulas from falling into the clutches of the Believers, the Jedi arranged for the artifact to be transported to the galactic capital world of Coruscant for safekeeping. The Jedi assembled a small fleet to convey the artifact; each starship in the fleet was to carry a Mandalorian iron box to Coruscant, of which one box contained the Pulas and the remainder were decoys. Es'Loma enlisted with the crew of a vessel in the armada that the Believers suspected was carrying the Pulas, joining the Wookiee Wojarra and the Human Force Adepts San Herrera and Nia Reston aboard the ship. The group collected their assigned box from the Almas Academy Jedi training institution on Almas and departed for Coruscant. Es'Loma planned to help the Believers steal the relic once the ship arrived on Coruscant and she kept her true intentions and her affiliation with the Wyrd secret from the rest of the crew. In truth, the Mandalorian iron box aboard the ship was one of the decoys and contained not the Pulas but a fragment of the dark side-imbued city Conkesta.\nWhen the Jedi fleet reached Coruscant, Es'Loma's ship docked on a landing platform and she and the rest of the crew were greeted by the Bothan Jedi Knight Nysis Belzara, who had come to escort them to a safe house. To cause a diversion, as part of a pre-arranged plan Es'Loma deliberately fell off edge of the platform and was caught by a speeder waiting below. While Belzara and Es'Loma's fellow crew members were distracted by the Tarasin witch's feigned plight, a team of Believer thugs assaulted the landing platform and stole the Mandalorian iron box.\nAfterward, the Believers retreated back to their secret base in the Coruscant undercity with their prize. Es'Loma joined the cultists at the hideout and went to sleep in an alcove near the entrance to the facility.\nA group of Jedi-affiliated agents arrived at the Believer base in hot pursuit of the stolen box. Es'Loma awoke and attacked the Jedi agents, using the Force to conceal her presence while she struck at them. However, she and the Believers were defeated; the Mandalorian iron box was recovered by agents and subsequently escorted to the Jedi Temple, the headquarters of the Jedi Order.\nEs'Loma was an unpleasant individual and was adept at deception, as was demonstrated by the plan that she devised to steal the Pulas whereby she infiltrated the crew of the vessel suspected of transporting the relic. In combat situations, she had a distaste for partaking in fights where her opponents were significantly outmatched. When traveling with Herrera, Reston and Wojarra to Coruscant, Es'Loma gave the impression that she was excited to see the city-covered world.\nEs'Loma was experienced in the use of the Force to sense things, affect the minds of others, move objects. She was also familiar with the powers Drain Knowledge, Hatred, See Force and Summon Storm. In addition, Es'Loma was also a formidable fighter and a skilled climber.\nDuring her attempted theft of the Pulas, Es'Loma carried a hold-out blaster pistol and dagger and she wore street clothes.\nEs'Loma appeared in Coruscani Dawn a roleplaying adventure by Morrie Mullins that was released in 2002 as part of RPGA's Living Force campaign.\nIn Coruscani Dawn, the players role-play as the Jedi-allied agents sent to recover the stolen Mandalorian iron box. The actions and decisions of the players affect the outcomes of their encounter with Es'Loma and the Believers at the secret undercity base. If the player characters apprehend a Believer guard posted to watch the entrance to the secret undercity base, Es'Loma is asleep and off-guard when the players arrive at the hideout. If the players fail to apprehend the guard, Es'Loma receives advance warning that the players are coming and sets an ambush by climbing on the ceiling and leaping down onto the player characters when they enter the base. If the player characters are significantly outmatched by Es'Loma and the Believers, the Tarasin witch crawls onto the ceiling and leaves the hideout in disgust at the poor odds. It is also possible for Es'Loma to be incapacitated or killed during the fight. If Es'Loma is immobilized, the Believers thugs start to flee the base.",
