 "content": "Omo Bouri was a male Wol Cabasshite Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. During his tenure in the Order, Bouri sat on the Jedi High Council.\nBouri trained the Iktotchi Saesee Tiin as his Padawan, and would die in 42 BBY. He was given a funeral where Tiin refrained from eulogizing.\nOmo Bouri was a Force-sensitive male Wol Cabasshite trained by the Jedi Order as a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic. Bouri successfully negotiated the Treaty of Trammis in 124 BBY, glorifying him in the records of the Jedi Archives. Once Bouri had attained the rank of Jedi Master, he was asked to sit on the High Council and served in this position some time between 115 and 103 BBY.\nWhile on the High Council, Bouri took the Iktotchi Saesee Tiin as his Padawan. Training Tiin to knighthood, Bouri's Padawan would eventually sit on the High Council himself. In a particular copy of the third edition of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, Jedi Initiate Thame Cerulian made a note regarding Master Bouri, claiming that he was far superior in the sport of smashball than the Wol Cabasshite Jedi.\nBouri died in 42 BBY, remembered by his fellow Jedi for his years of service to the Order. Tiin had a difficult time with Bouri's passing, spending much of the next twenty years attempting to contact the spirit of his departed Master through the Force, but was never successful. Thus preoccupied, Tiin never took a Padawan of his own, and his usefulness on the Council was sometimes questioned prior to the Clone Wars.",
