 "content": "Flingeld was a male Human Jedi Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Flingeld was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Flingeld studied as a Padawan under Jedi Master Quilljayk on the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. When it was time to take his Trials of Knighthood, Flingeld traveled to the ruins of Kaleth to meditate near a large meditation crystal. His master had tasked him with moving a large boulder through his meditations, but Flingeld grew frustrated with his inability to complete the task and asked another Padawan to do the trial instead. Master Quilljayk was displeased with his student's failure and did not allow him to graduate to the rank of Jedi Knight. Having failed the trials, Flingeld was assigned to the Archives where he would serve the Order as a clerk. Flingeld blamed the other Padawan for ruining his chances of becoming a Jedi, but Quilljayk stated he was never meant to accomplish a feat meant for Masters, but to learn enlightenment and perseverance\nFlingeld is a non-player character in the Star Wars: The Old Republic video game in the Tython mission, \"Commune With the Light\", which is exclusive to Jedi Knights and Jedi Consulars.\nThe player have two dialogue choices with Flingeld:",
