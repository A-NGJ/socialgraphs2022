 "content": "Wade Resselian was a male human dissident who was part of an underground movement known as The Path that helped smuggle Jedi hunted by the Galactic Empire to safety. He piloted a T-47 airspeeder during a rescue mission to the Fortress Inquisitorius on Nur, where he was killed by the Third Sister. His sacrifice, however, gave his allies enough time to escape the base and return to their headquarters on Jabiim.\nWade Resselian joined the Path sometime during the rise of the Galactic Empire. He helped the network rescue Jedi who survived Order 66 and smuggle them to safety. Wade later joined a rescue mission led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Tala Durith to rescue young princess Leia Organa from the Fortress Inquisitorius on the moon Nur. Wade and Sully Stark arrived in T-47 airspeeders to rescue Kenobi, Durith, and Organa, then distracted the Third Sister. However, Reva threw an explosive using the Force at his airspeeder which caused it to explode, killing him.\nWade Resselian was portrayed by actor Ryder McLaughlin.",
