 "content": "Qarin was a female Human bounty hunter who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. During the war she was stationed on board the Vaiken Spacedock space station within the Imperial fleet, where she supplied other hunters with equipment in the supplies section of the station. Qarin wore a silver and red set of armor including a helmet while working.\nQarin was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. In the game she serves as an Imperial elite gear vendor within the Imperial fleet. She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. She returned as a Spoils of War mount vendor in Game Update 6.0 on October 22, 2019.",
