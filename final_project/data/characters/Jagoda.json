 "content": "Jagoda was a Human male Prince of R-Duba. At one time, he owned C-3PO, who saved the prince's life from the assassin droid BX-00.\nAround 10 BBY, C-3PO was involved in Jagoda's court of law and immediately discovered a coup planned by the Ambassador of Dorande and Baron Gavern Starlock. The prince was very keen to talk about Threepio's work but after hijacking Jagoda, Threepio was promoted to Royal Advisor. Starlock was arrested and former Royal Advisors were deprived of their position. Jagoda did not meet Kirk Windjammer long ago, who witnessed a Blasters transfer to a Dorande invasion. Under the leadership of Threepio and Windjammer, the fleet of Dorande was raised and then fled. C-3PO and R2-D2 left R-Duba but suggested Kirk Windjammer as the new Royal Advisor. Jagoda was pleased with their offer and immediately decided to reduce the tax on maritime trade.\nJagoda was a had shown to himself to be bright, thoughtful, and noble person, however, strongly he had been influenced by his advisors, including Baron Starlock.",
