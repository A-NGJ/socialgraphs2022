 "content": "Alain was a Human male private in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, fighting for the oppressed inhabitants of the galaxy. The Alliance valued his connections on the Outer Rim Territories, and Alain served as an Alliance Fleet trooper aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV at some point prior to its destruction in 0 BBY. He was his unit's scavenger. Alain was a fair-skinned man with dark hair. During his service aboard the Tantive IV, Alain wore the standard Rebel fleet trooper uniform. Alain was an idealistic Rebel trooper whom the Alliance valued for his Outer Rim connections. He wielded a DH-17 blaster pistol.\nAlain was first mentioned on a card for the 2001 Premiere edition of Decipher, Inc.'s Jedi Knights Trading Card Game.",
