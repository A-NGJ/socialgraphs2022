 "content": "Kabbura  was a Hutt allied the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War. In the Network Access sector of Nar Shaddaa, he and Major Damarus joined forces in order to maintain the integrity of the HoloNet in the sector.\nDuring the Cold War, the Hutt Cartel controlled the Holo-Net Network Access center and allied it with the Sith. However, the Network was hacked and Kabbura and Damarus sent a Sith to investigate who it was and kill him.\nLike several Hutts who had to deal with technology, Juvard Illip Oggurobb as an example, Kabbura wore an eye piece that served as a Computer interface visor that hooked up on the right side of his head and covered his right eye.\nKabbura, like most Hutts, had brown and tan skin and had orange-brown eyes. He also wore a computer interface visor that served him some use while maintaining the integrity of the HoloNet in Nar Shaddaa's Network Access sector.",
