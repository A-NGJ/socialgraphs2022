 "content": "Senna was a Gigoran male from the planet Gigor who was, along with others from his homeworld, enslaved by Zygerrian slavers whose actions were sanctioned by the Galactic Empire. Though he had not committed any crimes, his species was desired for its natural strength, and Senna was sent to the Pyke Syndicate's spice mines on the planet Kessel.\nIn 10 BBY, he was carrying ore sampler hoppers in the mines when a slave revolt broke out in which the slaves were freed and overthrew the syndicate enforcers watching over them.\nSenna had white fur that was permanently stained orange by Kessel's dust and wore a brown harness with a vocoder that translated his Gigoran speak into Galactic Basic Standard.\nSenna first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story and was first named in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. The name Senna was first used for an alien character in John Knoll's early drafts for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and eventually developed into a Gigoran character that was reduced to a far more minor role in the film and renamed Moroff.",
