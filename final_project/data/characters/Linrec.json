 "content": "Governor Linrec controlled a part of Parmel sector during the Galactic Civil War. He operated from his palace on Revkinn V. Linrec fathered a daughter, Cressis Linrec, and he arranged her wedding to Moff Raiss. This infuriated one of Linrec's underlings, governor Dengless Rinn of Kallistas, who planned a coup against Linrec.\nHowever, Cressis was unhappy with the wedding and ran away with a pirate, Jondrell Inx. As Inx operated on Rinn's territory, Linrec offered Rinn a few days to save his daughter, or he would personally go to Kallistas with his troops. Wanting to hide his conspiration, Rinn hired some bounty hunters to find Cressis and Inx.",
