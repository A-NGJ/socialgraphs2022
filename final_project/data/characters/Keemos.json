 "content": "\"Crosshairs\" Keemos was a male Rodian private of the Galactic Republic living during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3643 BBY he was aboard the Thranta-class corvette Brentaal Star during the Attack on the Brentaal Star by the Gage-class transport Black Talon. Keemos was in a boarding party against that vessel, accompanied by Sergeant Boran, Corporal Hattak and S1-M0. They defended their boarding shuttle against a counterattack by an Imperial strike team, but after were all killed.\nPrivate \"Crosshairs\" Keemos appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the \"Black Talon\" flashpoint only if player choose the Light Side option during their conversation with Captain Orzik, keeping him alive.",
