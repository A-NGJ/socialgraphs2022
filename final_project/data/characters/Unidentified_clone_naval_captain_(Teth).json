 "content": "This clone navigation officer served as a Clone Captain in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The captain served aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer that was under the command of Admiral Wullf Yularen during the Battle of Teth.\nThis clone navigation officer was born on the planet Kamino as a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, and was familiar in naval warfare tactics, eventually serving the Republic Navy of the Galactic Republic. During the pan-galactic Clone Wars between the Republic and Separatist Alliance, the clone officer had the rank of Clone Captain and served aboard a Republic Navy Venator-class Star Destroyer helmed by Admiral Wullf Yularen during the Battle of Teth.\nAs a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, this clone navigation officer was a human male who stood at 1.83 meters tall. He had naturally black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.\nThe clone was trained in naval warfare, and as such held the rank of Clone Captain. He was familiar with the computer systems onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer where he served.\nAs a clone naval officer, the captain wore a blue variant of the standard Republic military uniform with a rank insignia plaque denoting his rank.\nThe clone first appeared in the 2008 film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, where he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voiced all other clone troopers in the film and the series that came afterwards.",
