 "content": "Jessk was a male Trandoshan gambler who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Jessk resided some time in Kachirho, on the planet Kashyyyk. During that time, he patronized a cantina in Kachirho where he played sabacc. However, in 1 ABY, Jessk was catch cheating with other customers, including with a friend of the cantina's owner. The owner then decided to take it upon himself to solve the problem. One of his employees, Tien Wallub, placed a bounty on the Trandoshan via Imperial Bounty Officer Stren Colo. Jessk was forced to flee Kashyyyk and he moved to Mos Eisley, on the planet Tatooine. However, he quickly attracted much attention to himself while cheating in the Mos Eisley Cantina. A bounty hunter who was pursuing Jessk from Kashyyyk then discussed with a cheated gambler and thus managed to trace the Trandoshan. The bounty hunter tracked Jessk to the Krayt Cult Cave and finally killed the Trandoshan in the ensuring fight.\nJessk appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jessk was added to the game with the release of the expansion pack Rage of the Wookiees on May 5, 2005.",
