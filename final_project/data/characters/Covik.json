 "content": "Covik was a human male artist who created the sculpture An Empire's Grace, made entirely of beskar. Ronen Tagge of the powerful House of Tagge, who enjoyed collecting artifacts solely to destroy them, acquired the scuplture, along with a painting created by Falber, and brought the two artists to his private penthouse in Canto Bight, where Tagge asked the artists which of their creations was superior. Both Covik and Falber insisted that the other artist's work was better, but Tagge ultimately opted to destroy both, leaving the two artists distraught.",
