 "content": "Oolak Goyl was a Twi'lek male who had something of an obsession for collecting anything and everything, no matter what the cost. He had little interest in school as a child, and left to pursue a career of collection at an early age. After building up a small fortune in funds, Oolak hired several professional treasure thieves to do his work for him, most notably Aach Een.\nOolak was always accompanied by a pair of hired Gamorrean guards, and would spend most of his free time learning everything possible about his collection. Though obsessive-compulsive and slightly insane, he was very thorough in his planning, and was never careless, rash or free with money. He owned a Luxury 3000 space yacht, the One in a Million.",
