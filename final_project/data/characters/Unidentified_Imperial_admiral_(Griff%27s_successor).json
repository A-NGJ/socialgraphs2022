 "content": "A Human male Imperial officer succeeded Admiral Amise Griff as the commander of the Super Star Destroyer Executor shortly after its completion in 0 ABY.\nThe officer served as the admiral of the newly-completed Star Dreadnought Executor during the warship's maiden voyage on an interim basis in the place of Admiral Amise Griff. He reported directly to Darth Vader but was often at odds with the Dark Lord about the role of Admiral Griff in pursuing the Rebels.\nWhile trying to elevate his position, the Admiral would often remind Vader of Griff's failures, hoping to elevate his own status. The admiral eventually met his end when he carelessly voiced his complaints to another crew member in front of Vader's meditation chamber, believing that Vader was too busy meditating to overhear his insolence. However, Vader had overheard the Admiral's complaints, and tired of the Admiral's continuing fault-finding against his chosen servant, he strangled the man to death.",
