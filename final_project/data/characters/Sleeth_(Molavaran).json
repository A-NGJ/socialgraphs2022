 "content": "Sleeth was a Molavaran gangster, whose mother Magon was the reigning crime-lady of the city Malcraan. He often troubled the local moisture farmer Byrom.\nWhen Sleeth arrived at the farm to ask for protection money one time, he was chased away and humiliated by Darca Nyl. Soon Sleeth's mother arrived with the intention of exacting revenge upon Byrom. Sleeth was embarrassed by his mother's treatment of him as little better than a child, but his embarrassment did not last long, as the bandits were run off by a caravan of Molavarans led by Tooth.",
