 "content": "Jenna was a female Human of Corellian heritage. She and her father were part of a group of colonists that settled a planet of the Outer Rim Territories. Her father served as the sheriff of the Corellian settlement, located in the planet's fifteenth sector, until he was killed by order of Bo-Dum the Hutt. Following the sheriff's death, Jenna and the other settlers lived under the rule of Bo-Dum and his partner Rarsk until the smuggler Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca freed them. Following the Hutts' defeat, Jenna and the rest of the colonists boarded Solo's starship, the Millennium Falcon.",
