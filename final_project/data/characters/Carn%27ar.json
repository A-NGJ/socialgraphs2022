 "content": "Carn'ar was an Aqualish female bounty hunter who plied her trade during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe eldest child of an impoverished family, she was subjected to a cruel upbringing, the effects of which she brought to the profession of bounty hunting in order to support her family. Becoming increasingly cruel and uncaring, Carn'ar began to enjoy preying on those who were too weak to protect themselves; her trademark was the use of slugthrowers and other forms of projectile weapons, eschewing blasters. She was known to send a shell casing engraved with the target's name to that being's family as a reminder of a successful hunt.",
