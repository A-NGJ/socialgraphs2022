 "content": "Bendu Fry was a portly Devaronian male criminal wanted dead or alive by the Black Sun criminal syndicate. Boba Fett, a bounty hunter, tracked Fry down in a cantina in the company of two female Twi'leks and told him to surrender. Fry ran away, but Fett was easily able to catch him with a rope shot out from his glove. However, the Devaronian told Fett that there was a Jedi on the planet. Fett followed Fry's tip, allowing him to live, and tracked the \"Jedi\" down only to find out that he was actually the son of a Jedi Knight who had perished during the First Battle of Geonosis. Fett then returned and killed Fry.",
