 "content": "Dahz Thulaka was a Force-sensitive male Twi'lek who started off as a promising doctor but became embroiled in the dark side of the Force. He joined forces with Talandro Starlyte to kidnap and torture visitors to Starlyte Station around 0 BBY. Those that survived his dark experiments were sold into slavery.\nDahz Thulaka's early life was one of hardship as he was a scrawny child and was bullied harshly. When he grew up he enrolled at a renowned medical school when a Jedi fleeing from the Galactic Empire encountered him and recognized sensed Thulaka's Force-sensitivity. The Jedi began training Thulaka in the ways of the Force and Thulaka learned what he could but the dark side called to him, promising him power. Thulaka learned what he could from his master before betraying him to the Empire.\nThulaka traveled the galaxy hoping to instruct himself on the ways of the dark side and began performing dark experiments on innocent people. Sometime before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY he made his way to Starlyte Station and worked with space station owner Talandro Starlyte to kidnap visitors. Thulaka would perform dark and twisted experiments on the captives usually either killing them or turning them into genetic monsters. Talandro meanwhile would impound their ships and equipment for profit. Any who survived Thulaka's experiments were sold as slaves to the Karazak Slavers Cooperative.\nAround 0 BBY the private investigator Denell Kel'Vannon was hired to find someone who had become one of Thulaka's test subjects. Both Thulaka and Talandro tried their best to keep the dark secret of Starlyte Station from being revealed.\nEvil and twisted, Thulaka became a growing stain on the galaxy. He was not always evil but the promise of power was too alluring for a man who had been bullied heavily as a boy. Peace and patience did not come easily to him which also helped speed along his fall to the dark side. He was unhappy that his experiments ended in failure however he believed that with time he would eventually succeed and his experiments would unlock even more power from the dark side. He was a short, scrawny Twi'lek male with red eyes and dark gray mottled skin. His lekku were long and thin.\nDespite being Force-sensitive Thulaka did not have command or mastery over even the most basic force powers. He was a solid combatant and was well trained with his lightsaber and blaster pistol. He was also skilled in medicine, especially on genetic manipulation.\nThulaka preferred to dress in dark colors and favored a black and indigo hooded cloak. He carried a indigo bladed lightsaber, a BlasTech DL-22 blaster pistol and a double-bladed T'kyja knife.\nDahz Thulaka was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997. He was illustrated by Joe Corroney.",
