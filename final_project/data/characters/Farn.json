 "content": "Farn was a Human male soldier who served the Galactic Republic during the Separatist War and Cold War against the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, he was stationed in Fort Garnik. He personally welcomed a promising sergeant, and future legendary Havoc Squad's commander, upon the sergeant's arrival in the Fort.\nAfter the Sergeant returned to the fort, Farn explained that most soldiers in the base were corrupt, and he could only trust the only person inside, revealing that his CO, Lieutenant Virk, was scamming everyone under his command. He also said that one of his squad-mates, who tried to report Lt. Virk was sent on a death assignment the next day, where he died. The Sergeant accepted to help the young private, saying that as a Havoc Squad member, and reported the situation to the higher authorities, alerting them about Virk's ongoing scam and corruption. Virk was court-martialed, and Farn sent the sergeant a letter of thanks.\nIt is also possible that the player doesn't report Virk, and tells him about Farn, who is later sent on another death assignment. It is also possible, that the player duels and kills Virk and his men, resulting in Farn and his squad getting a new squad leader.",
