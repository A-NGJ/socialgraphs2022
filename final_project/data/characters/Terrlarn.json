 "content": "Terrlarn was a male Gotal mercenary active some time before the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War. He was the first notable kill by the Tiss'shar gunslinger Uul-Rha-Shan.\nTerrlarn, a male Gotal, was a mercenary with a reputation as unbeatable. When he attempted to bully his employer on Port Haven and steal a load of Tagge Company blaster cartridges, the Tiss'shar gunslinger Uul-Rha-Shan intervened. Outdrawing the Gotal mercenary, the Tiss'shar shot and killed Terrlarn, leaving his body on the beach.\nIn the aftermath of Terrlarn's death, Uul-Rha-Shan discovered that killing prominent rivals increased the demand for his services. This led him to build his reputation by killing several other gunslingers for a series of apparently trivial reasons: a career path which resulted in a position as bodyguard to Corporate Sector Authority Viceprex Mirkovig Hirken.\nA picture of Terrlarn illustrated the Gotal entry in an updated edition of Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole's reference work, The Essential Guide to Alien Species.\nEd Erdelac, the author of So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars on the official Star Wars Blog, has retroactively identified Terrlarn with the Gotal Mercenary miniature in Star Wars Miniatures: Legacy of the Force, and with the previously unnamed Gotal pictured in an illustration by Chris Trevas in The New Essential Guide to Alien Species.",
