 "content": "Ziril was a female Twi'lek hyperspace explorer living during the Galactic War. Along with her droid 08-RD she was mapping unexplored space near Rishi Maze using Rishi itself as their resupply point in 3637 BBY, when 08-RD was stolen and dismantled by the Nova Blades pirate gang. An individual overheard Ziril calling after 08 and retrieved broken pieces of the droid from the pirates. Ziril was thankful and started reassembling her companion, though she estimated the process would take at least two weeks.\nZiril appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014.",
