 "content": "Kin-Ya Dosun was a Gungan Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Dosun trained the Jedi Padawan Kosa-Yin Hadu, a fellow Gungan. The pair disappeared around 33 BBY while on a mission from the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. Hadu later emerged about two years later as a Dark Jedi, prompting the Jedi Master Seenlu Kir to investigate the nature of the Gungans' mission to discover where Hadu and Dosun had been lost. However, her inquiries were unsuccessful, and she was unable to learn anything new about their disappearance.\nKin-Ya Dosun was mentioned in The Kaluthin Are Always Greener, a role-playing supplement that was written by Adam Burns and released in 2002. It was the first adventure in the Almas, Sweet Almas trilogy of the Living Force campaign.",
