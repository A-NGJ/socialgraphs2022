 "content": "Dosin was a corpulent, bald Imperial engineer in charge of high-energy concepts at the Maw Installation weapons facility. The only hair on his head were eyebrows, which were dark and narrow. His lips were so thick that when he smiled, he could balance a stylus on them. He was killed when the prototype Death Star was sucked into a black hole at the Maw.",
