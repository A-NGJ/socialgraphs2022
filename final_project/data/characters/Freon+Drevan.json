 "content": "Freon Drevan was a male Xexto con artist who ran a bootlegging business on his homeworld of Troiken prior to 32 BBY. After he promoted factory worker Niai Fieso to a position as his right–hands Xexto, the two expanded the business into a smuggling operation. An ambitious Fieso eventually sold Drevan out to authorities before fleeing with all of their credits, and Drevan was jailed. He was a free being by 32 BBY, a year in which he attended the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace on the planet Tatooine and saw Fieso in the stadium's audience. A brawl erupted, and both Xexto were taken to a local jail.\nFreon Drevan was a Xexto male from his species' homeworld of Troiken. Prior to the year 32 BBY, he was a business owner on the planet. Although his operation was licensed, Drevan was in fact a con artist whose factories produced bootleg merchandise related to Gasgano, a famous Xexto Podracer. When Drevan noticed the swindling talents of Niai Fieso, he promoted the young factory drudge to a position as his right–hands Xexto. Working together, the two expanded Drevan's business into a well–known smuggling organization that dealt in various illegal products.\nFieso eventually grew weary of his position as Drevan's inferior and began to siphon credits from spice smuggling operations. He additionally tipped off authorities to Drevan's illegal activities and fled the Troiken system with all of the business's profits. A subsequent raid on the smuggling operation landed Drevan in prison, lost him his business license, and left him a creditless being with a large tax debt.\nBy 32 BBY, Drevan was no longer a prisoner. In that year, he attended the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace in the Mos Espa Grand Arena on the planet Tatooine. Seated in the audience, Drevan followed the progress of the Dug racer Sebulba as the competitor completed the first of the race's three laps. After the young Human Anakin Skywalker began his own second lap, Drevan spotted Fieso, who was working in the arena as a food vendor. Drevan approached his former apprentice from behind and punched him in the face thrice. A full-on skirmish broke out, and both Drevan and Fieso were taken to a local jail.\nFreon Drevan was a white–skinned individual with black eyes who worked as a bootlegger and a smuggler, employing others in his illegal operation. Drevan was impressed by Niai Fieso's friendly demeanor and how it was used to swindle others, but he later attacked him from behind in a crowded arena after Fieso's betrayal cost him both his business and his credits.\nFreon Drevan's first appearance in Star Wars canon was in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, in which he appeared as a background alien visible in the audience during the film's Podracing sequence. He was given a name in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's 2001 Coruscant Limited expansion set, which also established that Drevan had been left bankrupt following the betrayal of a business partner.\nThe vague character biography given by Coruscant Limited was expanded upon by fan Sander de Lange through StarWars.com's \"What's The Story?\" contest, which allowed fans to write and submit entries for the website's Databank. While writing an entry on Niai Fieso—a Xexto food vendor seen in the extended Podracing sequence on The Phantom Menace's DVD release—de Lange chose Drevan over the Xexto bounty hunter Tosinqas while seeking an existing character of Fieso's species to work into his biography.\nBoth Drevan and Fieso were present at the Boonta Eve Podrace, and de Lange accordingly saw story potential in the connection; as Fieso had no existing biography, de Lange retconned him into being Drevan's former business partner. He intentionally left an open-ended conclusion to the two characters' stories in order to allow for future expansion by other authors. De Lange's entry was ultimately accepted and published online in 2007.",
