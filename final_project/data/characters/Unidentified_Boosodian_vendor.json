 "content": "A Boosodian vendor operated an outdoor clothing stand called Chiu Mo Threads on the planet Daiyu. In 9 BBY, the stand was visited by the Jedi-in-hiding Obi-Wan Kenobi and Princess Leia Organa, whom he had been sent to rescue from capture. Kenobi bought a small green cape from the Boosodian, which the merchant acknowledged in an alien language, and Organa then picked up a pair of gloves as well. Despite Kenobi's insistence that the extra item was unnecessary, Organa ignored him and slipped them on, forcing Kenobi to pay for them. The Boosodian received some credits from Kenobi before the Jedi left. The Boosodian had white eyes, gray skin, and wore dark clothing with a hood.\nThe Boosodian vendor appeared in \"Part II,\" the second episode of the live-action series Obi-Wan Kenobi, which aired on May 26, 2022. When director Deborah Chow visited the creature shop, she suggested that the Boosodian's head could belong to someone who would be amazing at stopping shoplifters. A crew member suggested that the character could own a store and would be able to watch everyone, which Chow agreed with.",
