 "content": "Yimug was a Gran male who worked for the Red Key Raiders. In 5 ABY, Yimug participated in the skirmish in Freetown under the leadership of Lorgan Movellan.\nIn 5 ABY, Freetown was attacked and occupied by the Red Key Syndicate led by Lorgan Movellan, who had come to enslave the town's population and exploit Tatooine for its dilarium oil and silicax oxalate. Cobb Vanth was overpowered by the Red Key criminals, who brought him before their master Lorgan. Lorgan taunted Cobb for his failure to protect Freetown and boasted about enslaving the town's population and selling Borgo, a young Hutt, back to the Hutts.\nTo display his power, Lorgan ordered his henchwoman Trayness to beat Malakili. This caused Borgo to let out an ear-piercing shriek which gave the signal for the Tusken Raiders to attack the Red Key forces. The Tusken stormed the two and quickly killed Lorgan's henchmen, including Yimug.",
