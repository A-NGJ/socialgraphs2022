 "content": "Trehla Keelo was a female Human who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nTrehla Keelo resided in Mos Eisley after the Battle of Yavin. During that time, she used to spend a lot of time near the spaceport from where she tried to help spacers and newcomers in Mos Eisley to be more familiar with the city that she considered as a hive of scum and villainy. Thanks to her numerous and varied acquaintances, including Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt, the entertainer Allura and the medic Kazen Harn, she also helped these spacers to find a respectable profession.\nIn 1 ABY, Trehla Keelo started to work with a spacer who just arrived on Tatooinne after escaping an Imperial space station with the help of one of her acquaintances Darex Rath. With the assistance of the spacer, she discovered that Tusken Raiders were gathering near Mos Eisley in order to attack the city. After a skirmish with the Tuskens in Junktown, she dispatched a spacer to travel to Mos Espa to inform the journalist Trace Lyson about the situation. It was later discovered that the crime lord Jabba the Hutt was inciting the Tusken Raiders to attack Mos Eisley in order to pressurize the mayor of Mos Eisley and eventually take control of the city.\nTrehla Keelo was also acquainted with Vourk ver'Zremp, who was working in Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire. Although she despised the Hutt crime lord, she tried to assist anyway individuals forced to work for the Hutt. Vourk ver'Zremp therefore often referred new Jabba henchmen to her. In 1 ABY, she also helped a spacer who arrived on Tatooine with Han Solo from Tansarii Point Station.\nTrehla Keelo was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nTrehla Keelo was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. She provided several introductory quests to help new players who spawned on Tatooine right after the completion of the \"New Player Tutorial\" to chose their \"profession\". However, the beginning of the game was widely revamped upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005, and Trehla Keelo's questline was replaced by one single skippable and very basic beginner quest.",
