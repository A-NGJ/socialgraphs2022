 "content": "Fen Zeil, known by some as the Shadow, was a male Duros gunslinger who lived during the third Galactic War. Fen took over the leadership of the Shadow Syndicate after working with many larger underworld organizations such as the Hutt Cartel, Black Sun and the Exchange.\nAt one point, Fen Zeil was hired by The Shroud's syndicate to assassinate an agent named Asset K-15, who they believed was dangerous due to his desire for credits and power. Expecting a brief encounter, he tracked the target to Kubindi. However, his search was made difficult due to the planet's geography, and he was ambushed and shot in the eye. He caught a glimpse of Asset K-15 as he fled. He shot but missed, the first time he had ever missed. Seeing the escape as an insult to his reputation and status in the underworld, Fen Zeil vowed to hunt him down.",
