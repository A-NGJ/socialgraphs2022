 "content": "Armand Isard was a human male who served in the Galactic Republic prior to and during the Clone Wars, eventually serving as the director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence. When the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire, Isard became part of Emperor Palpatine's inner circle and served as the director of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order.\nIn 14 BBY, when a rebel cell operated by former Imperial Intelligence agent Berch Teller began to cause problems, Isard attended a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of the Imperial Military on the planet Coruscant. During the meeting, Isard attempted to speak but was interrupted by a junior officer who reported a rebel attack on Lucazec. Isard had raven blackâ€“colored hair.\nArmand Isard first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in James Luceno's 2014 novel Tarkin. Luceno stated that he included Isard in Tarkin as he fit into a role that was part of the story Luceno was writing, hence his appearance rather than the invention of a new character.\nIn the Star Wars Legends continuity, Armand Isard first appeared in the short story \"Interlude at Darkknell,\" published in the 1999 anthology book Tales from the New Republic and written by Timothy Zahn and Michael A. Stackpole. He was first pictured in the 25th strip of Reversal of Fortune, a series of webstrips published on Hyperspace between October 2004 and June 2005. The strips were written by Paul Ens and illustrated by Tom Hodges.",
