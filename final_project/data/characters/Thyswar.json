 "content": "Thyswar was a male S'kytri of the Lowland Clans of the planet of Skye. A member of the Supreme Council that governed the planet, he resided in the planet's capital city, the City of the Winged People.\nA S'kytri of the Lowland Clans, Thyswar served as a member of the Supreme Council in 22 BBY. At this time, the crazed Arkanian mutant, Zeta Magnus had brought a pathogen to Skye and unleashed it on her people, declaring himself Magister in the process. When Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his two Padawans, Anakin Skywalker and Halagad Ventor were brought before the Council to discuss the future of the Tyrant which ruled over them, Thyswar voiced his shock and disdain for Patriarch Klarymére's proclamation that the Outland Clans might have a good reason to attack them based on the outdated bylaws that governed S'kytri society. Speaker Nebaél silenced Thyswar and reprimanded him for speaking out of turn and later granted the Patriarch and the Jedi permission to neutralize the self-appointed Magister.",
