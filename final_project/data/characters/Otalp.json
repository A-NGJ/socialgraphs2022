 "content": "Otalp was a male Squidge and the den-brother of Remoh who lived long after the death of Luke Skywalker. His species was being oppressed by the Vindar.\nInspired by a vision from his den-mother, Otalp set out in search of the storyteller with a skeptical Remoh in tow. After a long journey, they found the storyteller, broken down and inactive, in a cave. After they reactivated him, the droid told them a tale of a hero who led the fight against a dark oppressor and brought hope to the galaxy. When Vindar discovered the cave, Otalp told Remoh to hide, and gave his life to protect his brother.\nThe names of Otalp and his brother Remoh are ananyms of Plato and Homer respectively. Both Plato and Homer were figures of ancient Greece.",
