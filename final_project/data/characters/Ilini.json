 "content": "Ilini was a Ubese bounty hunter who was a member of the crew led by Boushh, consisting of fellow Ubese who had been exiled from Uba IV. The bounty hunter Ilini had been exiled after an incident that ended with their lover, Hareck, assisting in hiding the body of Ilini's father.\nIlini appeared in War of the Bounty Hunters – Boushh 1, a one-shot issue of the Star Wars: War of the Bounty Hunters comic book crossover event, which was written by Alyssa Wong with art by David Baldeón. After the release of the issue, Wong shared further details from their script notes via Twitter, including Ilini's non-binary gender and observations about their personality, and later noted that Hareck was Ilini's husband.",
