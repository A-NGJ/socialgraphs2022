 "content": "Purpsh was a male Vagaari who accompanied Vagaari Empire Supreme Commander Estosh, General Bearsh, and another Vagaari, all of which posed as Geroons, during their infiltration of a Chiss mission to the Redoubt in 22 ABY. He installed a recorder in the navigational lines of the Chiss diplomatic vessel Chaf Envoy while Estosh talked with the fake New Republic Ambassador Dean Jinzler, preventing him from learning of Purpsh's actions. After the Vagaari had infiltrated the remains of the Outbound Flight colony starship at the Redoubt and Chiss Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano \"Formbi\" shot the third Vagaari infiltrator, Bearsh revealed the group's true identity. The general also infomed Jinzler that Purpsh wanted to gun everyone present in a conference room, however, he allowed the Chiss and the ambassador to choose if they wanted to die by a wovkil's attack, getting close to several schostri, or by the method Purpsh preferred.",
