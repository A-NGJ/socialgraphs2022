 "content": "Andrithal Robb-Voti was a human female who served as senator for the planet Taris in the Galactic Senate of the New Republic. In 28 ABY, Robb-Voti was on the planet Hosnian Prime while it hosted the Senate, and she was injured during the Napkin Bombing. In 34 ABY, Robb-Voti and several other senators were killed when the First Order used their Starkiller Base to destroy the entire Hosnian system. While on Hosnian Prime, Robb-Voti wore purple robes, the Tarisian color of administration.\nAndrithal Robb-Voti was created to appear in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released on December 18, 2015. She is not visible in the final release of the film, but appeared in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film.\nAndrithal shares part of her surname with the character Kin Robb, who was also a Senator from Taris. However, no connection has been made between the two characters.",
