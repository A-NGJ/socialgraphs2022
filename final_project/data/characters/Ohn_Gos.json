 "content": "Ohn Gos was a male Blarina who worked as a merchant in Blowback Town on the desert planet Jakku around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. He was known for being sympathetic to others, and so after the Blarina scavenger Naka Iit discovered the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron lost in Jakku's desert, he decided to bring him to Gos in the hopes that he would help him get offworld. En route, Dameron helped the scavenger escape from the criminal Strus clan and earned his gratitude, causing Iit to promise that he would intercede with Gos and make sure Dameron got offworld, which the pilot successfully did soon after.\nOhn Gos was first mentioned in the novelization of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was written by Alan Dean Foster and released in conjunction with the movie in 2015.",
