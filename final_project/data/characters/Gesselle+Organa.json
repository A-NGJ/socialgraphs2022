 "content": "Gesselle Organa was a female Alderaanian Human general of the Galactic Republic and a member of the House of Organa during the Cold War.\nDuring the war against the Sith Empire and the House of Thul, Gesselle Organa and her troops were protecting a tremendously powerful force field, which was powered by siphoning power directly from Alderaan's planetary generator. However, a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup modeâ€”cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\nAfter the Sith Warrior sabotaged the planetary generator and killed numerous soldiers, Organa, along with Blenks, Kan'grell, and Prinn confronted the Sith, who was looking for information about Jaesa Willsaam, Organa's former handmaiden. Organa decided to make an offer to the Sith, which was refused. The Sith started to torture Blenks, who was Organa's lover. Refusing to watch him die, Organa revealed that the Jedi Padawan Jaesa Willsaam's parents were still servants at Castle Organa. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Warrior executed Organa and her bodyguards for defying the Empire.",
