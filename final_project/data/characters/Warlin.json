 "content": "Warlin was an Human male from the planet Acherin. He was the only survivor of the group of Eluthans who were rescued from an Imperial prison by the freedom fighter known as Flame, during the early months of the New Order. All of the other Eluthans, including Vira, later died in the civil war that engulfed the planet when the Empire abandoned it. Warlin himself had lost many family members during the fighting, and clung to his one surviving daughter. This presented a problem, because his daughter was married to a Sood.\nWhen Clive Flax arrived on Acherin to learn more about Flame's history, he hoped to meet with Warlin and discuss his rescue. However, just before the meeting could be arranged, Warlin was killed by a group of Eluthans who believed that he was serving as a spy for the Soods.",
