 "content": "Darkon Lakade was a male Cerean engineer who lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Lakade worked for the criminal Organization of the Oblee crime lord Nirama at a weapons storage facility on the asteroid Rothe Gate, situated in the Cularin system asteroid belt.\nCirca 31 BBY, The Cell—a rogue faction of the Organization—sought to oust Nirama from control of the criminal group. Lakade did not join the faction and remained loyal to Nirama, but The Cell planted false evidence that implicated Lakade as being a member of their group, in an attempt to deceive Nirama into dismissing a loyal employee.",
