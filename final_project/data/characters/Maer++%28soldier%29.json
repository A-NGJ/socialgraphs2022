 "content": "Maer was a humanoid male who served as a corporal in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was stationed at the Alliance High Command headquarters of Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth shortly before the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. Maer was a tauntaun handler who developed a unique sign language to communicate with the creatures. He received training in the use of many of Echo Base's heavy weapons, including the Atgar 1.4 FD P-Tower. Following the Rebel Alliance's defeat at Hoth, Maer became well-known as one of Echo Base's tauntaun handlers.\nMaer was an expert on animals as well as Hoth's frozen terrain. During his tenure on Hoth, Maer wore the Rebellion's standard Echo Base cold-weather armor. His suit included headgear, anti-glare goggles, a scarf, padded vest, padded tunic, gloves, and leggings.\nMaer was first mentioned on a card for the Premiere edition of Decipher's 2001 Jedi Knights Trading Card Game.",
