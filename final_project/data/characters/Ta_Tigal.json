 "content": "Ta Tigal was a Zabrak male gambler who lived during the time of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. He was a former lover of Kaliyo Djannis and remained in love with her, even though she swindled him in the past. He wanted to reignite their relationship and sought her out again but his search for her drew her ire as it was drawing unwanted attention onto her. Kaliyo managed to persuade Imperial Intelligence to make him a target.\nCipher Nine and Kaliyo tracked him down to Nar Shaddaa. With Cipher Nine's urging, Kaliyo Djannis killed him.\nIf the agent player chooses a light side option, he/she can persuade Kaliyo to let him live.",
