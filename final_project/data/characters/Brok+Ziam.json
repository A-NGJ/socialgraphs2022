 "content": "Brok Ziam was a Human male who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. He was the Director of Operations of the White Thranta Shipping Company, a front for the illegal activities of Jabba the Hutt's criminal organization.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, members of the White Thranta Shipping under Brok Ziam got involved in questionable medical activities. They performed unethical experiments on sapient races in the bunker bellow the White Thranta Shipping offices, without Jabba the Hutt being aware of it. Ziam's plan was to use the White Thranta Shipping Company to make enough money to eventually break away from Jabba. In 1 ABY, Jabba's employee Reimos Taligg tasked a spacer to slice the computers of the White Thranta bunker, eventually discovering the situation. Reimos then requested the spacer to question Brok Ziam but Ziam refused, forcing the spacer to kill him.\nBrok Ziam was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Brok Ziam was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. In the game, Brok used to have the extended last name, Ziamzun. For some unknown reason, the developers shortened the name Brok Ziamzun to Brok Ziam.",
