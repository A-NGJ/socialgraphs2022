 "content": "Banz was a male Human Jedi Initiate who studied in the Jedi Order's academy during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Banz was brought into the Jedi Order to receive training in the ways of the Force. A member of the Bergruutfa Clan, a clan known for its members intense loyalty, Initiate Banz and his peers were placed under the tutelage of the Abyssin Jedi Master Quarmall. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Bergruutfas' unorthodox Master took the unprecedented move of taking the entire clan as his Padawans.\nMaster Quarmall directed his students aboard a Mon Calamari-crafted cruiser during the war, until the ship was ambushed and boarded by the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous. As their Master lay in a heap, the Berfruutfas were herded aboard Grievous' ship and taken to Gentes for experimentation. Remaining calm, Initiate Banz stayed close with his peer, Allara and worked to keep everyone calm. After staging a breakout, the Initiates and a group of Ugnaught refugees crossed paths with Padawan Codi Ty. He and his master, B'dard Tone were infiltrating the facility in an attempt to assassin Grievous, but the mission had gone awry. Sensing his Master's death, Ty escort the children out of the facility and back to the Coruscant Temple. There, Allara pleaded with the Jedi High Council to allow Ty to stay in the Order, but the august body dismissed him for insubordination.",
