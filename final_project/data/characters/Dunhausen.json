 "content": "Dunhausen was a high-ranking Imperial officer and member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs. He was Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa's most trusted Grand Moff.\nAt a secret conference with the self-proclaimed heir to the Galactic Empire, Trioculus, Dunhausen recommended that a new Imperial city-seat should be established on the planet Tatooine. The recommendation was lacking any strategic value and was more closely tied with his desire to take control of the Mos Eisley spaceport. Trioculus rejected his recommendation.\nDunhausen was predominantly known for two things; his scheming nature, and for always wearing a pair of blaster-shaped earrings.\nHe owned the droid 3B6-RA-7.",
