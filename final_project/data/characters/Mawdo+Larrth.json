 "content": "Mawdo Larrth was the Ithorian owner of Cladtech, a factory on the Inner Rim world of Gilvaanen, which manufactured stormtrooper armor components during the Imperial Era. He colluded with Thetis Quelton to delay the production of stormtrooper armor by organizing strikes among his workers. In response, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the efficiency expert Count Denetrius Vidian visited Gilvaanen to investigate. After Larrth organized an illegal meeting of the managers, he was executed by Vidian, who identified him as the ringleader behind the strikes. The other Ithorian managers were then ordered to meet the Galactic Empire's production targets on pain of death.",
