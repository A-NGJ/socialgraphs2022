 "content": "Faddaff Davenspon was a Deymasollian female who after a life of tinkering and years of interstellar travel, had top-notch technical skills and an innate feel for starship systems. She worked as an outlaw tech-for-hire but would never settle for a routine job and was willing to cut a deal in order to get hold of technology that intrigued her.\nShe had lived on the planet Kijimi for several years before it was occupied by the First Order, and in 35 ABY, she spent time in the bar of the Spice Runners' Den in Kijimi City shortly before it was destroyed by the Final Order.\nFaddaff Davespon was a Deymasollian female, born in around 265 BBY, who survived by working as a outlaw tech-for-hire for the highest bidder. For many winters she lived on the planet Kijimi, and she had been there for several years before it was occupied by the First Order. During the occupation in 35 ABY, she stood with two hooded figures in the bar of the Spice Runners' Den in Kijimi City when the Spice Runner Zorii Bliss led a group of Resistance agents through the room. Not long after the encounter, the First Order evacuated all of their forces from the world before it was destroyed by their allies in the Final Order.\nFaddaff Davenspon was willing to cut a deal and lower her rates to get her hands on technology that intrigued or excited her. This was especially true of starship designs that she had not previously encountered in her long and well traveled life.\nLike all Deymasollian, Davenspon had a keen memory and would never have settled for a routine job. She had yellow skin, black eyes, and a white fur coat that had grown in thicker over her many winters on Kijimi. The Deymasollian's delicate fingers were well scaled for fine technological work.\nAfter a lifetime of tinkering with everything she could get her hands on, Faddaff Davenspon had developed top-notch technical abilities. As a result of years of experience with interstellar travel, she had an innate feel for starship systems that made her particularly good at working on them.\nDavenspon wore a black outfit including boots and gloves and had three grease tanks attached to her chest. She used a pair of gray goggles with yellow lenses.\nFaddaff Davenspon was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was identified simultaneously in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo, and a card in the 2019 Topps Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Series 1 trading card set by The Topps Company, Inc.. Concept art of Davenspon titled \"Wizard 16\" was created for the film by creature concept designer and senior sculptor Louis Wiltshire.",
