 "content": "Prand was a Twi'lek male technician who served the Balmorran resistance during the Cold War against the resurgent Sith Empire. He and his fellow technician Jalba were conned by Tanno Vik, who commandeered their entire security team for personal reasons, leaving their outpost defenseless. Though Jalba and Prand were saved by the timely arrival of Havoc Squad captain, their comrades who followed Vik were much less lucky.",
