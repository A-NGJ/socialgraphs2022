 "content": "Kaddit was a male Rodian bounty hunter who worked for the Galactic Alliance around 43 ABY. He assisted Galactic Alliance Security forces in the initial arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, and was later partnered with fellow hunter Zilaash Kuh to capture the rogue Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who was suffering from a psychotic breakdown. Kaddit opened fire with his blaster on the news speeder in which Horn was riding and disabled the vehicle, but the fugitive Jedi was quickly detained by Skywalker.\nKaddit was a male Rodian bounty hunter who often worked for the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. In 43 ABY, he was hired to assist Galactic Alliance Security forces under the command of Captain Savar during the initial arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker. Skywalker was taken to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse; however, he was released soon after.\nKaddit was later partnered with fellow bounty hunter Zilaash Kuh as a member of Chief of State Natasi Daala's special-missions force to capture the fugitive Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who had gone on a destructive rampage through the galactic capital of Coruscant after suffering a psychological breakdown. During the chase, Kuh and Kaddit flew a black, two-seater racing speeder with engines similar to those of a podracer. When they caught up to Horn—who, by that time had made a deal with a Galaxy 9 News reporter to exchange information in turn for transport in her speeder—Kaddit opened fire on Horn's vehicle with his blaster rifle. The news speeder was damaged, but before they were able to capture Horn, Skywalker caught up to the Jedi and quickly incapacitated him. Kuh and Kaddit attempted to convince Skywalker to hand the fugitive over to Galactic Alliance custody on Daala's orders, but the Grand Master ignored them, and Horn was placed in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center.\nKaddit was often employed by the dominant galactic government of his time, the Galactic Alliance, and was known to work with other bounty hunters on assignments. When working with another hunter, Kaddit was rather passive, preferring to stand by and let his partner take command of the situation. During the hunt for Horn, Kuh piloted their black racing speeder—an airspeeder with arrow-tipped white stripes and engines reminiscent of a podracer's—while Kaddit fired on their quarry. The Rodian was a skilled sniper; he carried an unusually long blaster rifle, complete with a scope.\nKaddit was created by Star Wars author Aaron Allston for Fate of the Jedi: Outcast, the first novel in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series. This novel, released on March 24, 2009, is Kaddit's only appearance to date.",
