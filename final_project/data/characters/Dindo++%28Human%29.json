 "content": "Dindo was a Human male bodyguard who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Dindo traveled to Tatooine when he was hired by Tyresius Lokai to protect him. However, Dindo saw this job very futile since Lokai left him to die on the desert planet. When an unidentified bounty hunter arrived to kill Lokai, Dindo was forced to engage the bounty hunter, but was easily defeated. Dindo immediately gave up the fight and the hunter told everything about Lokai. He begged the hunter to let him go since it was not personal for him to die, but the hunter did not buy his plea, and shot him.",
