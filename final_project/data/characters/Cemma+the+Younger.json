 "content": "Cemma the Younger was a Human gunslinger from a backwater world. Although he had gained a reputation as a deadly quickdraw, in fact he preferred to shoot unsuspecting victims in the back rather than challenge them openly. Cemma had a handsome, youthful face which made him popular with the opposite sex, and which led most humans to believe that he was trustworthy. In fact, Cemma was little more than a ruthless, psychopathic murderer.\nWhile on StarForge Station Cemma responded to a call by Captain Dhas Vedij to join the crew of the Rebel privateer vessel Far Orbit.",
