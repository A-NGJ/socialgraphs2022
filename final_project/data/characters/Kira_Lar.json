 "content": "Kira Lar was a Human female Alderaanian who served as a Rebel Alliance officer at Echo Base around the time of the Battle of Hoth. Shortly before the destruction of Alderaan, she was preparing to join the Imperial Navy. Despite her extensive natural talent in naval strategy, being a woman meant that she would have likely remained a junior officer for her entire career. Upon learning of her homeworld's destruction, she and several other Alderaanians with whom she traveled made the last-minute decision to defect to the Rebel Alliance. She served with distinction at the Battle of Yavin, Hoth and Endor as a military attach√© to General Crix Madine, helping him to coordinate operations.",
