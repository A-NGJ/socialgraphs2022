 "content": "Haisha Su Bnist was a Human female from the Tapani sector who made a living as an information broker and petty thief during the reign of Galactic Empire. Around the time of the Galactic Civil War, when she was eighteen years old, Bnist killed and Imperial stormtrooper while resisting arrest. A \"dead or alive\" bounty for 3,000 credits was subsequently placed on Bnist by the Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations, and she fled off-world, to seek the aid of her underworld contacts and go into hiding. The IOCI suspected that Bnist sought to acquire cybernetic implants in order to enhance her reflexes and the Imperials advised that bounty hunters considering taking on the contract commence their search for Bnist by making inquiries to black market cybernetics surgeons.",
