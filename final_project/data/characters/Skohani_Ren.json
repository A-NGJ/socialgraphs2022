 "content": "Skohani Ren was a Togruta male who had joined the Jedi Order and attained the rank of Jedi Master by the time the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire began. During the war Ren was stationed on the planet Alderaan, where he attempted to help a noble of the Great House of Organa who was being joined to the Killik species. Ren alone was not strong enough to help fight off the joining process, and he enlisted the help of an individual aligned with the Republic to distract the Killiks by attacking their nearby forces. The individual did as requested, and the resultant distraction was enough for Ren to help purge the noble's mind of the Killik influence and stop the joining process.\nSkohani Ren was a Force-sensitive Togruta who had become part of the Jedi Order and been trained in the ways of the Force, reaching the rank of Jedi Master by the time the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire took place. In the year 3643 BBY, Ren was stationed on the planet Alderaan where the Alderaan Civil War was being fought amongst the planet's many noble houses. Whilst in the Apalis Coast region of the planet, he encountered a noble from the Great House of Organa—a house allied with the Republic and the Jedi—at the Republic base named Wardpost Duvaal. The noble was in the process of being joined to the Killik species due to long-term exposure to their pheromones, a process which would make him a drone who served them at the expense of his own feelings and memories. Ren attempted to help the noble fight off the joining process by purging his mind, but could not manage it alone against the many voices of the Killiks that were affecting the noble's mind.\nWhilst Ren was trying to help the noble, he was approached by a Republic-aligned individual whom the Jedi asked to help him. He requested that the individual attack nearby Killiks and Killik egg clusters in an attempt to distract the species hive mind from the noble. It was Ren's hope that with the Killiks distracted, he could more successfully help the noble fight off being joined to the Killiks. The individual agreed and attacked Killik egg clusters and forces located near Wardpost Duvaal in the ruins of the Mensaav Laboratory. As they did so, the noble managed to successfully fight off becoming a joiner with Ren's help and began recovering slowly. When the individual returned to Duvaal Ren, he thanked and rewarded them for their efforts with equipment and 2045.\nSkohani Ren was a male Togruta with primarily red skin and red eyes. When he discovered the imperilled noble on Alderaan, Ren did everything he could to save him, and when he couldn't help alone he refused to leave the man and paid another to aid him.\nWhilst on Alderaan, Ren wore brown Jedi robes and belt where he hung his lightsaber.\nSkohani Ren first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a MMORPG released in 2011 by BioWare. Ren is the start and end point for the optional quest \"From the Brink of Death\" for player characters in the Republic faction and gives different reward items for quest completion dependent on the player's class. This articles assumes that players did complete the quest so as to attain 100% game completion.",
