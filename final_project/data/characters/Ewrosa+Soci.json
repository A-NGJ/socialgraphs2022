 "content": "Ewrosa Soci was a male Twi'lek who operated out of the Yavin 4 Labor Outpost during the Galactic Civil War.\nEwrosa was known to sell Sith and Massassi artifacts to off-world buyers and used the money he made from these sales to smuggle spice in for the miners on Yavin 4. During the Galactic Civil War, Osae Meilea wanted to get Ewrosa on her payroll. To do this, she hired someone to first wipe out all of Soci's grave robbers, and then the smugglers at his smuggler camp destroying both of his sources of profit. After this, the individual went to Soci to inform him of what happened. Once the individual informed him, he agreed to work for Ewrosa, as he was a creditless, broken man.",
