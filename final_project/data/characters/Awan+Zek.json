 "content": "Awan Zek was a male human bounty hunter who lived in the galaxy. Awan was also known to work with two Rodian associates. He tried to settle scores with the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka but Hondo managed to escape with the help of the scavenging family known as the Freemakers. After Hondo tried to steal the Freemakers' ship StarScavenger, the Freemakers handed Hondo back to Awan and his associates.\nAt some point before the Battle of Yavin, Han Solo and Chewbacca owed Awan a Durasteel-transmitter coil. After chasing Han and Chewbacca around the Ring of Kafrene, Awan and his Rodian associates caught and threatened Solo and Chewbacca to give them a new coil. Eventually Solo and Chewbacca were able to find the coil through the help of Han's old friend Pace Freemaker.\nAt some point later following the quest for the Kyber Saber Crystals, Awan was cheated by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka in a game of sabacc. Hondo managed to convince the Freemakers to give him safe passage offworld by offering to help them find a Corellian Defender on the planet Taul. Rowan Freemaker needed to obtain a proton suspension housing from the Defender in order to build a starship called the Arrowhead.\nBefore Hondo could leave with the Freemakers, Awan Zek confronted him for cheating him. Hondo protested his innocence but dropped the cards, proving his guilt. Rowan managed to use his Force powers to hurl a table at Awan and his two Rodian associates. Awan and his associates gave chase but Rowan used the Force to slam the door shut. When Zek chided his associates for letting the Freemakers escape, the orange Rodian recognized Rowan and recalled that the Galactic Empire had placed a bounty on the boy's head. Awan then contacted an Imperial Star Destroyer and informed them that Rowan was heading to planet Taul. The Imperial hunter droid M-OC picked up the message and traveled to Taul.\nThe Freemakers managed to obtain the proton suspension housing using Hondo's information. However, Hondo abandoned them and tried to steal their ship, the StarScavenger. Hondo was eventually tackled by their B1-series battle droid Roger and locked inside a sealed canister. After rescuing the Rebel Alliance Major Bren Derlin, Roger handed Hondo in a box to Awan and his associates. Hondo tried to humor Zek and his associates with a game of sabacc but they ignored his offer.\nAwan Zek was a human male bounty hunter with a pockmarked face. He wanted to settle scores with Hondo Ohnaka for cheating him in a game of sabacc and was known to work with two Rodian associates.\nAwan Zek first appeared in the LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two episode \"The Storms of Taul\", which premiered on August 2, 2017. He appears to be physically based on Cornelius Evazan.",
