 "content": "Knoke was a Rodian bounty hunter who operated at some point during the reign of the Galactic Empire. While on Rodia, the Rodian homeworld, Knoke took on the Nikto Kaa'to Leeachos as a bounty hunting apprentice. Knoke was later killed during the Great Jedi Purge while attempting to capture a rogue Jedi, though Leeachos subsequently finished the job and claimed the contract placed on the Jedi. Knoke left his starship and Leeachos, and the Nikto used his master's equipment to help himself to forge a successful bounty hunting career of his own.",
