 "content": "Liam was a human male child from the planet Hetzal Prime. According to the Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, he was no more than ten or eleven years old. Around 230 BBY, Liam was captured by the Nihil Tempest led by the Quarren Kara Xoo and taken aboard Xoo's ship, the Poisoned Barb, to the planet Dalna. Once they arrived on Dalna, Liam, along with two other captured kids, the Umbaran Petri and the Kage Krylind, were taken by the Nihil pirate Squib to become part of his strike. Eventually, Liam was able to escape from the Nihil and was found by Rwoh and Jedi Master Nyla Quinn, who he told about his experiences. Afterwards he was taken to and left at the Dalna Jedi temple by Honesty Weft and Sha'nai Plouth.",
