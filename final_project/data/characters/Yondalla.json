 "content": "Yondalla was a Zabrak female working for Jabba the Hutt as a lieutenant. She resided in Wayfar, Tatooine, near Jabba's Palace. When one of Jabba's top assassins, S'lee, was arrested by CorSec, she was given the task of finding someone who could break him out of the CR90 corvette en route to Dathomir. Once it docked, S'lee was to be traded to the Imperials for a CorSec officer. It was important to Jabba that S'lee not end up with the Imperials, as he was afraid S'lee would talk.",
