 "content": "Meex was a Human male who was a Rebel Elite Commando. He accompanied Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker to Kiva on a mission to stop Project Starscream.\nMeex trained with Rebel soldiers and quickly climbed the ranks. On a mission to Kiva, he was in charge of baby-sitting Zak Arranda, Tash Arranda, and the baby, Eppon. Mysteriously two men under his command, Tino and Bergan, died and their bodies were nowhere to be seen. He went on but was later killed by Eppon. Eppon touched Meex's skin, which changed to liquid and Eppon drank it and grew on. Eppon was the first soldier in the Army of Terror.",
