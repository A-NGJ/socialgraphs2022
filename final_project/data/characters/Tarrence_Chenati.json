 "content": "Tarrence Chenati was the alias of a spy who infiltrated the Jedi Starfighter Program in order to sabotage it. A former member of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence, though he was reported to have died in 62 BBY, his identity was reactivated in 42 BBY by the Galactic Senate. Although discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl trying to sabotage Clee Rhara's starfighters, the spy assuming Chenati's name escaped, but his mission was ultimately successful, as the Jedi starfighter program was soon shut down. Though 'Chenati' disappeared for several decades, he reappeared under a new alias, 'Kern'â€”a mechanic who caused havoc aboard the BioCruiser.",
