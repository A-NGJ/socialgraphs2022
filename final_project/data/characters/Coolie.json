 "content": "Coolie was apparently an aunt, real or adoptive, of Luke Skywalker.\nIn the novel Children of the Jedi, when Callista Ming told Luke about her uncle Dro's opposition to anyone having fun, the Jedi Master laughingly remarked that \"your uncle Dro  related to my aunt Coolie.\" However, Luke's aunt Coolie does not appear to be referred to in any other source.\nAdding to the uncertainty, the exchange in question took place in a dreamscape, while a feverish and injured Luke was trapped aboard the Imperial battlemoon Eye of Palpatine and Callista was a disembodied consciousness trapped inside the ship's gunnery computer.\nBased on this one reference, if Coolie existed  and was a nominal relative of Luke's , she was probably a member of either the Lars family or the Whitesun family.",
