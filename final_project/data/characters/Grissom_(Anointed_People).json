 "content": "Grissom was a male Godling, a member of the ruling class of the Anointed People from the planet Abonshee.\nIn 0 ABY, Masterhome was visited by Green squad of Reekeene's Roughnecks, an Irregular branch of the Alliance to Restore the Republic who wanted the Anointed People to join their faction, even if the Anointed People did not have space-level technology. During the negotiations, a damaged Imperial Curich-class shuttle, the Resurgence landed near the castle of the ruling Godking, Trisstan, to perform emergency repairs. Thirty stormtroopers left the ship and immediately surrounded it.\nGodking Trisstan ordered Grissom to approach the Imperial ship with a twenty-five being strong Honor Guard to question the new arrivals and determine their intent. Grissom obeyed and approached the ship, but a stormtrooper ordered him to stop. Grissom was confused, but he eventually kept walking, showing his hands were empty. The trooper shouted again, and then the Imperials fired on Grissom, his Guard and any civilian in range, killing them. This prompted Trisstan to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic and fight the Empire.",
