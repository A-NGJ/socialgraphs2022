 "content": "Jenth was an enslaved human of the Infinite Empire. A child of young age, Jenth had fair skin, short brown hair and brown eyes. Like all enslaved Force-sensitives of the Infinite Empire, Jenth was named after a letter in the Aurebesh alphabet—namely, the letter Jenth—and had the shape of the letter tattooed on their face. Jenth was brood mates with fellow enslaved Force-sensitives Xesh, Trill and Herf, and all four were among those who were used to power the machines of the Rakata species that ruled the Infinite Empire. Xesh's earliest memories was him, Jenth and the rest of the brood mates huddling together for warmth.\nJenth was first shown in a flashback scene from Xesh's past in Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1, the first issue in the The Prisoner of Bogan story arc of the Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi comic book series.",
