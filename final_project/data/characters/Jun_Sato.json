 "content": "Jun Sato was a human male who commanded the Phoenix Cell, a rebel cell that operated against the Galactic Empire in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin. He and his cell, which included a group of A-wing starfighters known as Phoenix Squadron, were affiliated with the larger rebel movement operated by Senator Bail Organa. At the recommendation of Senator Organa, Sato welcomed the Spectres into his fleet, and the two cells fought side by side in a number of engagements. Sato lost his command ship, Phoenix Home, after it was destroyed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, after which Sato transferred his command to the CR90 corvette Liberator and later the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Phoenix Nest.\nCommander Sato and Captain Hera Syndulla continued leading the Phoenix Squadron in the period between 3 BBY and 2 BBY. During this time, Sato saw action in numerous missions and skirmishes against the Empire. Phoenix Squadron later established a base called Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. He reunited with his nephew Mart Mattin during the skirmish above Mykapo. After Phoenix Squadron joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Sato's forces joined forces with General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group for a planned assault on Lothal. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn learned of their plans and attacked Atollon. Sato sacrificed his life during the Battle of Atollon in order to allow Ezra Bridger and Chopper to escape and seek help, killing Admiral Kassius Konstantine in the process.\nJun Sato was a human male from the planet Mykapo. As a young man, he was offered a spot in a crystal smuggling ring, which he took for credits. As a cover, he got himself accepted into the prestigious crystal processing school of the planet Isobe, in the Thustra system. When most natives were hostile and even violent to him, Sato found comfort and support with Princess Althea, daughter of the planetary leader Lord Hallux, who would even tend to his wounds. Eventually, Sato was caught red-handed smuggling stolen crystals. Although he defended himself that night in front of Lord Hallux, his son Thelan and a very dismayed Althea, Sato was found guilty of the charge and banished from Isobe for the rest of his life, on pain of death. Because of his shame and pride, Sato never tried to contact Althea again after his banishment, although there was much he wanted to tell her.\nBy 4 BBY, Commander Sato led the Phoenix Cell during the Age of the Empire. He and his forces were part of the larger rebel movement that was loosely organized by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila, and Commander Ahsoka Tano, the latter of whom operated as a rebel informant under the codename \"Fulcrum.\" He had a brother and a nephew named Mart Mattin who were members of a small Mykapo-based rebel cell called Iron Squadron. At some unknown point, Sato lost contact with them after Imperial forces attacked and killed his brother. However, Mattin survived and took over leadership of the Iron Squadron.\nLater, Commander Tano led forces from the Phoenix cell to the assistance of the Spectres, who mounted a mission to rescue their captive leader, the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, from Imperial custody over the planet Mustafar. After the rescue, Sato welcomed the Spectres into his fleet, after they were highly recommended by Senator Organa and Commander Tano.\nAs part of the rebel fleet, the Spectres, aboard their ship the Ghost, carried out a number of attacks against Imperial targets, securing fuel for Phoenix Home and the CR90 corvettes that it led. After one such attack, in which the Spectres led the Phoenix cell's group of A-wing fighters, known as Phoenix Squadron, in an attempt to steal Imperial shield generators, Sato commended the Ghost crew for their work. Captain Hera Syndulla of the Ghost regretted being unable to secure the shield generators for the fleet, but they had secured additional fuel to maintain Phoenix operations. It was then that the crew's astromech droid C1-10P, nicknamed \"Chopper,\" arrived in the Phoenix Home command center carrying a message from Lothal. The transmission was from Maketh Tua, a minister in Lothal's Imperial government, who requested that the rebels help her defect from the Empire in exchange for valuable intelligence; the secrets she was willing to share included the names of rebel sympathizers on Lothal and nearby worlds, as well as the true reason for the Empire's presence on Lothal. Commander Sato believed that the mission was worth the risk and allowed the Ghost crew to return to Lothal to help Minister Tua.\nThe rebels' return to their former world led to the Siege of Lothal, as Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau and Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith, pursued the rebels on the Outer Rim planet. The rebels escaped Lothal aboard a stolen shuttle after the Empire assassinated Tua, implicating the rebels in the crime, and they returned to Phoenix Home. Once there, they realized that the Empire had placed a tracking device on the shuttle. Their warning to Commander Sato came too late, however, as Darth Vader arrived alone in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Sato ordered Phoenix Squadron to engage the Dark Lord, but Vader was the superior pilot and destroyed most of the squadron. Vader's attack led to Phoenix Home suffering critical damage and, despite the suggestions of Captain Syndulla—who, along with her crew had boarded the Ghost to engage Vader—Sato at first refused to abandon the command ship. Once it was apparent that Phoenix Home was lost, Commander Sato changed his mind and ordered an evacuation. He and his crew escaped as a fleet of Star Destroyers jumped into the area, and the Ghost provided enough of a diversion so the crew could board the rest of the fleet and jump into hyperspace.\nThough the Phoenix cell suffered a significant defeat at the hands of Darth Vader, Sato and his crew survived, and the fleet rendezvoused at a location they had dubbed as Safe Haven. As a result of the loss of Phoenix Home, Sato transferred his command to the CR90 corvette Liberator, though he felt that it hampered the fleet's ability to fight the Empire. Ezra Bridger then suggested that they find a place to hide. Though Sato agreed with the young Jedi's suggestion, everyone argued that they don't know of a secure location to put up a base of operations. Tano then spoke up, claiming to know a friend who knew the locations of bases in the Outer Rim that would suit their purpose, and sent the Ghost crew to make contact. The crew eventually returned with Tano's friend, clone trooper Rex, who agreed to join the rebels.\nWhen the planet Rinn faced an energy crisis, Sato ordered the Spectres to see if they could find any fuel cells on Garel to take to Rinn.\nSometime later, Sato lent Phoenix Squadron and the CR90 corvette Transport One to a mission that involved delivering supplies to the famished people of the planet Ibaar, which had been decimated by an Imperial blockade. The initial attempt to break the blockade failed, as Transport 1, which was carrying the supplies, was destroyed. In addition, Phoenix Leader of Phoenix Squadron was killed during the combat. The survivors of the mission, including the crew of the Ghost, rendezvoused with the rest of the rebel fleet and met with Sato to discuss their options in regards to Ibaar. Rex suggested that they seek out an engineer named Quarrie, who had an experimental starfighter on hand that could change the course of the growing conflict. However, Quarrie happened to be located on the planet Shantipole. Two Phoenix Squadron pilots voiced their concerns for the plan, as Shantipole was known to be a \"one way trip\" for unskilled pilots. In response, Ghost crewmember and ex-Jedi Kanan Jarrus volunteered Captain Syndulla to go on the mission, as she was the rebels' best pilot. Sato agreed to the plan, and Syndulla, along with two of her other crew members, departed for Shantipole. However, Jarrus and Bridger stayed behind to use the Ghost for a second run against the blockade, which would happen if Syndulla was deemed to be taking too long.\nAfter waiting for Syndulla's return, Sato believed that enough time had passed, and loaded the Ghost with Ibaar's supplies. Rebel forces clashed again with the blockade. Despite the rebels' efforts, the Imperial vessels began to pin the rebel ships together. However, Syndulla finally returned behind the controls of Quarrie's experimental fighter and led the rebels to victory. After departing Ibaar, Sato was introduced to Quarrie, who had come along to join the rebels. Sato had been informed by Senator Organa that a friendly manufacturer had agreed to build more of Quarrie's fighters to support the growing rebellion. Recognizing Syndulla's piloting expertise, he promoted her as the next Phoenix Leader.\nFollowing the disappearance of a rebel patrol in the Del Zennis system, Jun Sato and the young Jedi rebel Ezra Bridger traveled on his CR90 corvette Liberator to investigate. Commander Sato had taken Bridger aboard for the mission at the recommendation of Hera Syndulla. While traveling through hyperspace, Bridger sensed a disturbance in the Force. Immediately, the corvette was pulled out of hyperspace and cornered by an Imperial Interdictor, a new prototype warship equipped with gravity well projectors. Before the ship's power systems shut down, Sato managed to send a distress transmission that was picked up by the crew of the Ghost.\nSato's corvette was then pulled into the ventral hangar of the Interdictor and boarded by Imperial forces. Commander Sato and Bridger were then brought before the ship's commanding officer, Admiral Brom Titus. Sato tried to convince Titus that he and his crew were members of the Corporate Alliance. However, this tactic failed since Titus quickly recognized his prisoners as Commander Sato and Ezra Bridger respectively. Knowing that his colleague, the Imperial Security Bureau agent Kallus, was looking for Bridger, he ordered his men to secure the prisoners.\nCommander Sato and his crew were confined in a detention cell while Bridger was led by three stormtroopers to a secure cell. However, Bridger managed to escape and link up with a rescue mission sent by Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla. This rescue mission consisted of the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, the former clone trooper Rex, and the astromech droid Chopper. While Chopper and Bridger went to sabotage the Interdictor's gravity well projectors, Jarrus and Rex managed to rescue Sato and his crew from their detention cell. Together, they made their way back to Sato's CR90 corvette but were pursued by stormtroopers.\nDuring the fighting, Rex stayed behind to hold off the stormtroopers and was captured. Shortly later, they were rejoined by Bridger and Chopper. The young Jedi soon took the lead as he bravely fought against a squad of stormtroopers, at which Sato urged his crew to follow Bridger's lead. Sato and the other rebels then managed to board the CR90 corvette while Jarrus went back to rescue Rex. After Jarrus and Rex escaped the Interdictor in an escape pod, Commander Sato prepared to make a jump into hyperspace. However, they were pulled out of hyperspace again by the Interdictor, which had been joined by two Arquitens-class light cruisers. Fortunately for Sato and the rebels, Chopper had sabotaged the Interdictor's gravity well projectors; causing the light cruisers to collide with the Interdictor. Commander Sato and his ship then managed to escape into hyperspace. Grateful to his rescuers, Sato thanked Jarrus, Rex, and Bridger for rescuing him and his crew.\nDue to an accidental leak by Ezra Bridger on Takobo, the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother learned that the Phoenix rebel cell was hiding on Garel. The two Inquisitors informed their Imperial colleagues Agent Kallus and Admiral Kassius Konstantine, who sent an Imperial fleet from Lothal to attack Garel City. During the escape, Sato was with the former Clone Captain Rex when the Liberator was caught in the tractor beam of the Imperial Star Destroyer Relentless, Konstantine's ship. However, Phoenix Leader Syndulla managed to free Sato and Rex by using the Ghost to ram into the Star Destroyer's tractor beam projector. This enabled Commander Sato and the remaining ships to escape into hyperspace.\nCommander Sato attended a meeting with several other rebels including the former Clone Captain Rex and the crew of the Ghost to discuss their options for opening a new hyperspace route to the Lothal sector. The Galactic Empire was hunting down rebel forces throughout the Outer Rim. Wren suggested the Concord Dawn system, which was home to a Mandalorian colony known as the Protectors. Due to the warlike and militant nature of the Mandalorians, Commander Sato believed that diplomacy would not work and recommended sending a military force to Concord Dawn. However, Wren and Syndulla managed to convince Commander Sato and the other rebels to send a diplomatic mission to obtain safe passage from the Protectors. Despite his reservations, Sato allowed Syndulla and Wren to proceed with their mission.\nSato's fears were proven when Syndulla's mission was attacked above Concord Dawn by the Protectors' Fang fighters. The Protectors' leader Fenn Rau had allied his people with the Empire and refused to negotiate with the rebels. Several RZ-1 A-wing interceptors were destroyed during the dogfight and Syndulla was seriously wounded. Sato was later present during a debriefing with Wren, Jarrus, Rex, and the other crew of the Ghost, minus Syndulla. With diplomacy no longer an option, Sato authorized a sabotage mission by Jarrus to destroy the Protectors' Fang starfighters, which were housed at a base on the third moon of Concord Dawn. This mission was a success and the rebels also succeeded in capturing Fenn Rau, who agreed to allow the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system in return for keeping his capture a secret from the Empire.\nFollowing the loss of one A-wing starfighter during one of Phoenix Squadron's missions, the Phoenix rebels needed a place to land and protect their remaining starfighters. In response, Sato suggested that Syndulla and Jarrus steal an Imperial Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier that had been orbiting Ryloth, the Twi'lek homeworld. Hera Syndulla and the Spectres made contact with the Twi'lek Resistance and their leader Cham Syndulla, her father. Together, the two rebel factions hatched a plan to steal the carrier. However, the mission was complicated by Cham's own agenda to destroy the carrier. After a struggle with both Cham's resistance fighters and Imperial reinforcements, the Spectres managed to capture the fighter carrier for the rebellion.\nCommander Sato convened a meeting aboard his new flagship, the former Imperial fighter carrier, to discuss the rebel plans to establish a base in the Yost system. By cross-referencing Republic and Lasat star charts, the friend of Sabine Ketsu Onyo had identified Berzite's moon as a prospective location for a rebel base. With the fighter carrier low on fuel, Wren recommended raiding the Imperial fuel depot on Horizon Base. Using this information, Sato sanctioned a mission by the crew of the Ghost to steal the fuel.\nShorty later, the rebel fleet was attacked by Imperial forces under Admiral Konstantine. After the Ghost landed on the fighter-carrier with the fuel supplies, Sato prepared the fleet to depart for the Yost system. However, Syndulla received information from Chopper and the Imperial inventory droid AP-5 that the Empire had set a trap there. After AP-5 instead transmitted the coordinates to Atollon, a safe world lacking an Imperial presence, Sato and the rest of the fleet traveled there.\nFollowing the discovery of Atollon, the Phoenix rebels established a new base called Chopper Base, in honor of Chopper. Sato remained aboard the rebel fighter carrier while the crew of the Ghost traveled to the base to deliver a shipment of power generators. Despite encountering a nest of Krykna, Phoenix Leader Syndulla managed to secure the base by erecting a perimeter fence of sensor beacons around it which deterred the Krykna. This allowed the rebels to protect their base on Atollon.\nSato was later present when Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger returned from their mission to Malachor. He, the other Spectres, Rex, and the inventory droid AP-5 watched as a blinded Jarrus embraced Syndulla. He later watched as a despondent Bridger emerged from the starship without the rebel operative and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who had presumably died on Malachor.\nAbout six months later, Sato attended a briefing with the Spectres, Rex, and the rescued pirate Hondo Ohnaka. The Spectres had rescued Hondo from the Imperial prison on the rocky planet of Naraka. As payment for his rescue, Hondo demanded that the rebels supply him with a hyperspace-capable smuggling vessel and a crew. Sato responded that the rebels would only pay him if his information was proven correct.\nAt Sato's prompting, Hondo revealed that the Imperials were operating a floating junkyard called Reklam Station in the planet Yarma where Old Republic Y-wing starfighters were being scrapped. Sato agreed to Syndulla's request that the rebels undertake a reconnaissance mission of Reklam Station. He also promoted Bridger to Lieutenant Commander due to his actions during Hondo's rescue and gave him command of the Reklam heist. After learning that Bridger had disobeyed orders and embarked on a recovery mission, Sato, Syndulla, and Jarrus traveled to Yarma and rescued Bridger's team and the stolen Y-wings.\nLater, Commander Sato chaired a briefing where he informed the Spectres of the destruction of a rebel convoy to Teralov. When Ezra expressed his despondency about the high casualties, Sato revealed that a rebel agent named \"Fulcrum\" had information that several cadets from the Imperial Skystrike Academy were planning to defect to the rebels. Sato was present when Hera assigned Sabine the mission. After Sabine's return from the Skystrike Academy, Sato welcomed Wedge Antilles and Derek Klivian to the rebellion.\nAfter the rebellion lost contact with the Protectors on the third moon of Concord Dawn, Commander Sato and Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla summoned the Protectors' leader Fenn Rau for a briefing in the war room aboard a CR90 corvette. While Sato thought that the Protectors were setting a trap, Rau assured him that this was not the case and suspected that something had gone wrong. Rau along with Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper then departed on a recon mission to Concord Dawn to investigate. There, they discovered that the Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos had wiped out the Protectors. As a result, Rau decided to join the rebellion.\nLater, Commander Sato received intelligence that Imperial forces were about to launch a crackdown on rebel sympathizers on Mykapo. Sato dispatched Phoenix Leader Syndulla and elements of Phoenix Squadron to evacuate the civilians. The rebels stumbled upon a skirmish between Mart's Iron Squadron and an Imperial advance patrol. After eliminating the Imperial patrol, Phoenix Squadron evacuated the dissidents. Hera also informed Commander Sato about Iron Squadron. Realizing that his nephew had survived, Jun pleaded with Hera and Kanan to bring him back safely. Hera, Ezra and Sabine tried to reason with Mart and his crew but they insisted on staying at Mykapo. Unable to reason with Mart, Hera returned to the rebel fleet.\nEzra, Sabine, and Chopper stayed behind and managed to convince Mart's crew members Gooti Terez, Jonner Jin, and R3-A3 to leave with them. However, Mart decided to face Imperial reinforcements led by Admiral Konstantine. When Mart's ship Sato's Hammer, a ship Sato used to own, sustained damage, the Spectres and the other Iron Squadron members were forced to retreat without him. Hera later informed Jun via hologram about Mart's predicament and played a distress signal from the youth. Sato offered to travel to Mykapo to save his nephew but Hera convinced him that she and her crew would be able to handle the matter. Hera managed to rescue Mart and his ship. Sato and his forces arrived in time to attack Admiral Konstantine's ships.\nSato ordered two A-wings to provide covering fire and reassured Mart that he had come to rescue him. After Mart damaged Konstantine's Arquitens-class command cruiser with a bomb, the rebel ships flew past the derelict warship. Before they could jump into hyperspace, they narrowly collided with an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn addressed Sato over the com and questioned why he had returned. Sato responded \"now you know until we meet again.\" Thrawn vowed to meet him again and allowed Sato's forces to escape. Back at Chopper Base, Sato embraced Mart and thanked Hera and her crew for saving his nephew. He told Hera that he owed her and her crew a great debt.\nCommander Sato stayed back at Chopper Base with Hera, Sabine, and Zeb while Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper undertook a mission to infiltrate the Lothal Imperial Armory Complex with the help of local rebels Ryder Azadi and Morad Sumar. Sato listened while Ryder informed Hera of the new Imperial commander Grand Admiral Thrawn, whom Sato had encountered earlier above Mykapo.\nCommander Sato appeared beside Senator Bail Organa, a key ally of the rebellion, during a hologram conversation with the Spectres and Rex. Sato watched as Senator Organa briefed the rebels about Rebel Command losing contact with Saw Gerrera during a mission to investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species. Organa tasked the Spectres and Rex with rescuing Saw and recovering his data. Hera's team succeeded in rescuing Saw, befriending the Geonosian Klik-Klak and discovering irrefutable evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosian species. After Hera and her team reported their finding, Commander Sato described their mission as a success because they rescued Saw and obtained a deflector core.\nCommander Sato and several other rebels including AP-5 and Rex were present at Chopper Base's command center when the former Imperial Senator Mon Mothma delivered a HoloNet speech condemning the Empire and urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion. This speech led to the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nAfter Ezra heard Kanan Jarrus' holocron and the Sith holocron from Malachor sending messages that hinted that the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was in danger from the former Sith apprentice Maul, Commander Sato, Rex, and the Spectres attended a meeting to discuss Ezra's encounter. During the meeting, Hera told Ezra to remain on Atollon because they needed him for the upcoming strike on Lothal. However, Ezra disregarded Hera's orders and traveled with Chopper on a mission to find Kenobi on Tatooine.\nCommander Sato was aboard the Phoenix Nest when General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group exited hyperspace to join Phoenix Squadron's planned assault on the TIE Defender factories on Lothal. After hailing Dodonna's warship Vanguard, Sato attend a hologram conference with Captain Syndulla, General Dodonna, and Ryder Azadi, their Lothal contact. Sato was present when a transmission was received from Fulcrum, informing the rebels that Grand Admiral Thrawn had uncovered the location of their base and was en route. Thrawn's fleet arrived moments later.\nDuring the Battle of Atollon, Imperial-class Star Destroyers easily destroyed many of Phoenix Squadron's ships as well as most of General Dodonna's fleet. The rebels were unable to escape due to an active Interdictor cruiser, commanded by Admiral Konstantine. In order to disable the ship, Sato ordered the crew of Phoenix Home to abandon ship and subsequently drove the craft into Konstantine's. Both Sato and Konstantine were killed in the collision but Sato's sacrifice enabled Ezra Bridger and Chopper to escape offworld aboard the Gauntlet to seek help.\nCommander Sato's sacrifice was not in vain, as it allowed Ezra and Chopper to seek help from Sabine and Clan Wren on Krownest to take down the second Interdictor cruiser. Because of the reinforcements, the remainders of Phoenix Squadron and the Massassi Group were able to escape Thrawn's blockade and arrive on Yavin 4. Sato was buried there, near the ancient temples of the Massassi Site, a black gravestone marking his final resting place.\nJun Sato was a human male with brown-but-greying hair and brown eyes. He was a by-the-books commander, operating his cell using military protocols. He was grateful that the Ghost had become part of his fleet and felt that the rebels had proven invaluable to the rebellion's cause, though he also believed that the Spectres lacked effective discipline. During Darth Vader's assault on the Phoenix fleet, Sato at first refused to allow his crew to abandon Phoenix Home, as he was unwilling to lose his own command ship. Once he realized that the ship was lost, however, he regretfully agreed with Captain Syndulla's advice to order his crew to evacuate the ship.\nSato was a strategist who realized the importance of the rebellion in winning new recruits, new starships, and finding a base. He was a courageous commander even in the face of adversity. When captured by Admiral Brom Titus, Sato was not afraid and tried to intimidate the Admiral by claiming that he and his crew were members of the Corporate Alliance. Sato realized that Ezra Bridger had good leadership potential and promoted the youth to Lieutenant Commander following a successful prison heist on Naraka. However, Sato overlooked Ezra's aggressive streak and brush with the dark side of the Force.\nSato had a brother and a nephew named Mart Mattin. After losing his brother, Sato thought he had lost his family until Hera encountered Mart during a mission to Mykapo. Sato was determined to do anything to reunite with his nephew. He was grateful to Hera and her crew for risking their lives to save Mart. Sato regarded Mart as stubborn and rebellious but still loved his nephew. The two happily embraced each other during their reunion at Chopper Base.\nSato was ready to lay down his life for the rebellion. Sato sacrificed his life by ramming his command ship Phoenix Home into an interdictor cruiser. His sacrifice enabled Ezra and Chopper to escape and seek reinforcements offworld.\nCommander Jun Sato was a character created for the second season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels. He made his first appearance in Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal, the television movie that kicked off the show's second season, in which he was voiced by Keone Young. The character was first revealed in Rebels Recon, a behind the scenes video series hosted on StarWars.com, for the first season finale \"Fire Across the Galaxy.\" The video provided concept art for Commander Sato, as well as for Phoenix Squadron and the entire Phoenix rebel cell.\nHis name is derived from Japanese film director Jun Fukuda and composer Masaru Sato, who worked together on the Godzilla series, including Dave Filoni's favorite film, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.\nIn the 2018 reference book Star Wars: The Rebel Files, Jun Sato's surname is misspelled as \"Soto.\"",
