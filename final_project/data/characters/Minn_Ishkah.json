 "content": "Minn Ishkah was a Nautolan female ambassador in the Republic Diplomatic Corps of the Galactic Republic. Around 3626 BBY, she was present on Manaan to make diplomatic relations with the Selkath after the imperial Invasion of Manaan.\nMinn Ishkah began her career as a special envoy between General Elin Garza, Havoc Squad, and the Republic Senate. Her appointment came shortly after an incident on Ando Prime, in which Garza dispatched Havoc Squad without authorization or approval. Soon Ishkah's superiors realised that she had liitle infuence on Garza and got removed from that position.\nIn 3626 BBY, after the invasion of Manaan, Ishkah was sent there to form an allience between the Selkath and the Republic.\nWith her time spent around General of Republic Special Forces Ishkah seemed to have adopted Garza's brash demeanor and impulsiveness, as well as her opinions on where, when, and how the Republic military should be involved. By the time she was removed from her position, she had formed many close contacts within the military who shared her fervent belief in the Republic's superiority over the Empire.",
