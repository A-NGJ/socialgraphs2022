 "content": "Domm  was a male Zabrak criminal living inside the Greenwood Station dome on Nox.\nDomm was a business contact of the criminal Tre Sana, a Twi'lek who worked out of Kalimahr. His face was scarred from a hard life of illegal work, and he smelled of chemical intoxicants. His father was decapitated by a Je'daii during the Despot War at the battle at Kaleth. In 25,793 BBY he was visited by Sana and the Je'daii Ranger Lanoree Brock, who pressed him for information regarding the location of Maxhagan. Lanoree Brock used the Force to sense his intentions and to draw the info they needed from his mind. Getting directed to District Six of Greenwood Station, Brock pulled flecks of skin dust from the floor up into Domm's nostrils and to his brain. Employing alchemy of the flesh to meld the skin flakes into Domm's brain, she was able to erase Domm's memory after the encounter so that he would not report on them. Brock couldn't be sure how long her alchemy would last, but for a time Domm wouldn't remember his own name.",
