 "content": "Zaryos was a male Human who lived at the Jedi Colony established on Ossus. \nDuring the Invasion of Ossus by the Sith Empire the colony was due to be evacuated, but Zaryos explained to Nadia Grell, Tau Idair and the Alliance Commander that they could not leave until they had downloaded their data to his astromech droid D9-S2, emphasizing that they found out how to grow crops in a radioactive wasteland, and that such information would be invaluable to the Republic. Idair assured Zaryos that they had it covered, and that he should get to the shuttles so everyone could get loaded up faster. When the Commander also insisted upon it, Zaryos relented and left the data in the hands of Idair, Nadia, and the Commander, just as Imperial soldiers arrived.",
