 "content": "A Sullustan male teahouse shopkeep lived in a village located Ã¶n planet Genbara in the Outer Rim Territories. The village was attacked by Sith bandits approximately two decades after the Sith rebellion against the Empire.\nShortly before the Sith bandit gang attacked, a mysterious traveler known as \"The Ronin\" arrived at the village with an astromech droid companion B5-56 and stayed with the teahouse shopkeeper. The shopkeeper spoke to the Ronin and B5 in Galactic Basic Standard and Sullustese. When B5 sustained damage, Ronin asked the teahouse keeper to repair his droid before a kettle of tea boiled. After the shopkeeper repaired B5, the astromech droid launched a barrage of missiles at the bandits, helping its master defeat Kouru.",
