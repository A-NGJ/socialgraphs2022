 "content": "Jooks was a female Theelin who resided on the Colossus refueling station on Castilon in the later stages of the Cold War between the First Order and the Resistance. She was a regular at Aunt Z's tavern.\nWhen Kazuda Xiono first visited Aunt Z's Tavern, Glem was just telling Jooks about Kazuda's reputation as both of them entered the establishment. Shortly thereafter a brawl ensued, in which Jooks picked a fight with Yani. She was positioned on Narb's back when Jarek Yeager ordered an end to the fight.\nThe next morning, before the race between Kazuda and Torra Doza, Jooks appeared to have spend the night in the open air on the deck of the Colossus, awakening next to a barrel together with Narb.\nJooks could sometimes be seen as part of Hype Fazon's entourage, but always knew when to keep her distance if Hype decided to talk to someone else.\nWhen Kaz found himself in a precarious situation on the outside ledges of Doza's Tower, his plight was clearly visible from Aunt Z's Tavern. Jooks bet 60 credits that Kazudo would fall off.\nJooks was a female Theelin with magenta hair and spotted pink skin.\nJooks is a character created and developed for Star Wars Resistance. She is voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.",
