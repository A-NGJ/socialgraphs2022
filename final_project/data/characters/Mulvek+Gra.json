 "content": "Mulvek Gar was a sergeant in the Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations stationed on Celanon. He was too old for field duty, but had served previously with Jared Brojtal and was like an uncle to his son. When the boy was killed during the Bombing of Syndaar Military Prep School, he vowed to assist Jared in any way possible to locate Ort Hoogra-D'En, the terrorist responsible.\nMulvek kept an eye on a group of heroes who accepted the bounty on Ort and fed the leads they discovered back to Jared.",
