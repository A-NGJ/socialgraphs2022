 "content": "Patla Soo was a female Caarite, who worked for the Metatheran Cartel during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, Soo had became the Operations Manager of Cartel Central, the base of operations of the Cartel on Caarimon. When the Believers attempted to release a dangerous virus on Caarimon, a group of freelance agents, who were investigating the plot, asked Soo some questions during the course of their investigations. The agents were able to prevent the release of the virus and Soo attended a celebration that was held on Dorumaa to thank them. During the event, she made a speech where she expressed her gratitude to the agents.",
