 "content": "Captain-Supervisor Grammel was an Imperial Army officer who commanded the Imperial mining operation on Circarpous V.\nGrammel earned a reputation as a ruthless, sadistic officer, routinely torturing prisoners, whether he needed to or not.\nWhen he learned of the existence of the Kaiburr crystal and the presence of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, he informed Governor Bin Essada, who in turn informed Darth Vader.\nHowever, the two prisoners escaped from custody with the help of two Yuzzem, Hin and Kee, and their fellow Human Halla. During the chaos, Grammel was injured in an explosion that burned a significant portion of his face, his right arm having to be \"re-formed\" and his ear damaged. Upon Darth Vader's arrival, the Sith Lord was disappointed with Grammel over his failure to prevent them from escaping. Worse, Vader took over the command of Grammel's troops.\nGrammel was ordered to seize the Rebel Alliance leaders, a task he failed to complete. Despite—or perhaps as a result of—his pleas and excuses, Grammel was executed by Darth Vader for his incompetence.",
