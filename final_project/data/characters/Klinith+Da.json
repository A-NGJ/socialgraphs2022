 "content": "Klinith Da was a human female pirate who held the rank of Strike in Kassav's Tempest within the Nihil during the High Republic Era. Klinith and fellow Nihil pirate Gwishi were dispatched to sabotage the starship Steady Wing as it left the outpost of Port Haileap. By succeeding in her mission, Klinith hoped to receive a promotion within the Nihil's ranks.\nIn 232 BBY, Klinith and Gwishi, an Aqualish member of the Nihil, arrived in Port Haileap aboard a stolen cargo hauler. Sent by the Nihil to destroy the Steady Wing, a massive cruiser carrying multiple Republic dignitaries, she and Gwishi boarded the ship, disguised as mechanics. Immediately, Klinith headed for the escape pods in an attempt to destroy them so as to leave no survivors. There, she encountered a droid, which she destroyed with a hydrospanner after it became suspicious of her activities.\nKlinith Da had magenta hair, tattoos, and multiple piercings, including a complex silver-wire piercing wound into her lower lip. She wore a green jacket, gray pants, fingerless gloves, and had a blaster holstered on each leg.\nKlinith Da first appeared as the main antagonist of the 2021 junior novel The High Republic: A Test of Courage, written by Justina Ireland and illustrated by Petur Antonsson.",
