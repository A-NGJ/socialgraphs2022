 "content": "Gizmal Gam was a male Human bureaucrat who lived on the planet of Ord Mantell. Gizmel lived in and owned a home in Oradam village, and he was found attempting to find assistance in retrieving a shipment of supplies he lost which he planned to give a local village in order to gain their favor and to keep them from joining the Separatists. In truth however, his supplies were actually a shipment of illegal spice. Gizmal Gam met with several heroes who were on Ord Mantell at the time who may or may not have aided him in recovering his shipment.",
