 "content": "Zephyr was a human male Elder from the planet Polyneus. In 5 ABY, Wyl Lark contacted Zephyr after leaving Chass na Chadic in the hangar after the skirmish at the Circus of Mortal Appetites to express his desire to return home and relayed General Syndulla's assurances that the war was ending. After explaining that he had to stay until they had stopped the second Operation: Cinder, the elder looked sadly and told him of Stam Groundling of the village of Tor who had returned to Polyneus the day before. To Lark's question of why he told him this story, he explained that Lark was the last of the Hundred and Twenty who had left to fight the Galactic Empire to not return or die.\nZephyr was mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed.",
