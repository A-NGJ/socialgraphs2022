 "content": "Desanne was an Imperial Navy Commander from Kalist VI. Due to a political blunder in 3 ABY, Commander Desanne was stripped of most official duties and relegated to shuttling dignitaries and high-ranking Imperial officials. After Darth Vader failed to catch Luke Skywalker on Cloud City, Vader had Desanne bring his shuttle to transport him to the Executor.\nDesanne, a human male, hailed from the Planet Kalist VI in the Deep Core. During the Galactic Civil War, he served in the Imperial Navy as a Commander. He was stripped of most official duties due to a political blunder in the year 3 ABY, and as a result, he was relegated to shuttling dignitaries and high-ranking Imperials.\nThat year, Desanne was present in holographic form during a conference of twenty other battleships aboard the Star Dreadnought Executor, the flagship of the Sith Darth Vader, to discuss the whereabouts of a Corellian YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon, which had escaped the secret Rebel base during the Battle of Hoth. During the meeting, at least one officer was killed when an asteroid hit the bridge of his Star Destroyer.\nLater, Desanne was on Cloud City, with a small unit of Imperial stormtroopers accompanying him. After Vader tracked the freighter to the city, he captured the ship's pilot, Han Solo, and the rest of its crew. Sometime later, he also encountered Luke Skywalker, the young man who blew up the Death Star battlestation three years prior. They dueled, and Skywalker eventually escaped Vader's wrath, along with what remained of the Falcon's crew. Desanne and his stormtroopers later accompanied Vader, who told Desanne to alert his Star Destroyer to prepare for his arrival. They then entered a Lambda-class shuttle and departed towards the Executor to continue the pursuit.\nDesanne had Brown hair and light skin.\nDesanne wore the standard-issue Imperial officer's uniform. He had one code cylinder, and his rank insignia plaque displayed six red and blue squares.\nDesanne first appeared as an unnamed Imperial officer accompanying Vader in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. In the film, he was portrayed by English actor Patrick Ginter, who was uncredited for his role. Ginter's scenes on Bespin were likely filmed on July 6, 1979. According to Ginter, he also appeared as Desanne in holographic form, to Captain Lorth Needa's right. He was later given a name and a brief backstory in the November 1997 Cloud City Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
