 "content": "Thall Joben's mother lived with her partner on the planet Beheboth. A champion speeder racer, her partner was almost killed in a crash two days before the birth of their son, Thall. When he later refused to let Thall become a racer himself, Thall stowed aboard a freighter bound for the planet Boonta. Only upon his father's death, at some point prior to 15 BBY, did Thall return to Beheboth. At the funeral, Thall's mother told him about his father's former career. She died herself a few months later.",
