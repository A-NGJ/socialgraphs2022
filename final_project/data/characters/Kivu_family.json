 "content": "The Kivu family was a family in the Chiss Ascendancy, the nation of the Chiss species. It was considered one of the most obscure families of the Ascendancy by Mitth family Syndic Mitth'urf'ianico \"Thurfian,\" and was unable to prepare its members for military service, lacking the resources to do so. Part of the family, containing Kivu'raw'nuru \"Vurawn\", later known as Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn\", was based on the planet Rentor. Kivu'rik'ardok \"Vurika\" was a member of the family before she was taken from her family when she was five to become a sky-walker—a Force-sensitive young girl that navigated Chiss starships through the Unknown Regions—and after she stopped being a sky-walker when she had around fourteen years, Vurika joined the Ruling Irizi family.\nFollowing the Chiss victory against the war-like Grysk species at Thrawn's last stand, Thurfian—who had become Patriarch of the Mitth— recommended that Thrawn returned to the Kivu family as retribution for his violation of Chiss Ascendancy law: attacking the Grysks before they attacked him. However, the Patriarch was talked out of it by Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk.\nThe Kivu family first appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2020 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, the first volume of the The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
