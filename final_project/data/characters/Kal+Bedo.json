 "content": "Kal Bedo was a male Kaleesh living during the Galactic War.\nKal Bedo was born in an unknown period during the Great Galactic War. Following the Treaty of Coruscant, he began to engage in criminal activity until he was sent to the planet Belsavis and formed a gang of other members to join by his side.\nAround 3641 BBY, Kal received information about him and his members from an unknown person, so he and his men kidnapped Imperial individuals and held them hostage in the Maximum Security Section. He soon contacted a representative from the Sith Empire and demanded the release of the hostages transport from the planet. Sergeant Tark agreed to negotiate, but also secretly sent an Imperial operative of the Empire, who managed to free the prisoners, and killed Kal and his subordinates.",
