 "content": "Thark was a male Aqualish Imperial informant who lived during the Galactic Civil War. He was killed by a spacer, fooled by Mos Taike citizen Bren Kingal into believing that Thark was actually a crook.\nThark was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the appearance of Thark changed each time a player performed this quest. Under his spawn template, he would either appear as a green-skinned, brown haired male Aqualish, or as a green-skinned, brown haired female Aqualish. The quest dialogue given by Bren Kingal established Thark as a male. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining him revealed him to be a scout. However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Thark being placed under the randomized Aqualish scout spawn template appearance.",
