 "content": "Arner Figgis was an Issori linguist and anthropologist who advanced the controversial survival-regressive-isolationist theory, which alleged that colonists who survived a disaster might, if isolated from other colonists, be forced by necessity to abandon high technology and adopt characteristics of more primitive Human cultures. One possible example of Figgis' theory was the Bharhulai tribe on Socorro.\nArner Figgis served as the Chief Linguist for the University of Be'nal on Issor and achieved tenure at the Imperial Academy of Science and Methodology despite being non-human.\nHe travelled to Socorro to study the Socorran language and its links to Old Corellian. The scholar hired Trep Winterrs to help him. They travelled to the Black Dust Tavern so he could practice speaking the language with the bartender Karl Ancher. However, Figgis mispronounced a phrase and angered the bartender. Winterrs was able to smooth things over and invited Figgis to join him in a game of sabbaac so he could converse with the players.",
