 "content": "Shalla Ro was a female Evereni who was a member of the Ro family, the individual responsible for bringing many Nihil together, and the grandmother of future Eyes of the Nihil Asgar Ro and Marchion Ro. Shalla kept the navigator Mari San Tekka as an unwitting prisoner to utilize the hyperspace Paths which San Tekka uniquely possessed the ability to locate and utilize. Shalla asked San Tekka how her gift worked many times, but she was never able to explain.\nShalla was born to an Evereni woman who created the feared Nihil. Shalla eventually brought many members of the Nihil together, including tempest runners Pan Eyta and Kassav Milliko. At some point, she had a son named Asgar. He went on to have his own son, Marchion.\nTwenty years before the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Shalla had a disagreement with Asgar Ro. She wanted to wait for the right time to deploy the Nihil, but Asgar, stating that they shouldn't wait any longer, wanted to start using Mari San Tekka's navigational abilities. Shalla suggested that Asgar go out into the galaxy, like his father and grandfather before him, and start getting kills. Asgar responded by sending Shalla off a railing, causing her to fall and die on impact with the floor. Asgar would go on to become the first Eye of the Nihil, and demonstrate the power of the Battle Paths, through which he gained their subservience due to this advantage.\nShalla Ro was first mentioned, without her name, in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule. She first appeared and was named in a flashback in the 2022 comic The High Republic: Eye of the Storm 1, written by Charles Soule, illustrated by Guillermo Sanna and Jim Campbell, and published by Marvel Comics on January 12, 2022.",
