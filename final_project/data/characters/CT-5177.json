 "content": "CT-5177, ironically nicknamed \"Chatterbox,\" was a quiet and reserved clone trooper in Breakout Squad during the Clone Wars. He served in the Mission to Kynachi. He hardly talked at all, which led to one trooper to say that Chatterbox would beat Knuckles in a quiet contest, as he didn't even snore. Along with fellow troopers Breaker, Sharp and Knuckles, he formed the famed Breakout Squad, led by Jedi Padawan Nuru Kungurama. On a diplomatic mission into Chiss space, freighter pilot Lalo Gunn developed a liking for him. They then became trapped by a black hole but escaped using an ancient artifact. Breakout Squad and Chatterbox then went to Vaced, and an imagecaster led them to Bilbringi Depot. There, he was shot by a B1-Series battle droid and wounded. Breakout Squad then returned to Coruscant. Their next mission was to escort a freighter to Fondor, and then rescued younglings from pirates on Foless.\nCT-5177, known as \"Chatterbox,\" was a Galactic Republic clone trooper, a soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic and a clone of the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett. At the time of the Clone Wars, he stood 1.83 meters tall. In 21 BBY, Chatterbox served on the mission to Kynachi, under the command of Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase and Captain Lock. Their transport was ambushed, leading to the death of Lock and the disappearance of Ambase. Chatterbox and his fellow clones, along with the Jedi Padawan Nuru Kungurama, rallied and liberated the planet from its occupation by the Techno Union and Overseer Umbrag. The clones became known as the Breakout Squad. The squad was able to acquire transport from Captain Lalo Gunn on her ship, the Hasty Harpy.\nOn orders from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Breakout Squad ventured to the Chiss Ascendancy for a meeting at Defense Force Station Ifpe'a. There they met Aristocra Sev'eere'nuruodo and rescued her from a Techno Union attack. After escaping into hyperspace, they became trapped near a black hole with Hethra Mcgrrrr's pirate gang. Kungurama and Breakout Squad located an ancient Infinity Gate with a pair of Sullustan xenoarchaeologists. During the mission, Chatterbox grew close to Captain Gunn.\nEn route to Coruscant, Breakout Squad was contacted by Chancellor Palpatine and asked to divert to Vaced to meet Kynachi's Commissioner Langu Sommilor. The Commissioner was assassinated just after his arrival. Chatterbox and Breakout Squad pursued the sniper. They got onboard Gunn's ship and clashed with the sniper's transport, which ended with both ships crashing and the apparent death of the sniper. Gunn and Breakout Squad parted ways, but not before she shared a kiss with Chatterbox. Kungurama found an imagecaster which led Breakout Squad to take Sommilor's freighter to Bilbringi Depot, where they clashed with Umbrag again. They freed the depot from the droid forces, but the last battle droid shot Chatterbox in the back.\nBreakout Squad finished the investigation of the Depot, and discovered that the Sommilor who had been killed on Vaced was an impostor; the real Sommilor was freed from his captivity in the freighter's hold. Clone medics arrived and stabilized Chatterbox, with the rest of Breakout Squad donating blood, excepting Sharp. They then returned to Coruscant, where they planned on taking Chatterbox to the Jedi Temple for treatment. Jedi Master Harro Kelpura, though, ordered the freighter to change course to his lab in Dacho District, which had been broken into. The ship was then damaged by an impact with another dropship, which crashed but was able to take off and escape. After Kungurama confronted his missing master, Ambase, Chatterbox was returned to the Temple for care. He recovered in time for Breakout Squad to investigate the disappearances of the Spice Siren.\nBreakout Squad's next mission was to escort Noggox the Hutt's freighter to Fondor. When they arrived at the rendezvous on Affa, they discovered a massacre, but they continued their mission to Fondor, where they defeated the pirate Dool Pundar. Once there, their ally Gizz befriended a blind Twi'lek, Kuvuta Pindi. Kungurama agreed to help her escort orphaned younglings to Foless. Once there, they realized Pindi was trying to steal the orphans, and gave chase. They captured Pundar and freed the younglings, but Pindi was killed.\nChatterbox appeared in Ryder Windham's young readers series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Secret Missions. He and Breakout Squad was first pictured in the comic The Clone Wars: Opress Unleashed, a comic released in 2011 as part of Free Comic Book Day and later included in the comic The Clone Wars: Strange Allies.",
