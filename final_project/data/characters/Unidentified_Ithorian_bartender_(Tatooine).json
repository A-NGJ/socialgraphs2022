 "content": "An Ithorian bartender was the owner of the Mos Espa Podracer Cantina. He served drinks to whoever came by, especially a lone Jawa. His cantina was actually only open to Podracer pilots and mechanics and only in the weeks leading up to the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY, which was won by Anakin Skywalker. His cantina was relatively small but boasted a large holoprojector that was exclusively stored with facts about Podracing.\nThe Ithorian bartender first appeared in the 1999 video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer during transitions from the main menu and the racer select area and is tapping his hands on the counter. The cantina patrons varied between game characters and Qui-Gon Jinn. However, there was always a lone Jawa that appeared consistently in the bar.",
