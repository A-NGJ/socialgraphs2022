 "content": "Jullisa Senerio was a Human female from the world of Freliq, and was the daughter of the farmer Yasil Senerio. One day, while out playing, she accidentally slipped of a ledge, but managed to grab a plank of wood and hold on. Her father came running to her after hearing her scream, but a roaming lepusa got there first. The creature took a rope made of vine and lowered it down to the hanging Jullisa, saving her life.",
