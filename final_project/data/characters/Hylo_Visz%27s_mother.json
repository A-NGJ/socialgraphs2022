 "content": "Hylo Visz's mother was a female Mirialan who lived on Balmorra with her husband and daughter during the Great Galactic War. When the Sith Empire launched an assault on the world, her husband was killed and she and Hylo were forced to flee the planet alongside hundreds of other refugees. Despite escaping the battle alive, the Mirialan women came down with a severe illness during their flight from the conflict. While their refugee transport stopped over on the \"Smuggler's Moon\" of Nar Shaddaa, Hylo's mother died, leaving the young Mirialan an orphan. Hylo Visz went on to become a galaxy-renowned smuggler. Just before she contracted her illness, she stained her favorite robes. This was an event that led to Hylo's belief in the Invisible Law of the Universe.",
