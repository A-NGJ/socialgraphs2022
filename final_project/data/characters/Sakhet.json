 "content": "Sakhet was a female Kupohan spy who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, often working with Bothan spies. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, which saw the destruction of the Imperial superweapon, the Death Star, Luke Skywalker saved her son's life when two Imperial TIE Fighters attempted to destroy his ship in the Llanic system. He brought a message to the Rebel Alliance from Drusil Bephorin, who was a brilliant Givin cryptographer.\nBephorin stated that she would join the Rebels if they rescued her and her family. The Rebels sent Bren Derlin to rescue her family. Luke and Nakari Kelen traveled to the planet Denon where the cryptographer was under Imperial control. Sakhet was the contact who owned a noodle hut on the planet.\nWhen they found the house, they ordered Corellian buckwheat noodles with nerf nuggets and onions as well as with rancor sauce, to signify their true intent. On the receipt for the food there was a message which read: Return omorrow at 0900. The next morning, the two met with Sakhet and helped with food delivering and told which location will be visited by Bephorin. After some exculpation about if anything would go wrong, they decided to keep contact with the Kupohan spies. They were instructed to tell other Kupohan contacts that Sakhet that made the best nerf nuggets.",
