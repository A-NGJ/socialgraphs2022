 "content": "Gelly Farls was a female Human who lived on the planet of Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nFarls was married to Mambo Farls, who worked designing corporate uniforms. She herself was a botanist and was employed by the company Biotherapy in their labs in the city of Gadrin, on Cularin. She was also a member of the Bark Lovers' Alliance, a local environmental group.\nIn 32 BBY, Mambo mentioned to Gelly that he was developing a new uniform for security staff at Culpharm, a rival company of Biotherapy. She provided Biotherapy with a set of the uniforms, which she hoped they would use for illegal purposes, which the Bark Lovers' could then expose.",
