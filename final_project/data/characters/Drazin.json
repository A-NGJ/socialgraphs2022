 "content": "Drazin was an Imperial stormtrooper corporal assigned to assigned to Gamma Squad during the Occupation of Bespin. He later served in Commander Igar's honor guard on Endor.\nDrazin was born on Cloud City, over the gas giant of Bespin. At some point, he chose to enlist in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire, eventually achieving the rank of corporal.\nAssigned to Gamma Squad, he accompanied Darth Vader to Cloud City in 3 ABY to capture Luke Skywalker during the Occupation of Bespin. While there, he and some other troopers were assigned to help the city's Ugnaught engineers prepare the carbon-freezing chamber. Him and another trooper were sitting down when C-3PO, Luke's protocol droid, accidentally entered the room they were in. Drazin confronted C-3PO, asking who he was while aiming his weapon at him. C-3PO tried to apologize but Drazin rose from his chair and blasted him, in order to prevent C-3PO from blowing the Empire's cover.\nIn 4 ABY, Drazin became a member of Commander Igar's personal honor guard, and with that, Tempest Force, an elite formation of Imperial Army, Imperial Navy, and Stormtrooper Corps units that was tasked with guarding the shield generator bunker on the forest moon of Endor and shooting R2-D2, being after shot down by Han Solo.\nIn the non-canon comic series Star Wars: Tag \u0026 Bink, Drazin's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back in the back room is changed into Tag and Bink hiding and being discovered by the droid. They shot C-3PO as payback for him causing their capture years earlier on the Tantive IV.",
