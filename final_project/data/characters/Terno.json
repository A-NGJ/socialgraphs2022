 "content": "Terno was a Kitonak musician who lived during the Galactic Civil War. A vital member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the Minos Cluster, Terno led a Kitonak band in a traveling circus that was actually a front for the Alliance. Terno was the leader of the Alliance team, although publicly, Terno was merely the director of the band. They hired a tramp freighter to transport them from the planet Adarlon to the Yelsain, searching for information regarding the whereabouts of their leader, Drun Cairnwick, and attempting to reestablish a Rebel network.",
