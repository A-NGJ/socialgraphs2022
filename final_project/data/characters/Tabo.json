 "content": "Tabo was a Human male scientist and doctor employed at the Sundari Research Grounds on the planet Balmorra. Hoping to weaponize the Colicoids that the facility was studying, he sabotaged the facility's experiments tampering the suppressive implants and causing the Colicoids to break free and begin killing the staff. Tabo sealed the survivors in and fled to safety, though Galactic Republic forces discovered a recording from Doctor Arick Tamso that proved Tabo's guilt. Tabo tried to bribe the Republic forces to bring him the implants, but they refused.\nDoctor Tabo appears in the Heroic mission \"Colicoid Massacre\" for Republic players in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. If players choose the dark side option, they deliver the Colicoid implants to Tabo.",
