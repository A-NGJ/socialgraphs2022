 "content": "Pampy was a Rutian Twi'lek female who served as a loyal aide to Senator Orn Free Taa of the Galactic Republic's Senate. In 32 BBY, Pampy was present in the Senate Building when Queen Padmé Amidala of the planet Naboo called for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum.\nBy 22 BBY, Pampy was serving Taa alongside Supi, another aide of Taa with whom she had a bitter rivalry. The pair accompanied the senator his fellow members of the Loyalist Committee to a meeting in the office of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine during the Separatist Crisis.\nPampy was a Rutian Twi'lek female who served as an aide to Senator Orn Free Taa, the corrupt representative of the Twi'lek homeworld Ryloth in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. In 32 BBY, Pampy was on Coruscant, capital of the Republic, with Taa and attended a session of the Senate with him in which Queen Padmé Amidala of the planet Naboo asked for intervention in the invasion of her homeworld by the forces of the Trade Federation.\nInside the main chamber of the Senate Building, Pampy sat with another Twi'lek aide and Taa in a repulsorpod while the Trade Federation objected to the queen's claims and called for a committee to be formed in order to investigate the claim. When Amidala then called for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum due to his inability to aid her people, Pampy quickly stood as Taa and other senators rose and began to clamor about the vote. Pampy then lent in to listen to something being said by the other Twi'lek aide before Vice Chair Mas Amedda called for order.\nPampy was still serving as aide to Taa ten years later in 22 BBY while he was a member of the Loyalist Committee during the Separatist Crisis, in which numerous star systems began to defect from the Republic. She and Supi, another Twi'lek aide to Taa, accompanied the senator and other members of the committee, including Amidala and Senator Bail Organa, to a meeting with Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine and Amedda in the chancellor's office on Coruscant.\nAfter Palpatine's assistant Dar Wac alerted him to their arrival, the Chancellor had Pampy and the others sent into his office just as he was finishing up a meeting with the Jedi High Council. Before the committee could take their seats and start the meeting, Jedi Grand Master Yoda offered his condolences to Amidala after a recent attempt on her life, which prompted Palpatine to request additional Jedi security for Amidala. The Jedi consented to assigning Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect her and then left, after which the committee moved to take their seats.\nPampy served Taa loyally but had a bitter rivalry with Supi, vying with her for the senator's favor. She had cerulean skin and blue eyes.\nWhile in the Senate and when meeting with Palpatine, Pampy wore a silver dress and a piece of silver headwear with an embedded blue gem.\nPampy first appeared on the DVD release of the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. She and an additional Twi'lek aide were added to the Senate scene, replacing two human aides portrayed by Trisha Biggar and Iain McCaig that had appeared in the theatrical cut. While filming for the 2002 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the extra playing Pampy wore mitts between scenes in order to avoid spreading her makeup around.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, Pampy's name was identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where the character was first identified as Pampy in the 2001 novel Cloak of Deception by James Luceno.",
