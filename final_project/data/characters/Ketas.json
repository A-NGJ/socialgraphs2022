 "content": "Ketas was a Solodoe male who served as an ambassador for talks with the Plinovian species, held on Station Zeta, over the terraforming of Plin Minor. After his seal of office was stolen by the Jedi diplomat Arath Tarrex, Ketas blamed the Plinovian ambassador, who self-combusted and exploded from the accusation, nearly claiming the life of Ambassador Ketas as well. The latter, who was angered by the Plinovian's apparent theft of his seal, contacted Tanu, his Chief of Security, demanding to leave the station and declaring that he would continue the terraforming.",
