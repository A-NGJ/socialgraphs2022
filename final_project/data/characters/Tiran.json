 "content": "Tiran was a prestigious male Drall scientist who lived over ten thousand years before the founding of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY. Tiran developed the Theory of Universal Reference, which consisted of two facts which he proved: first, that time and space were unified, and second, that objects could not travel at the speed of light. Tiran gained galactic fame because of this discovery, though it was later proved that while objects could not travel at the speed of light, it was possible to bypass the light-speed barrier and travel faster than lightâ€”a discovery that allowed for the development of the hyperdrive.\nTiran was first mentioned in the 2004 novel MedStar I: Battle Surgeons, and has received mentions in numerous materials since then, including an entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which confirmed his gender.",
