 "content": "Kruss Gaal was an operative working on Darkside, a repair station in the Cularin system asteroid belt. He was also a member of The Cell, a criminal faction wanting to oust and replace local crime lord Nirama. He wasn't very highly placed in the Cell, neither was the Darkside faction in the general Cell scheme.\nGaal was one of the few remaining members of the Darkside contingent after a raid committed by Nirama's forces in 32 BBY. Other survivors included Ahlya, Dor Balse, Jarrilyn, Jasper and Michael. At that point, they were trying to recruit new members, including local Wookiees, Kaarl the Ithorian and some newcomers, but the people in Darkside felt no respect for the local Cell. Shortly thereafter, they were captured by a group of spies working for Nirama.\nHis implication in The Cell and subsequent capture were public knowledge less than one month later.",
