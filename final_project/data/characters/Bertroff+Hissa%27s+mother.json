 "content": "The mother of Bertroff Hissa, a Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire, was a Sephi woman. She and her husband were former political agitators who had chosen to settle on PL-40112-CE-021105, a barren planet of the Wild Space, to lead a \"simpler\" and \"more natural\" life. She was killed during a conflict that opposed the inhabitants of PL-40112-CE-021105 and the Imperials against the Rozzum.",
