 "content": "Wallaw Loowobbli was a male Ithorian naturalist who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, he stayed at the cantina in the Trade Outpost on the planet Dathomir. While here, he tasked a spacer with impeding the Imperial scientist Shibb Nisshil's plan to capture bull rancors and use them to create an an army of Imperial cyber-rancors. Fearing devastation to the planet's ecosystem, the spacer agreed to help Loowobbli by eliminating the hunting team and saving the rancor before it could be brought to Nisshil in the Research Outpost. The rancor, rendered as docile as a bolma caf due to an implanted mind-control chip, was ultimately saved, and brought back to Loowobbli. Loowobbli also tasked the spacer with eliminating a Nightsister who was banished from her clan. Out of anger, the Nightsister agreed to work with the Empire by aiding Nisshil in leading rancor hunting parties. Once again, the spacer succeeded.\nWallaw Loowobbli was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
