 "content": "Vlem Hill was a member of the Muun Hill family who worked for the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Decades before the Clone Wars, Hill quietly purchased the rights to an uninhabited planet in the Outer Rim Territories' Instrop sector from the Galactic Republic for industrial development. The world was designated P1S16IS0079 but would become known as Vlemoth Port. The Hill family then capped undersea volcanos with mine-spires to filter precious metals and built the city of Sanshur Flats to produce missiles for the Banking Clan's IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks.\nVlem Hill was mentioned in Friends Like These, a 2015 adventure book written by Keith Kappel and Ryan K. Brooks for Fantasy Flight Games's Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game.",
