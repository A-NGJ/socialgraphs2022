 "content": "Teven Liss'ard was a Human lieutenant in Black Sun during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.\nTeven Liss'ard was a male Human who was part of the Black Sun gang on Coruscant during the Cold War. He held a high position in the Coruscant branch of the gang, and he commanded the Black Sun forces that were hijacking freighters from the Finaq Shipping Company. Teven was killed by a traveling hero who had also destroyed Teven's hijacking operations, eliminating enough of the Black Sun thugs to stop the hijacking.\nTeven Liss'ard appears in the BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the Coruscant mission \"Freightskipping Fracas\". He is the target of the third and final stage of the mission, which is a bonus mission in Black Sun territory.",
