 "content": "Kelon was the Chief Directory Assistant of the Woostri HoloScan Database, a library located on the planet Woostri. He had a Borg Construct Aj^6 cybernetic headband, which he used to access information for his work. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, following the Battle of Yavin, Kelon assisted an individual who requested information on citizens of the planets Tatooine and Bespin with respective sub.refs to the planets' cities of Mos Eisley and Cloud City.\nAfter accessing his database, finding and displaying those results, Kelon asked if the individual wanted to narrow the search before he was given new search parameters to link existing matches to known movements of the Heroes of Yavin. Kelon followed through with the search and went on to access and display those results as well. A Human, Kelon had fair skin, green eyes, and black eyebrows with a black goatee. He wore a gray-and-black jumpsuit with a belt and black boots.\nKelon was created in 1997's Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition, a supplement for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.",
