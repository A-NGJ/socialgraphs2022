 "content": "Jain Havero was a male Calian warrior and a comrade of powerful warlord Aron Peacebringer on the remote planet Shiva IV during the era of the Galactic Civil War. A boastful young man, Havero ranked among the best fighters on Shiva IV by 3 ABY, although he had such prowess in battle that he sometimes became careless. In 3 ABY Havero—while investigating the fate of the city of K'avor with Peacebringer, Kéral Longknife and Ygal Delois—discovered a group of outcast cutthroats menacing Leia Organa, a Rebel leader who had crash-landed on Shiva IV. Havero and his fellows fought the bandits off and rescued Organa, who amazed Havero, who had seen precious few offworlders in his life.\nHavero first appeared in Star Wars 53: The Last Gift from Alderaan, written by Chris Claremont and released in 1981.",
