 "content": "Preela Dorat was the daughter of the Imperial Admiral Chel Dorat. Her mother died when Preela was very young, and her father was often away on naval business, so Preela was raised by the family's servants and nanny droids.\nShe was spoiled and bullied those under her social status and was pleasant and charming towards powerful and influential people. She was fiercely loyal to the Galactic Empire, and when her father decided to defect to the Rebel Alliance, she, hoping to win the family fortune and gaining favor with the Emperor, turned him in and joined forces with the Imperial Security Bureau in an attempt to capture him.\nShe was a Human female and had dark red hair which was typically arranged in elaborate styles. She also wore very expensive and stylish clothes.",
