 "content": "A Mizi male individual lived during the High Republic Era, serving on a Mizi starship that carried cargo. The Mizi's vessel was one of several that were left stranded in a star system after the Great Hyperspace Disaster led to the closure of hyperspace routes. In order to take refuge from a solar flare, the starships stranded in the system were forced to board a nearby abandoned space station. The Mizi group and multiple other parties initially attempted to loot the space station and were uncooperative, but tensions were eventually eased.\nSeveral days into his time on the station, the Mizi volunteered to join an expedition to the station's lower rings alongside the Jedi Dez Rydan and Reath Silas, the copilot Affie Hollow, and the young girl Nan, wishing for his people to receive a share of anything that was found on the lower level. As the group climbed down the tunnel to the lower rings, the Mizi was in a hurry to descend, cutting away the vines that had grown throughout the station. The group were forced to retreat when the station's 8-T gardening model droids attempted to attack them, seeing them as a threat to their plants. Shortly afterward, a second attempt was undertaken by the party, including the Mizi. Silas suggested that they carry plants with them as they climbed, leading the 8-Ts to let them pass so as not to risk damage to the plants. Upon reaching the lower ring, the group split up to search the level. However, when Rydan was thought to have died due to malfunctioning helix rings, the other members of the group returned, and the Mizi rushed back to his people. Shortly afterward, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh announced that limited hyperspace travel was allowed, permitting those stranded aboard the station to leave.",
