 "content": "This Clone Captain was a clone trooper captain who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The clone participated in the First Battle of Geonosis alongside Jedi Grand Master Yoda and was present in the forward command center during the battle. He ordered all quadrants to move to sector 5-1-5 after receiving orders from Master Yoda.\nThis Clone Captain was part of an army of clone troopers that were grown from the genetic template of the bounty hunter Jango Fett on Kamino. With the formation of the Grand Army of the Republic at the onset of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the captain participated in the First Battle of Geonosis where he was stationed in a forward command center along with a Clone Commander and Jedi Grand Master Yoda. Yoda ordered all fire be concentrated on the nearest starship, so the captain ordered all quadrants to sector 5-1-5. Following this, the Galactic Republic's SPHA-Ts fired on a core ship.\nThis clone trooper captain wore Phase I clone trooper armor with red markings to signify his rank.",
