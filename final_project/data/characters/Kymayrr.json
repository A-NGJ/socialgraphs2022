 "content": "Kymayrr was a female Wookiee living in Kachirho on the planet Kashyyyk. In 1 ABY, her son Rroot was captured by a group of Trandoshan slavers known as the Blackscale Clan. She hired a spacer to travel to their camp in the Rryatt Trail and rescue him.\nKymayrr is one of the many residents of Kashyyyk added to Star Wars Galaxies through its 2005 expansion pack Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees.\nKymayrr was originally a dancer in the cantina on one of the levels of the great wroshyr tree in Kachirho, and her name reflected such in brackets . Unfortunately, she would constantly fall through the floor of the cantina, winding up on the ground level of Kachirho, inaccessible to players. Instead of constant game master intervention or server resets to place her back in the cantina, the developers simply moved her down to ground level and removed any mention of her being a dancer at the cantina.",
