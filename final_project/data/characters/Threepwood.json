 "content": "\"Threepwood\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He along with his fellow clones Tracker and Boil and the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker took part in a manhunt on the planet Christophsis for the two Sith fugitives Count Dooku and Quinlan Vos, who had escaped Republic custody. Threepwood and his comrades examined the crash site where Dooku and Vos' commandeered ship Banshee had crash-landed. The clones and Jedi determined that the fugitives had survived but at least one of them was hurt. Their pursuit culminated in the events of the second battle of Christophsis.\nPrior to the release of the novel Dark Disciple, Threepwood was the name of a clone trooper seen in the Nintendo DS version of Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes.",
