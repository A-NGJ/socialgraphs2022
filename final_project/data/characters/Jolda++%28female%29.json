 "content": "Jolda was a female Human who was a sergeant in the Imperial Army of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War and Galactic War against the Galactic Republic, when she was stationed on Vaiken Spacedock.\nSergeant Jolda appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as the Dromund Kaas Equipment Commendations vendor on Vaiken Spacedock, though she was later relabeled as the Level 13 Equipment Vendor. She is identical to the Dromund Kaas Modifications Commendations vendor, Sergeant Kidles, and two male vendors in the area also named Sergeant Kidles and Sergeant Jolda. The female Sergeant Jolda was later removed from the game along with the rest of the planetary Equipment Commendations vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; that update also replaced Sergeant Kidles with a new character, Sergeant Kanzin.",
