 "content": "Kasuni Tamm was a female Togruta who was an adventurer. Unbeknownst to her, she was Force-sensitive. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, she and her pet bogwing, Vaxim, became involved in the search for a Holocron at the Well of Shadows. She met other Force-sensitives and was pursued by Sor Venge, an Inquisitor who was also searching for holocron. However, she was able to flee with the others.\nTamm appears in the introductory story and gameplay example for Fantasy Flight Games' roleplaying game book Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook.",
