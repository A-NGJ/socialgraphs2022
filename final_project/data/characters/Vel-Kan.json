 "content": "Vel-Kan was a male Human criminal, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nVel-Kan was the brother of the pirate Dorel-Kan. He was a skilled forgery expert and eventually saved up enough money to establish himself as a criminal. He operated in the city of Hedrett on Cularin and employed the Trandoshan Kisskk as a bodyguard. He was present in Hedrett in the bar Spanner's, when the heroes of Cularin visited it in about 31 BBY.\nVel-Kan treated his associates with respect and wasn't overly violent or corrupt. He was prepared to deal fairly with people, but was prepared to use violence if someone disrespected or took advantage of him. He had good reflexes and a careful eye for detail.",
