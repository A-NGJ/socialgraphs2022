 "content": "Danlea Lochner, also known as Tara Warren, was an agent of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nTara Warren was the daughter of Morellian scoutmaster Barosa Warren and an unidentified mother. She was on bad terms with her father, especially since Tara joined the Rebel Alliance, opposing Barosa's wishes. Angry at Barosa, Tara even changed her legal name.\nTara Warren's siblings were Roland Warren, Tole Warren, Alton Lochner . All of them were half-Morellian and probably came from different mothers, and they all eventually joined the Rebel Alliance.\nDanlea Lochner was a contact for the Alliance smuggling operations along the Ison Corridor.",
