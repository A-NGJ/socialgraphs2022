 "content": "Baboo was a Human male who lived on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he worked at the Lucky Despot, a cantina owned by the criminal leader Lady Valarian in Mos Eisley.\nBaboo was a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Baboo was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. Unlike most Humans in the game, Baboo had a facial tattoo.\nBaboo was intended to be part of the cancelled Valarian Themepark. This questline was initially planned to be introduced in the game with the \"Publish 23\" to replace the original \"Valarian Quest Series.\" Although the old \"Valarian Quest Series\" was deactivated with the release of Publish 23 on August 31, 2005, the new Themepark was never activated. NPCs of the Valarian Theme Park such as Baboo were implemented into the game but they were not involved in any quest.",
