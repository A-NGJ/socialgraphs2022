 "content": "A male human student attended a school on the planet Nevarro, where his cookies was once stolen by the Mandalorian foundling Grogu.\nA young male student was attending a class on astrography when the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his entourage left his foundling, Grogu, in the school, seating him beside the student. The student was snacking on a packet of blue cookies, which Grogu took an interest in, seemingly requesting that the student share. After refusing to share some, the student found that the entirety of his snack had been stolen by Grogu, who began to eat a cookie. The foundling took the sleeve of remaining cookies with him when Djarin returned for him sometime later.\nThe student first appeared in \"Chapter 12: The Siege,\" the fourth episode of the second season of the television series The Mandalorian, which aired on Disney+ on November 20, 2020. He was played by Daniel Negrete and credited as \"School Kid.\"",
