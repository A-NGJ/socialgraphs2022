 "content": "Setongah was a male Dug who was a member of Sebolto's clan as of 32 BBY. He was wanted by the Pixelito Grand Council for peddling death sticks to Gran youth. His bounty was claimed by Jango Fett.\nSetongah is, according to the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, supposed to be the third bounty Jango encounters in the twelfth mission, \"The Death Stick Factory\", but in his place instead is Maree Yad. This is evidently one of the handful of mistakes made by the Official Strategy Guide, as Setongah has the description of Maree, with Maree additionally appearing in place of where the Official Strategy Guide claims Setongah is.",
