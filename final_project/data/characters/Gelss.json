 "content": "Gelss was a Sullustan smuggler and pirate who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nSome years after the conclusion of the Great Galactic War with the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, Fekk served under smuggler Captain Jet Nebula in Nebula's starship, the Auriga Fire. During the Cold War, Gelss and another Sullustan, Fekk, became affiliated with Nebula's First Mate, Shinqo. Shinqo planned a mutiny against Nebula and executed it when the Auriga Fire intercepted the Cinzia. Holding Nebula at blasterpoint, Shinqo urged the Captain to contact the Cinzia, and Nebula revealed to the Cinzia's crew that they planned to board the ship. Shinqo ordered Gelss and Fekk to prepare for action, but the Cinzia self-destructed. Taking advantage of the confusion, Nebula's droid, Clunker, grabbed Shinqo and took his blaster, pointing it at the mutineer. With the Auriga Fire back under Nebula's control, the mutineers accepted their positions under Nebula and the crew picked up some debris from the Cinzia's wreckageâ€”a navicomp and a hex droid nest.",
