 "content": "Kandhar was a Devaronian male pirate who led a faction of the White Maw, a pirate gang based on Hoth. During the Battle of Hoth at the start of the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, he allied with the Empire in an attempt to take over the White Maw.\nThe Devaronian male Kandhar was a member of the White Maw, a pirate gang based on the ice planet Hoth. By the year 3642 BBY, he led his own group in the White Maw, and was the rival of the Weequay Shai Tenna, another White Maw pirate. By that year, Kandhar had made an alliance with the reconstituted Sith Empire. In return for their help in ousting the White Maw's Gen'Dai leaders, Kandhar and his men would work for the Empire. Through his alliance with the Empire, Kandhar also received cold-weather droids, which pleased the Gen'Dai, and angered Shai Tenna.\nIn 3642 BBY, Kandhar and some of his men—Risold, Feldon, and Halrii—met with Imperial commander Tarkus in the Tromper Crags mineral mine on Hoth. Tarkus informed him that the Imperial admiral known as the Voidwolf had agreed to the terms of the deal. However, the meeting was interrupted by a Republic smuggler sent by Shai Tenna. The smuggler revealed to Khandar's pirates that his deal would bring them under the Empire's control, and they revolted. In the ensuing skirmish, Kandhar and the Imperials were killed.",
