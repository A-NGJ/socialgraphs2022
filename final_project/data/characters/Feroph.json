 "content": "Feroph was an Imperial TIE/rp Reaper attack lander pilot during the Galactic Civil War who held the rank of captain. Feroph had been involved at the Mission to Eadu, flying through the planet's turbulent storms as the Alliance to Restore the Republic attacked the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory.\nCaptain Feroph is a character in the TIE Reaper Expansion Pack of Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game by Fantasy Flight Games. According to the artist for his card, Anthony Devine, the image depicting the character originally depicted Feroph simply flying away from the exploding Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory, but it had been deemed too boring, so he added in various TIEs and X-Wings dogfighting and resubmitted it, citing it changed the overall story slightly.",
