 "content": "Carshotta was a female Togruta who performed in Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder carnival act, alongside another Togruta performer. Her skin was rusty violet and a yellow circle with a maroon centre was on her forehead. Curved over the top of the circle was a thin line.\nWhile entertaining pirates on Florrum, the Jedi younglings Katooni, Petro, Byph, Gungi and Zatt entered the carnival in the hopes of rescuing Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and they succeeded. Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang attacked the carnival show in retaliation, but all of the performers escaped.\nBeing a circus performer, Carshotta was deft and capable of doing stunts or tricks that other beings wouldn't be able to accomplish - like the time when she could balance Convorees on both arms without having them slip off. Carshotta was also proud of herself and wasn't afraid to voice her own opinion. In many scenes of Bound for Rescue, Carshotta stood tall with her hands on her hips and a smirk on her face. Her ego would have been rather sizeable.\nCarshotta's close-fitting attire was a dull, grey color and exposed parts of her legs. She wore long gloves—that were the same dull grey—that reached her biceps. Carshotta also wore white boots that were long enough to touch her knees. Occasionally, a slender, loose ornament was draped over her Montrals, looping around and curving underneath her chin.",
