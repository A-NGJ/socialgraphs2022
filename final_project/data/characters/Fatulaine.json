 "content": "Fatulaine was a male human who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire. At some point in his service, he was promoted to oversee activities in the Chroman Labor Pits; three days into his position, Fatulaine secretly began to free prisoners. He continued to counter Imperial actions, and during the Iron Blockade, he joined the crew of a young smuggler.\nCaptain Fatulaine first appeared in Star Wars canon in the multiplayer mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, created by the Kabam company and released on September 10, 2015 for iOS and Android platforms. Within the scope of the game, Fatulaine acts as a potential crewmate for the player character, able to be tasked with carrying out timed quests to recover valuable experience points and loot.",
