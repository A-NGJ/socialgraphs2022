 "content": "Smasher was a mimph who lived on the Forest Moon of Endor. In 3 ABY, Smasher and two other mimphs, led by a fourth, Masher, captured the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick, with Smasher helping by tightening the ropes used to detain him. The group then brought Warrick back to their village, where they presented the Ewok to the rest of the mimphs, who were all very impressed.\nThe mimphs released Warrick after he defeated a hanadak that threatened the mimph village, and Smasher was later present when the mimphs bid him farewell. Smasher had pink-and-white hair, black eyes, and wore orange clothing with a yellow belt.\nSmasher appeared in \"Gone With the Mimphs,\" the sixth episode of the second season of the animated series Ewoks. The episode was written by Linda Woolverton and aired on October 18, 1986. \"Gone With the Mimphs\" does not specify which of the four mimphs of the capturing party is Smasher.",
