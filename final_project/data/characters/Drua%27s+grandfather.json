 "content": "The grandfather of Drua was a male Twi'lek native of the planet Ryloth. He lived in an isolated village with his granddaughter, during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Drua's grandfather took responsibility for Drua after her mother died. While he was elderly and blind, he was a very welcoming and friendly to those whom he did not know.\nFollowing the rebellious actions of Free Ryloth Movement, Drua's grandfather joined the rest of his village in welcoming Darth Vader, Emperor Sheev Palpatine, and Sergeant Erstin Deez into their village, unaware of their identities. When a small conflict between Twi'lek rebels, led by Cham Syndulla, broke out in the village, Drua's grandfather retreated to a series of caves with the rest of the villagers.\nAfter the conflict ended and the rebels had been thwarted, the Emperor commanded Darth Vader to kill Drua's grandfather and the other villagers, including Drua, as he wanted no living witnesses to what had transpired.",
