 "content": "Andar Suquand was an ancient male Ithorian revolutionary who was known for the subtle ways in which he affected social and political change. His actions became known as \"casting sand in the gears of the machine,\" since they caused great damage and instituted great change over a period of time. Separatist spy Klo Merit thought of Suquand's strategies before bombing a Galactic Republic MedStar-class frigate in 20 BBY.\nSuquand was briefly mentioned in MedStar II: Jedi Healer, the second novel of the MedStar Duology. Jedi Healer was written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry and published in 2004.",
