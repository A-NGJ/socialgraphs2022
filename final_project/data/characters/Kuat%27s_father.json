 "content": "Kuat's father held the position of Kuat of Kuat in the period in between Onara Kuat and his own son, Kuat of Kuat.\nAlthough Kuat's father's reign as head of the Kuat family and the Kuat Drive Yards appears to have been short, his words of advice were noted by his son during the latter's reign.\nThe man kept a low profile throughout his career, as Kuat of Kuat became a notable and influential Kuati even prior to his father's reign, opposing his aunt Onara when she attempted to have Senator Giddean Danu ousted from office.",
