 "content": "Mellor Yago was an officer in the Rendili Home Defense Fleet during the Clone Wars, serving aboard the flagship Mersel Kebir.\nLieutenant Yago felt that that Rendili would be better off if it left the Galactic Republic and took its powerful fleet to the Confederacy of Independent Systemsâ€”with him in command. Yago was personally responsible for leading the mutiny that captured Rendili fleet commander Captain Jace Dallin, Jedi Master Plo Koon, and Republic Captain Jan Dodonna. He then took command of the fleet and used it to attack the Republic forces with the aid of his Confederacy reinforcements.\nHowever, the prisoners were freed by Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos. Jace Dallin personally killed Yago and took control of the fleet again, ending the mutiny.",
