 "content": "Injaye was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3640 BBY, she was one of the many Jedi Masters that were sent to Corellia to help the people during the Battle of Corellia. However, Injaye secretly acted as a spy to the Sith Lord Darth Baras of the resurgent Sith Empire, having infiltrated the Jedi Order a decade before. When Baras started his plot to usurp the position of the Voice of the Emperor, the loyalist Sith of the Emperor's Hand sent the new Emperor Wrath to assist Darth Vowrawn, who suggested eliminating all of Baras' agents on Corellia. Eventually, the Wrath and their allies discovered the true loyalty of Injaye from Vowrawn's operative Shadow and set out to confront her. Injaye fought alongside Masters Rubatin and Joce to defeat the Wrath, but her allies all defeated. After watching Rubatin and Joce die, Injaye revealed herself to the Wrath as a spy. She knew that Darth Baras would proclaim himself as the Voice for the Emperor and slowly died from her wounds.\nDepending on player choice, Injaye's ultimate fate within the game can change. When confronting the Jedi, the player can expose Injaye as a Sith spy either by tricking her into believing the Wrath is there to wipe out the Jedi, or by getting Jaesa Willsaam, one of the Wrath's companions, to sense the alignments and feelings of everyone in the room. Either way, they may then kill her and leave, let the Jedi take her into their custody, or proceed to kill both her and the rest of the Jedi anyway.",
