 "content": "A Mimbanese male doctor served the Unbroken Clan criminal syndicate during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the doctor accompanied General Vukorah and a soldier to an Unbroken Clan safe house on the planet Corellia after Vukorah was wounded by Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra and Sana Starros during a failed attempt to claim a Nihil hyperdrive. The doctor was concerned about a blaster wound Vukorah had and informed the general that it should be treated, though she insisted that she was fine. As the trio made their way to the entrance of the safe house, the soldier noted that it was open and that they would check it out before being killed by the Crimson Dawn assassin Deathstick, who had broken into the safe house. The doctor and Vukorah then made their way into the safe house where they were greeted by Deathstick. Vukorah deemed the situation unacceptable and killed the doctor. The assassin questioned Vukorah as to why she had killed an underling, with Vukorah responding that the doctor had been the one to suggest the safe house which left her with two conclusions, either that he had sold her out or that he was \"utterly incompetent,\" neither of which she would tolerate.",
