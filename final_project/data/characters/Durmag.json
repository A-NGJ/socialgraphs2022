 "content": "Durmag was a force-pike-wielding Gamorrean mercenary. He worked as muscle on Socorro for the Twi'lek gangster Abdi-Badawzi before he was traded to Ploovo Two-For-One for a previous favor and became a member of Ploovo's Protocol Team. Although he enjoyed working for Abdi-Badawzi, he did not mind the move, because it meant a greater chance of physical action against people that owed Ploovo.",
