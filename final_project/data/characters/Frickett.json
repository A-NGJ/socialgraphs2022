 "content": "Commander Frickett was an officer in the Imperial Army.\nFrickett was an officer who seemed to have an inflated sense of self-importance which he passed on to Captain Gage. Stationed on Maridun after the Battle of Yavin, he despised Janek Sunber's association with lower ranks and Sunber's ability to work alongside them.\nDuring the Battle of Maridun, he foolishly ordered an attack on massed Amanin forces, not realizing that it was a trap. Frickett was killed along with most of his men, when they were outflanked by the better organized Amanin.",
