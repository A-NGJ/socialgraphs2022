 "content": "Sisseri Deo was a male Firrerreo Padawan serving the Jedi Order during the final days of the Galactic Republic. Stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple during the latter stages of the Clone Wars, Deo participated in the Jedi Temple Apprentice Tournament in 19 BBY.\nDiscovered to be Force-sensitive, Sisseri Deo was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple by a member of the Acquisition Division for training in the Jedi arts. At the academy there, Deo studied in a clan until he graduated from the academy and became eligible to become an apprentice to a Jedi Master.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Deo was still stationed at the Temple and participated in the 19 BBY Jedi Temple Apprentice Tournament. Administrated by Master Ilena Xan, Deo successfully won in the first and second rounds of the competition, defeating Forzi Ghul, but was ultimately eliminated after losing to Padawan Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy after she blinded him with a cup of muja juice.",
