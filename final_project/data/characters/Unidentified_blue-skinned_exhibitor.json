 "content": "A blue-skinned exhibitor was the first sentient to ever display an ysalamir at the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition, at some point at the height of the New Republic. During the exhibit, he wore his rare pet wrapped around his shoulders like a shawl, and his likeness got captured on the spot by the zoologist Lyrre T'enna, who was drawing illustrations for her annotated field guide. As shown on T'enna's colored drawing, the exhibitor was a blue-skinned humanoid with pointy ears and yellow eyes. He had unkempt, disheveled hair and sported facial tattoos.\nAlthough that individual's species was never identified in The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide, most of his facial features match those of the Pantorans seen in the TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. He did, however, sport tapered ears, a trait that Pantorans lack. Leland Chee, keeper of the Holocron continuity database, once shared his personal theory that \"all pointy-eared species are either Sephi or closely related to Sephi,\" a reference to a species from the 2004 comic story Jedi: Yoda.",
