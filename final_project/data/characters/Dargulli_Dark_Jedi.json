 "content": "The Dargulli Dark Jedi was a Human female Dark Jedi who lived during the Great Jedi Purge.\nSeveral weeks before the Battle of Yavin, she was on the planet Dargulli, where she killed stormtroopers sent to collect taxes, hoping to attract the attention of Darth Vader. She had foreseen that Vader would kill Palpatine, and sensed that he could bring order to the Force and rule the galaxy. She also could sense that Vader was missing something in his life. To this end, she wished to become his Sith apprentice. Vader, although tempted, killed her after only a moment's hesitation.\nThough her lightsaber appeared to resemble that of a Jedi and thus lacked a traditional dark side crystal, she claimed not to be one, and Vader sensed no Jedi teachings in her, leaving her origins a mystery.\nSidirri was intended to be a younger version of this character.",
