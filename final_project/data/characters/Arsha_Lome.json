 "content": "Arsha Lome was a female human who worked as a lawyer representing Samovar's mining conglomerate. During his time as a Adjutant General, Wilhuff Tarkin knew Lome and claimed she had as sharp a legal mind as he'd ever encountered. Shortly after an operation carried out by a group of smugglers at Samovar, Lome contacted Tarkin via hologram claiming her clients had no involvement in the arm shipment that the Galactic Empire discovered, Tarkin however dismissed this and claimed that the truth would eventually come out and that Lome's clients would have a day in court.",
