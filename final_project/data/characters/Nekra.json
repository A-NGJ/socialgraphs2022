 "content": "Nekra, also known as Nekra the Warlord, was a male Geonosian residing in the Mendacious Oasis on Tatooine around 3643 BBY, when he was killed.\nNekra appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Tatooine. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
