 "content": "Commander Fenris was an officer in the Rebel Alliance.\nFenris once led a briefing detailing Luke Skywalker's attack on Admiral Kohrin's fleet and flagship, Enforcer. Though he was not at the actual briefing , his presence seemed to fill the hall, anyway, from his projection in the holotank. After the briefing, he led a second attack on the Enforcer while it was being repaired at Phaylenn. His attack was extremely successful, not only destroying the Enforcer but the shipyards it was being repaired in also.",
