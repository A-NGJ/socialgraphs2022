 "content": "Commander Bragan was a male Human soldier who served in the Republic army during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Ord Mantell where he battled against the Separatist forces. However, he and his men were pinned down by the separatists that were able to take control over Mannett Point. With the Separatists in control of the Point, the weapons had been turned against the Republic soldiers in the area. He later tasked a Republic spacer to take those weapons out of the separatists' hands.\nCommander Bragan appears as a mission-giver in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic on Ord Mantell. According to the game's text files, Bragan was originally named Brannigan.",
