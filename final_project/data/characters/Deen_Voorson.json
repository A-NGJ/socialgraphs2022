 "content": "Deen Voorson was a Human male Rebel Alliance technician who helped in the evacuation of Hoth and was a friend of Voren Na'al. While on Hoth, he was one of the technicians who converted the T-47 airspeeders to the cold. When he returned home to Kuat, he asked his aunt Nell Voorson to allow him and the Rebel Alliance to steal power generators, something she refused to do. When he learned that someone had arranged for the Rebellion to steal the generators, he believed his aunt had a change of heart, but was instead surprised to find it was orchestrated by his nine-year-old cousin Shannon Voorson, who joined him and Boo Rawl and defected to the Rebel Alliance.",
