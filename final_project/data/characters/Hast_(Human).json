 "content": "Hast was a Human male who served with both the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nHast, a Human male, attended the Imperial Academy before serving as a Pit Lieutenant aboard the Valiant under Captain Oweg and Moff Vensell. Hast later resigned his commission at the end of his tour, and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Assigned to Ordnance and Supply, he served as a Special Agent under Ral'Rai Muvunc, observing privateer starships used by the Alliance.\nAfter three years, Hast was posted to the privateer starship Free Lance commanded by Captain Urias Xhaxin as an Alliance observer. The two men did not get along well, and Hast's tour of observation was marked by almost perpetual argument, with Hast second guessing the captain.",
