 "content": "Bovo Yagen was a former Imperial captain who fled the Empire with his wife and four sons. After a period of wandering, the family landed on a planet with a humanoid species. Proving their good intentions to the natives, the family was allowed to settle on the world. Over time, more Humans fleeing the Empire arrived, forming a small outpost. By the time Yagen passed away, the planet bore his name.",
