 "content": "Sartar was an Imperial Moff who directed the development of Fire-Rain 3, a deadly bio-agent. The chemical weapon was developed at supply depot I-389, located on Tatooine, sometime after the Battle of Yavin. Sartar had planned to test his new weapon on the inhabitants of Anchorhead and Mos Eisley, but was foiled when a team of Rebel Alliance agents managed to destroy all samples of the bio-agent, along with Sartar's laboratory.\nSartar was also one of the few Humans who could speak Ithorese.",
