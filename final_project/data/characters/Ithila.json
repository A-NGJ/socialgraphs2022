 "content": "Ithila was Hapan woman of middle age who was lean and beautiful except for a pattern of burn scars on the right side of her face she suffered as a result of an explosion on board a Hapan Battle Dragon she served on during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Her scars were due to an allergic reaction to bacta, keeping her from recovering fully and forcing her into a self-imposed exilement from the Hapes Consortium. She would go on to become a mercenary and serve on board the Poison Moon as a sensor officer and served under Dician who, unbeknownst to her, was a Sith.",
