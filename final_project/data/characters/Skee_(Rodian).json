 "content": "Skee was a portly Rodian who was a member of the Tetsu Clan.\nIn 17 BBY, Skee and his family fled their native world during the Rodian Clan Wars to start a new life for themselves on an U-Tendik. Skee discovered a predatory species of animal known as a Manka cat and became a prosperous Manka Cat hunter. He particularly enjoyed hunting them late in the year during mating season and would hang Manka pelts from the limbs of the Tendril trees as a testament to his skill.\nIn 4 BBY, raiders from Navik the Red's Chattza Clan found the Tetsus on the jungle planet and began slaughtering them. As they escaped Skee warned the others that everyone behind him was dead as the clan boarded their secret ships.",
