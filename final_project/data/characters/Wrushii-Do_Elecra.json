 "content": "Wrushii-Do Elecra was a gray-skinned Aki-Aki who lived on the desert planet Pasaana. As an adult in 35 ABY, Elecra attended the Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley. As a group of Resistance agents arrived at the edge of the festival, Elecra was dancing with another Aki-Aki next to a burning brazier and threw an ancestral Aki-Aki effigy, into the flames.\nWrushii-Do Elecra first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
