 "content": "DD was the nickname of a male Human clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. He was created by the Kaminoan cloners on the planet Kamino for use in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. Trained as a clone commando, he was made a member of RC-1309's squad, serving alongside fellow commandos RC-1304 \"O-Four\" and Sev under sergeant Niner. The squad was deployed to the planet Geonosis during the first battle of the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the fight DD, O-Four and Sev were all killed, leaving Niner as the only member of the squad. The sergeant later wished he had held DD and Sev back during the battle. Like all clone troopers, DD was 1.83 meters tall.\nDD was first mentioned in Republic Commando: Hard Contact a 2004 novel written by Karen Traviss. He later received mention in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, another book in the same series.",
