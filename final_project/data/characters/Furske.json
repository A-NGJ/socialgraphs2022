 "content": "Furske was a male Kajain'sa'Nikto who served as a captain in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.\nBy 137 ABY, Furske was stationed aboard the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer\nAvenger. Assigned to the Coruscant Third Fleet, the Avenger was tasked with protecting the planet Ralltiir, when the Galactic Alliance Remnant and the Empire-in-exile launched a surprise attack on the the fleet, intending to seize as many Imperial ships as possible. After the initial strike by the Gar Stazi's fleet, Furske reported to Admiral Peto Kelsan that the fleet's ships sustained some damage, but have already raised their shields and were returning fire. But when the Bastion Second Fleet, under the command of Admiral Edouard Fenel, arrived to reinforce Stazi, Furske quickly calculated that his side was badly outnumbered. Fenel demanded from Kelsan's men surrender their ships, but Kelsan instead ordered his men to set their ships for self-destruct and then leave them in the escape pods. Peto Kelsan himself choose to stay on the Avenger and perished with his fleet.",
