 "content": "Twitch was a male Rodian who was the only alien duelist in the Taris dueling ring at the time of the destruction of Taris. He was thought to be mentally unstable, but it did not stop him from becoming the dueling champion of Taris after he defeated the former champion, Marl. His psychotic personality led to several exciting matches, and his popularity soared, but it still paled in comparison to that of Bendak Starkiller.\nTwitch was a male, Rodian duelist who competed on the city world of Taris in the Upper City's Taris dueling ring owned by Ajuur the Hutt. By 3956 BBY, before the destruction of the Endar Spire by a Sith fleet led by the Sith Lord Darth Malak, he had become the dueling champion of Taris, having claimed the position after defeating the former champion, a veteran Human duelist named Marl.\nIn 3956 BBY, the amnesiac Revan used the alias of \"The Mysterious Stranger\" in the dueling ring to earn credits while searching for the Jedi Bastila Shan on the Taris. After defeating the lesser duelists, Deadeye Duncan, Gerlon Two-Fingers, Ice, and Marl, the former champion, Revan defeated Twitch to become the dueling champion of Taris.\nTwitch was spontaneous and dynamic in his mannerisms, but was not always one for lucid conversations. Because of his nonsensical speech and eccentric behavior, he was widely regarded by the public as mentally unhinged. Despite, or perhaps because of this, many of his audience were thrilled by his wild, unpredictable style and rapid reflexes with his blasters. As a new and younger champion, replacing the elderly Marl, Twitch was respected for his expert performance, crazy or not. Even so, he was not as skilled as Bendak Starkiller, the legendary former champion who only fought death matches, and Gerlon Two-Fingers thought that not even Twitch was insane enough to challenge Bendak.\nTwitch favored two heavy blaster pistols as his chosen weapons in the Taris dueling ring. Like the other duelists, he reserved a vibroblade as a side-arm in the event an opponent with a melee weapon managed to close the gap to him.\nTwitch first appeared in BioWare's video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game as a non-player character. In the Taris dueling ring, he serves as the fifth combatant in the dueling ring for the player, with only Bendak Starkiller left for the player to duel in an illegal death match, which gives the player dark side points.",
