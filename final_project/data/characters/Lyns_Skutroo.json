 "content": "Lyns Skutroo was a Verpine master crafter who lived in the years following the Waymancy Storm, a conflict waged in 7811 BBY between the Galactic Republic and the Signatories of Waymancy. In the 7700s BBY, Skutroo unveiled the squintpipe process, a methodology for improving the power generators used aboard starships.\nThe squintpipe process was the culmination of work initiated during the Waymancy Storm by Republic technologists at an Axum shipyard to reverse-engineer the Sif-Alulan process, which had been used by the Sisters of the Machinesmith to develop the advanced military technology of the Signatories of Waymancy. The creation of the squintpipe process by Skutroo led to an improvement in energy weaponry and later on to a golden age in warship construction across the galaxy.\nLyns Skutroo was introduced in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare, authored by Jason Fry and Paul R. Urquhart.",
