 "content": "Narra Mesyne was a Sector Rangers Special Enforcement Officer active during the Galactic Civil War. While tracking down a known criminal she assumed the alias of Miraj in order to get closer to her target.\nNarra was given the assignment to apprehend notorious criminal Kaylo NaKuda. In order to get close to her quarry she assumed the alias of Miraj, an up-and-coming racer who rapidly became famous in The Pit, a swoop racerâ€“oriented cantina located on Stend VI. NaKuda owned a garage next to The Pit which Narra hoped to get closer to by rising through the ranks of swoop racers.\nNarra was very shrewd and used the blatant sexism within the swoop racing culture against her opponents. Her favorite tactic was to let her opponents think that victory would be theirs before she would accelerate past them at the last moment. While racing she would wear a tinted racing helmet, so her opponents would be quite shocked after losing a race to her for her to reveal that she was actually a beautiful woman. She had long dark hair with lighter highlighted bangs. In addition she often wore large earrings.\nAs a swoop racer Narra was skilled but not exceptional compared to other swoop racers on the track. As a Sector Ranger she was highly skilled at espionage and investigations as well as law enforcement tactics and intimidation.\nIn combat she was skilled with both blasters and melee; however, she was only average at hand-to-hand combat.\nAs Miraj, Narra rode a modified Aratech 74-Z speeder bike that was painted white and silver which she called Wraith.\nShe carried a blaster pistol and wore camo scout armor that helped her move about unseen if she desired.\nNara Mesyne, also known as Miraj, was designed by Paul Danner and Bill Smith for Wretched Hives of Scum \u0026 Villainy, a supplement for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1997.\nNara Mesyne was designed as either a potential ally or enemy for the players depending on whether the players wanted to bring Kaylo NaKuda and his slaving empire or were hired by NaKuda to discover who had been attempting to spy on him.",
