 "content": "Zinn Toa was a male Nautolan child that was born during the time of the Clone Wars. He was kidnapped by the notorious bounty hunter, Cad Bane, at the behest of Darth Sidious, who had planned to use him, along with other Force-sensitive children, to create an army of dark side spies.\nZinn Toa was a male\nNautolan who was born during the Clone Wars. He resided on the Nautolan home planet of Glee Anselm, and was at some point in his infancy discovered to be Force-sensitive. The Jedi discovered this, and took note of it by adding his identity to the Kyber memory crystal, a device which inside it, listed every known Force-sensitive child in the galaxy. The Duros bounty hunter, Cad Bane stole the crystal at the request of the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who had plans to use the Force-sensitive infants listed to create an army of dark side spies.\nAs part of his job stealing the memory crystal, Bane was also tasked with the kidnapping of four of the infants listed, with Zinn Toa being one of them. He was the first target, and was subsequently taken from his home on the water world and transported to a secret facility on Mustafar. It was not long after this though, that the Jedi discovered of his kidnapping, when Jedi Master Mace Windu foresaw it during a meditation session.\nAhsoka Tano rescued Zinn in a rescue mission on Mustafar with the help of Anakin Skywalker.",
