 "content": "Zint was a Aloxian female Jedi Initiate who lived during the High Republic Era. Around 230 BBY, she was recruited into the Jedi Order by Jedi Master Cherff Maota and was present with other Jedi Initiates aboard the Star Hopper when it was part of a task force sent to capture the Nihil pirate Krix Kamerat at Dol'har Hyde. After the successful capture of Kamerat, Zint bonded with Jedi Padawan and fellow Aloxian Qort aboard the Star Hopper as the ship took Kamerat back to Starlight Beacon. During the journey, Zint was present aboard the ship's bridge when Qort and Farzala Tarabal were knighted, and Zint raised her green-bladed lightsaber in celebration with the other Jedi.\nSometime after the Jedi's arrival at Starlight, the Nihil attacked the space station, and Zint along with Qort, Master Torban Buck and the other younglings were trapped on the station. As they were hunted by a strange entity, they encountered Jedi investigator Emerick Caphtor and private investigator Sian Holt, and Qort ensured that Zint and the younglings made their way onto Holt's ship. A short time later, after Holt recovered a claw of the creature that had hunted the group they, except for Buck who had decided to remain aboard the station, fled the doomed station.",
