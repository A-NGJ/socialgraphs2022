 "content": "Avi Singh was a human male senator who served in the Senate of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and resided on its capital planet Raxus Secundus after the collapse of the Separatist state. After the Galactic Empire began its occupation of his planet, Captain Bragg prefaced a public announcement by telling the citizens that the occupation was for their benefit as long as they complied and gave the Empire their allegiance. Senator Singh told his droid, GS-8, that he could not go through with endorsing the occupation and would not become an Imperial pawn. When it was his turn to speak and endorse the Imperial presence, he instead spoke out, calling the occupation unjust and saying that he and the people would not bow to their acts of intimidation. He was dragged away as the crowd cheered for his actions, but the masses of citizens were soon cleared out by Imperial walkers and Singh was imprisoned. GS-8 contacted Cid, who sent Clone Force 99 to extract Singh. Meanwhile, Bragg prepared to torture Singh to comply. After being rescued, he helped the group escape by directing Tech towards a secret passage through which they escaped the pursuing clone troopers and retreated to the Marauder.\nAvi Singh appeared in \"Common Ground,\" the tenth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, which aired on July 2, 2021. He was voiced by Alexander Siddig.",
