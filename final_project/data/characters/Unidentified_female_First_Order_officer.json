 "content": "This individual was a human female officer who served the First Order during its conflict with the Resistance. Serving under the command of Colonel Erich S. Datoo, she was stationed in the primary fire control room of the Starkiller Base superweapon at the time of the Hosnian Cataclysm. As the Starkiller was draining the power of the sun, she informed General Armitage Hux that the weapon would be fully charged in fifteen minutes.\nThe character was portrayed by Hannah John-Kamen in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. Her role was confirmed in the movie's credits. John-Kamen auditioned only once for the role, reading a scene written specifically for the audition. She filmed her scenes at Pinewood Studios in 2014. Due to the secrecy of the production, the actress was not told what role she was going to play until the day she arrived at the set, nor did she receive her parts of the script until later that day.\nIn the fourth issue of the Force Awakens comic adaptation, the line \"Configure!\" is shown to be shouted by the individual but in the film it is evidently said by the male officer standing a few feet away.",
