 "content": "The father of Velko Jahen was a male Livtak Soikan. Originally fighting for the Livtak Union in the conflict encompassing Soika, he defected to the Gagic Alliance after realizing they were planning something he disapproved of. Jahen, his daughter with a Gagic woman, inherited the Livtak colouration from him. After she took a post as Administrator aboard the Starlight Beacon, Jahen told Chief Ghal Tarpfen about her parentage after the Mon Calamari Head of Security assumed she had fought for the Livtak Union.",
