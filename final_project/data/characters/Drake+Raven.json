 "content": "Drake Raven was a male Human citizen of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. As a protege of the former member of the Knights of Zakuul Nocturno, he became known as the gladiator in the Arena Grand of Zakuul under the title \"The Rising Squire\" by 3630 BBY. That year, Nocturno and her Drake were put up against a newcomer known as \"the Mysterious Stranger\". During the fight in the Arena, Nocturno and Drake were assisted by G0-ON Attacker and G0-ON Abductor droids, but were defeated in the seventh round of the Arena fights.\nDrake Raven appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as part of the seventh boss fight of \"Eternal Championship\". Drake can be bought as a hologram for the player's stronghold as of Update 4.4.",
