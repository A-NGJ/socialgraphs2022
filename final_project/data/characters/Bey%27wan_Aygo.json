 "content": "Bey'wan Aygo was a Bothan male Fleet Admiral of the Republic Navy during the Cold War and Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was born to artistic parents, but when he saw a space battle above his homeworld, Aygo wanted to practice interstellar combat instead. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Kuat. Aygo became the fleet admiral of the Republic First Fleet, where he created an atmosphere of encouragement with his crew.\nWhen the Galactic Republic was assaulted by the Eternal Empire, he came up with many counterattack plans, but all were discarded by Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh, who was more obsessed with fighting the Sith Empire. He was then discharged from the navy. After the defeat of the Republic at the hands of the Eternal Empire, he joined a forming resistance movement known as the Alliance on the planet Odessen as its head of Military Operations.\nAfter joining the Eternal Alliance, Aygo made a bet with the Alliance's Juvard Illip Oggurobb. If Aygo's strongest battleship could not break through Odessen's planetary shield, constructed by Oggurobb, then Aygo would would have to pay Oggurobb a debt. The planetary shield held the assault, and thus Oggurobb won the bet.\nBey'wan Aygo is the first Bothan to appear in the game Star Wars: The Old Republic. If the player character decides to side with the Sith Empire in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught, Aygo decides to retire and chooses Tessa Pardax as his replacement. He is voiced by Steve Blum.",
