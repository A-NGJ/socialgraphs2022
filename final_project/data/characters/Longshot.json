 "content": "\"Longshot\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars with the 212th Battalion.\nLongshot was one of the many clones created on Kamino. He was a soldier in the 212th Attack Battalion.\nWhen Separatist forces captured Jedi Master Even Piell and imprisoned him in the Citadel, a prison on the planet Lola Sayu the Republic mounted a rescue. Longshot was one of the clones assigned to the rescue team under Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to infiltrate the prison. The group was frozen in carbonite and used reprogrammed droids and a stolen Separatist shuttle to get them on Lola Sayu without being detected by the life-form scanners.\nOnce the group was unfrozen, they free-climbed a wall covered with electromines to sneak into the Citadel via a small entrance. Unfortunately, one of the troopers, \"Charger,\" fell and hit one of the mines, which alerted the prison's warden, Osi Sobeck, of their presence, who proceeded to activate the facility's security protocols. Inside the facility the group took out some laser turrets and surveillance. This activated an electric field that moved across the hall towards the group. While the other team members quickly managed to take cover in the side halls, Longshot was caught by the field, which dragged him along before dropping him, electrocuting and killing him.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, Longshot stood at 1.83 meters.\nLongshot wore Phase I clone trooper armor with the orange markings of the 212th Attack Battalion and utilized a standard DC-15A blaster carbine.\nIn the episode, Longshot was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series.",
