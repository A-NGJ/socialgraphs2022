 "content": "A Gamorrean fighter was present in an arena in a warehouse district fighting with another Gamorrean in 9 ABY. Gor Koresh bet on the other Gamorrean to win in the next minute. Koresh then stood up and shot the Gamorrean.\nThe Gamorrean fighter first appeared in the official trailer for the second season of Jon Favreau's Disney+ series The Mandalorian, which was published on YouTube on September 15, 2020. The fighter then appeared in The Mandalorian Season Two debut \"Chapter 9: The Marshal,\" which was directed by Favreau and first aired on Disney+ on October 30, 2020. The Gamorrean was played by Barry Hanley, who was credited as a stunt performer but later confirmed his and fellow stunt performer Matthew Blake Shadden's roles as the two fighters in the episode on Instagram.\nThe Gamorrean was made to be more leaner than the ones found in Jabba's Palace in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The prop team led by property master Josh Roth made both the fighters' axes hollow aluminum with an electric mechanism to present sparks every time the two axes clashed. For the Gamorrean fight, Favreau wanted it to be similar to a Muay Thai fight to lean the atmosphere of the episode into more of a gangster movie in contrast to other themes presented throughout The Mandalorian. Stunt coordinator Ryan Watson helped direct the fighting, intending to present a strong and clumsy style in respect to other styles of fighting in the Star Wars universe.",
