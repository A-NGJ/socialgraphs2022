 "content": "Snee-Roos was a Gran male who lived during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY he was visiting the Core World Corellia on vacation. During his stay on the planet, he recorded a poacher illegally killing a Gronda near Kor Vella. When Gilker Budz of the Corellian Security Force learned of this holorecording, he sent a spacer to meet Snee-Roos and bring the recording to Budz.\nSnee-Roos was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He appeared during a quest given out by Gilker Budz, in which the player had to travel to a specified location and talk to Snee-Roos to retrieve a datadisc.\nDue to the way these missions were designed by the developers, Snee-Roos wore different clothing each time a player ran this mission. Usually the look and even gender and species of such characters also changed each time, but as the game used the same model for all Gran, Snee-Roos' face always looked the same.",
