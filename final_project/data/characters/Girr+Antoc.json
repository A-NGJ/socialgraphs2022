 "content": "Girr Antoc was a male Arcona diplomat of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War. Around 3640 BBY he was visiting the Voss-Ka city on Voss, where he was approached by an Imperial, who claimed to be willing to defect to the Republic. In reality, the Imperial was acting on the orders of agent Feyenn and the only reason for his conversation with Antoc was to secretly record his voice samples.\nGirr Antoc appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic during the mission \"Speaking to the Enemy\" on Voss.",
