 "content": "Genogri was the leader of the warlike Wind Raider tribe of Humans on Taloraan.\nBefore he assumed chieftainship, the Wind Raiders were a peaceful people, but Genogri was ambitious and power hungry and transformed his tribe onto a band of warriors. He did not care much for peaceful negotiations, tending to prefer violent solutions to all conflicts.\nHe possessed a blaster pistol that he had looted from a Rebel operative whom he had betrayed and killed. He was later tricked by other Rebels who acquired the starship of the murdered operativeâ€”also in Genogri's possession. He had test fired the blaster a couple of times, but did not really know how the weapon worked.",
