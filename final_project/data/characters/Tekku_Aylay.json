 "content": "Tekku Aylay was an elderly Twi'lek male who lived in one of the many subterranean camps occupied by his people during the Galactic Empire's occupation of their homeworld Ryloth. After the Empire abandoned the planet, Aylay thanked the resistance fighter Yendor—who had been part of Cham Syndulla's Free Ryloth Movement—while others Twi'leks packed up the camps. The old man then declared they would need the help of the New Republic to maintain their freedom, and suggested that Yendor should be the world's ambassador, much to the other Twi'lek's dismay. Despite Yendor's objections to the idea, the resistance member had indeed become ambassador to the New Republic by the time of the Napkin Bombing incident on the New Republic capital Hosnian Prime.\nTekku Aylay first appeared in an interlude in the novel Aftermath: Life Debt, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2016.",
