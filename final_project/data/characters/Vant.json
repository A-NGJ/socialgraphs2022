 "content": "Vant was a female Rutian Twi'lek Jedi who served the Jedi Order as a docent.\nA Force-sensitive Twi'lek, Vant was educated by the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. Appointed as an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Master Vant was made the caretaker of a clan of Initiates and cared for them as they progressed through the Temple academy from infancy to adolescence.\nIn 44 BBY one of Master Vant's charges, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, was not selected as an apprentice by a Master, and the Council of Reassignment dictated that he was too old to remain at the academy without a master. Going to the clan dormitory, Master Vant delivered the message that Kenobi would have to leave the Temple as he had been reassigned to the Agricultural Corps on the planet Bandomeer.",
