She was the wife of Zabrak Kyran Silene and she was friend with Angela.\nIn 1 ABY, her husband disappeared suddenly. She ignored that a group of Corellian slavers operating near Tyrena captured Kyran and enslaved him. Despite Major Alana Walden of the CorSec was investigating similar disappearances on Corellia, Madison Silene contacted a spacer who had previously helped her friend Angela to find her missing husband. The spacer agreed to help Madison and interrogated Bandor Mokk, a new and suspect friend of Kyran Silene. The man revealed that Kyran Silene was captured by slavers but managed to escape. The spacer traveled to a camp outside Tyrena where gathered a group of escaped slave. Kyran explained that he could not come back until the situation was resolved. After the spacer attacked the Corellian Slaver Bunker and revealed its existence to the CorSec, Kyran Silene eventually returned to a normal life with Madison.\nMadison Silene was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
