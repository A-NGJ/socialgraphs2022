 "content": "Halsia Banso was a female Human Sith Inquisitor of the Sith Empire who was active during the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Banso was among the Sith who were assigned to the Dread Executioners, fighting the forces of the Dread Masters on the moon Oricon during the phase of the conflict known as the Dread War.\nHalsia Banso was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel as part of Game Update 2.4: The Dread War. She appeared on Oricon, where she was the Basic Gear vendor for the Sith Inquisitor class. Banso and the rest of the class gear vendors at Oricon, along with all other Daily Areas and high-level planets, were replaced by standardized vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; she was replaced by Lord Turbis.",
