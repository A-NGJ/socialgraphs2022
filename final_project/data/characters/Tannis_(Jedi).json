 "content": "Tannis was a female Omwati Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Great Sith War.\nA Force-sensitive Omwati, Tannis was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order after being located on Coruscant. Ascending to the rank of Jedi Master, Tannis was appointed as Headmistress of the Teyan Praxeum, a Jedi academy on the planet Teya IV. A proponent of initiating all Forceful sentients within the Order, Tannis served as a recruiter and often traveled the galaxy to find new students to train with her on Teya IV. During her travels to Alderaan in 4000 BBY, Tannis discovered a family with two Forceful children living near Lir Lake. Testing both Vici and Veni Ramunee, she deemed them eligible for Jedi training and took them to the Teyan Academy to learn the ways of the Jedi.\nTannis's appearance at first seemed a continuity error, since the Omwati were not supposed to be discovered until Wilhuff Tarkin's lifetime. Alien Anthology retconned this by explaining that a mysterious Omwati colony was established on Coruscant long before Tarkin discovered Omwat. How the colony came to be there is uncertain, but it may indicate the Omwati had contact with the galactic community prior to the Old Sith Wars.",
