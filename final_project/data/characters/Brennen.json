 "content": "Brennen was a male Human living on the Eternal Empire capital of Zakuul. He was the son of the Exalted, leader of the Heralds of Zildrog, a cult worshipping the mythical serpent-god Zildrog that controlled the Old World of Zakuul. In 3631 BBY Brennen was captured by the Lady of Sorrows, who used him as a hostage to convince his father to come to the Razor. Upon arriving to meet with the Lady of Sorrows, the Heralds were overpowered and all of them were killed. The Exalted himself was personally killed by the Lady, who made Brennen into the new Exalted, leaving him to lead the Heralds.\nBrennen appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 7: The Lady of Sorrows.",
