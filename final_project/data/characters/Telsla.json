 "content": "Telsla was an Abednedo male criminal and the leader of his crew. He worked alongside Belk and Fleecs in taking over Tomarian's theater during the Tomarian's Annual Festival of Light Gala. Tomarian owned Telsla credits but Tomarian didn't have the credits for him. But the Abednedo did not believe Tomarian and began to blow up areas of his theater. But then Telsla and Fleecs realized that Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was previously knocked unconscious, had fled. This worried him to know that there was a Jedi on the loose but he took it upon himself to locate Skywalker.",
