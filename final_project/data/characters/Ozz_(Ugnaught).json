 "content": "King Ozz of the Ugnaughts was an Ugnaught male who served as the king of Ugnorgrad, a terraformed floating platform that housed a society of Ugnaughts in the atmosphere of Bespin, a gas giant in the Anoat sector. During the Iron Blockade, in which the Galactic Empire blockaded the Anoat sector to prevent its occupants from learning of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine's death during the Empire's crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor, Imperials continually plagued Ugnorgrad. Ozz offered valuable resources to anyone who would help deal with the Imperials.\nThe individual known as the Smuggler sent a member of their crew to aid Ozz in dealing with the Imperials and earned the resources he offered.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, Ozz was mentioned in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, which was developed by Kabam and shut down in 2016. He was mentioned in an optional Crew Run mission, which this article assumes was successfully completed as part of 100% game completion.\nOzz originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where he first appeared in Star Wars 57, an issue of Marvel Comics' Star Wars comic-book series published on December 15, 1981. The issue was written by David Michelinie, Walt Simonson, and Louise Jones, with illustrations by Simonson.",
