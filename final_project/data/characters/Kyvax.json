 "content": "Kyvax was a male Geonosian who was employed during the Cold War by Colonel Gorik of the reconstituted Sith Empire. His job was to construct droid-bombs that were to be used in an attack on the settlement of Anchorhead, on Tatooine. Kyvax carried out this task at the Northern Windfarm, a location in Tatooine's Jundland Wastes. However, a Jedi Knight investigated the situation and fought against Kyvax's fellow Geonosians on the windfarm in order to stop them. Kyvax himself was killed by the Havoc Squad lieutenant.",
