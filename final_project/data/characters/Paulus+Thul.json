 "content": "Paulus Thul was a Human male who served as Lord of House Thul during the Cold War. Savorin Malfus the Seventh sought to earn Paulus's favor.\nPaulus Thul appears as a character in the Bounty Hunter mission \"Spiking the Punch\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the people Savorin Malfus asks the player to deliver gifts to. Players can choose to do Malfus's errands for light side alignment points, but as the Bounty Hunter is an Imperial class and thus assumed to make the dark side choices, this article assumes that the hunter refused and beat up Malfus.",
