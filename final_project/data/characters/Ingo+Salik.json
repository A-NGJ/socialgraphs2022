 "content": "Ingo Salik was a male human born before 20 ABY who served the First Order under Commander Wanten at the First Order detention center based in Harra the Hutt's stronghold on the planet Vodran in 34 ABY. Salik reported directly to Commander Wanten and served as commanding officer to the detachment of stormtroopers stationed on Vodran. He was put in charge of interrogating the J-Squadron prisoners Mattis Banz and Lorica Demaris. Demaris used her Zeltron physiology to try and escape over the course of the weeks they were there, and Salik thought he was bringing Demaris over to the First Order. When the Resistance members finally made their escape, Salik was knocked down.\nSalik had jet-black hair and light skin. He was a proud individual, who considered his work with the First Order very important.\nIngo Salik first appeared in the 2017 canon junior novel Join the Resistance: Escape from Vodran by Ben Blacker and Ben Acker.",
