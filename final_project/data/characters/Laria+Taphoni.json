 "content": "Laria was a female Human who worked with the Galactic Republic during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Laria, along with Tal and Doctor Gatten Edaine, was stationed on Taris, a planet that was ravaged three hundred years ago. She was part of an expedition that were assigned to work with Jedi Master Cin Tykan to investigate the desolated swampland populated by rakghouls. However, when most members of the expedition was killed with the exception of Tykan himself and a survey team, who had left before the attack, Laria and Tal were trapped under a large piece of debris before the Barsen'thor arrived. After the Consular levitated Tal back to safety, Laria was the final surviving member of the expedition to be saved.",
