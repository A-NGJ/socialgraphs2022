 "content": "Aervis Wint was a Gungan of middle years who worked for Gungan Security in Gadrin.\nAervis did not get out much, so was generally not up to date on current events. He sometimes nervously chewed on the tip of one of his ears. In 31 BBY, fellow employee Broof Yurdel and twelve other of the company's employees disappeared to join the Cularin resistance. The additional workload caused Aervis to lose a lot of sleep.",
