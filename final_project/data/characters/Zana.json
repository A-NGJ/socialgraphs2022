 "content": "Zana was a female Human living on Belderone during the Galactic Civil War. During the Clone Wars, Zana had a romance with a Jedi Knight named Flint Torul who was posted to Belderoneâ€”the two conceived a son, also called Flint, before Torul was killed in battle by General Grievous. Zana, forced to raise her son alone, worked as a night shift waitress as Flint grew into adulthood. In 3 ABY, Zana was killed by an Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport that laid waste to her hometown during a Rebel attack on Belderone. Believing the Alliance responsible for his mother's death, Flint joined the Empire and was later trained as a Sith apprentice by Darth Vader.\nZana appeared in Star Wars Annual  3, written by Mary Jo Duffy, illustrated by Klaus Janson and released in 1983.",
