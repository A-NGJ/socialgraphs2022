 "content": "An Imperial officer was present on Nixus Hub 218 in 3 BBY. He led an operation to capture two Lasat refugees, Gron and Chava, after being tipped off by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka. However, Ohnaka had also informed his friend, the rebel Ezra Bridger, a member of the Spectres, of the refugees, so they arrived just in time to attack and take out the officer and his stormtroopers, Ezra personally stunning the officer with his lightsaber-blaster. The Spectres and Ohnaka hid the unconscious officer and his troopers inside the same cargo container that Gron and Chava had been hiding in.\nHe is voiced by Steve Blum.",
