 "content": "Sebla Sarobia was a human female who attended the Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors in the Forbidden Valley of the planet Pasaana in 35 ABY. She danced with a group of humans while the hermit Lando Calrissian led several Resistance agents through the festival to safety after the agents were spotted by the First Order.\nWhile at the festival, Sarobia wore green and blue robes with various jewelry, including a golden necklace and a silver piece that concealed a holocam for personal protection. She kept her money in a purse on her green and gold belt buckle. A green veil protected her black hair, which she wore in an elaborate Antarian coiffure. She had tan skin and brown eyes.\nSebla Sarobia was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was simultaneously identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
