 "content": "Kerri was a human female who lived on the planet Kenari with her brother Kassa. When Kerri was six years old, Kassa joined a party of villagers going to investigate the crash site of a starship, while Kerri was left behind. Kassa did not return from the mission, as he became separated from the group and was taken offworld by Maarva and Clem Andor, who wanted to rescue him from danger.\nYears later, Kassa, now Cassian Andor, searched for his sister on Morlana One at a brothel, having heard there was a girl from Kenari there. However, after consulting a hostess, he learned that the girl had left months before.\nKerri first appeared in the first episode of the live-action Disney+ series Andor. She was portrayed by Belle Swarc.",
