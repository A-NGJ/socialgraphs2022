 "content": "Rizzal was a Turazza who worked for Loh'khar the Finder. She was the Twi'lek's information gatherer.\nThe sister of Nizzal and Vizzal, Rizzal's speciality was knowing who had information that was useful, and what they would want in exchange for it. She was also adept at breaking into computer systems to retrieve needed data. She joined the crew of the FarStar alongside her master and sisters.\nBecause of her interest in computers, Rizzal would often be found observing people working at a computer, somehow managing to peer over their shoulder despite being small.\nThe quietest of the Turazza sisters, she often disappeared for long periods to sift through data or acquire new batches. She was tolerant of her sisters, despite Nizzal's bullying.",
