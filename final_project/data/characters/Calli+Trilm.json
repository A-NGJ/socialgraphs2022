 "content": "Calli Trilm was a female Human who served as commander of the Clysm Fleet and general of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Trilm was known to be a confidante of Count Dooku, and according to the records of Lieutenant Laurita Tohm, she may have been even closer with him. During the Clone Wars, she was captured by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and was imprisoned within The Prism.\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Gentis coup, Trilm was released and became part of a brutal test created by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, to see who among the prisoners was worthy of joining the New Order. Trilm was killed in the battle.",
