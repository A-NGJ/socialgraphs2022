 "content": "Bask Sunn was a Dar'manda lieutenant, recruitment officer and a former Mandalorian, who represented the Dar'manda in Heta Kol's organization known as the Hidden Chain during the third Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, around 3626 BBY. Sunn was a Mandalorian Combat Master.\nIn 3626 BBY, Bask Sunn lead a group of Dar'manda to attack the Spirit of Vengeance II alongside Clan Varad and the Ash'ad at the behest of Heta Kol. He was confronted by the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo, who bested him in combat. He pleaded for his life by giving the Commander and Rass a set of codes and a personal transport that would enable them to carry on destroying the tethers that were latched to the Spirit of Vengeance II, and was subsequently spared by Rass. He later reported to Heta Kol following their retreat from the ship, who gave him new orders. He then also sent a message asking the Commander for his transport back, since it was part of a matching set.",
