 "content": "Stuvany Inglen was a Human female member of the Lok Revenants who lived on Lok during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Stuvany Inglen was a member of the Lok Revenants and a lieutenant of their leader Nym. She used to work in Nym's palace, in the city known as Nym's Stronghold.\nIn 1 ABY, Inglen was involved in most major operations of the Lok Revenants. That year, the Lok Revenants assaulted the hideout of their enemies, the Sulfur Lake Pirates, to retrieve the valuable memory module of an Imperial droid. Stuvany Inglen tasked a spacer involved in this mission to rescue a Lok Revenant who had been captured by the pirates and was detained in their hideout. The same year, the Lok Revenants raided an Imperial mine where the release of an unknown toxic gas had made the miners become completely crazy and very hostile. Inglen requested the spacer to steal as much mined ore as possible. Later, the Revenants attacked an Imperial research facility on Lok to steal experimental weapons developed and produced there. This time, Stuvany Inglen asked the spacer to steal lab data in the research facility. With the information collected, she eventually discovered that the Empire was constructing weapons to be distributed on Lok, and not for the use of the Imperial forces. Nevertheless, the final purpose of the Empire remained mysterious for Inglen.\nStuvany Inglen was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Stuvany Inglen was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park,\" released with the \"Game Update 16,\" on March 23, 2010.",
