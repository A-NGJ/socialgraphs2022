 "content": "Yussa was a Human female who served as a major in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. She was stationed on Carrick Station.\nMajor Yussa appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendors for the Trooper class; her actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history, and she has been added to and removed from various worlds. She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
