 "content": "Reye Nenilin was a doctor who was an expert in genetics during the time of the Clone Wars. He was approached in the Haunch of Nerf on Coruscant by Mandalorians Mij Gilamar, Kal and Mereel Skirata, who gave him a part of some genetic research that had been obtained from Ko Sai, to see if he could do anything with it, to control the aging process in clones. Nenilin hoped to use the data to win the Republic Science Acolade, but he soon realized that it was of Kaminoan origin. He handed it over to the Galactic Republic in hope that its shady origins wouldn't ruin his chance of getting the reward. However, Nenilin went missing shortly afterward.",
