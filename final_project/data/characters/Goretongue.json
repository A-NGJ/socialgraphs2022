 "content": "Goretongue was a particularly large and dangerous minstyngar thrasher that lived on the Wroshyr Canopy level of the Rryatt Trail on Kashyyyk.\nGoretongue was a creature in Rage of the Wookiees, the second expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. It could be found on the Wroshyr Canopy level of the Rryatt Trail. It was a level 64 Gold Chevron boss, which meant that it was much stronger and tougher than normal minstyngars and even posed a threat to players with higher levels. It was not involved in any quests and did not necessarily need to be killed by the player.",
