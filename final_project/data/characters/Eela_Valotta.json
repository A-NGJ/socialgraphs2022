 "content": "Eela Valotta was a female Twi'lek who was an agent of the so-called \"Freedom Convoy\" during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Her associate was Tray'la Sheek. She was wanted by Jabba Desilijic Tiure for kidnapping several Twi'leks from the Hutt's personal harem. The bounty, which was 3,000 credits if Valotta was brought in alive and 1,500 if she was brought in dead, was claimed by Jango Fett.",
