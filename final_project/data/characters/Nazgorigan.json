 "content": "Nazgorigan was a male Jablogian trader and conman who operated on the planet of Thune, in Wild Space. Being overweight like all members of his species, he used to move about in a personal hover-saucer.\nNazgorigan produced his own brand of insect repellent, which he would propose to spacers who visited the Thune spaceport for the first time. Instead of selling the gullible visitors his actual product, however, Nazgorigan sold them canisters of stagnant water from Thune's canals. Despite the warning of their droid CR-8R, the young siblings Lina and Milo Graf fell to the Jablogian's con when they arrived on Thune.",
