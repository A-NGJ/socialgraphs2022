 "content": "Murble was a poor Human beggar and street-corner animal trainer who wandered through the corridors and bazaars of the Southern Underground on Coruscant. He was a small man with pale skin from years of underground living. He had dark patches under his eyes and a sickly appearance. He made a meager living by performing with his trained bursa named Fierce, who was as stooped and sickly as her master, but able to perform simple tricks.",
