 "content": "Hextal was a Arcona male agent of the Republic Strategic Information Service living during the Galactic War. Around 3641 BBY Hextal was stationed in the High Security Section on Belsavis, where he was assigned to track Imperial communications. In his sweeps, he pinpointed a looping transmission from the Ancient Prison Caverns and sent prison warden droids to retrieve the passkey needed to bypass the frequency. The droids reported success, but were soon overran by Esh-kha and dismantled, so Hextal was forced to ask a Republic representative in the area to retrieve the passkey from the droids manually.\nAgent Hextal appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as an NPC on Belsavis, where he begins the mission \"Open Communications\".",
