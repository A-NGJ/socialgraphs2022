 "content": "A female H'nemthe with blue-gray skin was present in the palace of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure on Tatooine in 4 ABY. The H'nemthe stood in Jabba's throne room next to an Aqualish and the Duros Leslomy Tacema when the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker arrived to rescue his friend Han Solo, who was a prisoner of the Hutt. Skywalker was dropped into the pit of Jabba's rancor; he killed the beast, however, and was dragged past the H'nemthe by several palace guards on his way to stand before Jabba and receive punishment.\nThe H'nemthe present in Jabba's Palace is briefly visible in a background shot of Richard Marquand's 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The character's mask was recycled from the set of the 1977 film Star Wars, where it was originally used as the head of M'iiyoom Onith in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene.\nA Human male was also present in Jabba's Palace, wearing an exact duplicate of the H'nemthe's costume with the exception of a black helmet replacing the H'nemthe mask.",
