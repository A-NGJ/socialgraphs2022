 "content": "Myn Kyneugh was a Human male who served as an Imperial Guard in service to Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire.\nThe teacher of many Royal Guard trainees, Kyneugh was unswervingly loyal and remembered nothing of his past before serving the Emperor. He was an early teacher of Carnor Jax and Kir Kanos. He led the Imperial Guards that followed their master to the second Death Star and died when it exploded.\nIn the non-canon comic The Return of Tag \u0026 Bink: Special Edition, in place of Myn Kyneugh and his partner, Tag Greenley and Bink Otauna were disguised as Emperor's Royal Guards in the Emperor's throne room where Palpatine and Darth Vader were plotting to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. When Tag and Bink were told to leave the throne room, they tried to find the elevator to escape from Death Star II, but the only elevator was on the other side of the tower they came from. Not wanting to look foolish, Tag and Bink watched the duel between Luke and Vader, as well as Palpatine's death from the redeemed Anakin. After Luke dragged Vader's body through the elevator, Tag and Bink were waiting for the elevator to return. However the Death Star was destroyed before Tag and Bink could leave the battle station.",
