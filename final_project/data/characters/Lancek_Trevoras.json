 "content": "Lancek Trevoras was a Toong alive during the Clone Wars.\nLancek Tevoras was first mentioned in concept art for the Toong workers seen in \"Together Again,\" the eighth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series' revival season, which aired in 2020. Trevoras was set to appear in production code episode 5.22 of the series, one of the four episodes that made up the unfinished bounty hunters arc, however due to the show's cancelation this arc was never completed. The Clone Wars Art Director Kilian Plunkett stated that, when working on \"Together Again,\" the Toong species was chosen to contrast the towering Trandoshan manager seen in the episode. As such, artist JP Balmet designed the Toong workers seen in the finished episode, which were sourced from Trevoras' character model.\nThough Kyle Newman was set to voice a Toong in an unfinished episode of The Clone Wars, it is not known if he was to voice Trevoras, or a different Toong.",
