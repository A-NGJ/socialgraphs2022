 "content": "CC-2801, nicknamed \"Tacks,\" was a Clone Commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars fought between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. As a commander, he was in charge of a regiment of clone troopers.\nCC-2801 was born on the planet Kamino from the genetic material of Jango Fett, a bounty hunter who became the template of the clone trooper army. CC-2801 eventually adopted the nickname \"Tacks\" and achieved the military rank of Clone Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. At the time of the pan-galactic conflict between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic, the Clone Commander was in charge of a regiment.\nAs with all clone troopers of the Galactic Republic, CC-2801 was a clone of Jango Fett, and as such, stood at 1.83 meters tall and was a human male. He also had black hair and tan skin.\nTacks was equipped with phase I clone trooper armor before upgrading to phase II clone trooper armor later on. On both sets of clone trooper armor, he outfitted his armor with macrobinoculars and a black pauldron.\nTacks is the announcer for the Galactic Republic in the multiplayer modes of Star Wars Battlefront II, a video game released in 2017 and published by EA Digital Illusions CE, Motive Studios, and Criterion Games. Like all clone troopers in the game, he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who also voiced the clones in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. The official spelling of his nickname was clarified by the EA Community manager Jay Ingram on his Twitter account.",
