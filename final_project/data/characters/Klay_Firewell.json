 "content": "Klay Firewell was a Human boy who was a native of Corulag.\nIn 23 BBY, Princess Calvaria of Nallastia had about 20 of her warriors ambush and kidnap his parents, Hondu and Tattyra Firewell. Having come to Nallastia for a zoological expedition, to study the indigenous fauna, the Firewells unlawfully trespassed . As a result, Princess Calvaria imprisoned the couple within an energy field.\nIn the foothills of Nallastia's volcanic Mount Octan, Klay soon met and befriended the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker, who—remembering his own mother, bound against her will to slavery—traveled to the Skull Queen's fortress and took the princess hostage, in order to bargain for the release of Klay's parents. Calvaria's mother, the Margravine Quenelle, acquiesced and teamed up with Skywalker's Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to locate the Lost Stars of Nallastia, three ancient jewels that could disable the energy field. The hunt was a success, culminating in the Cavern of Screaming Skulls, and Klay's parents were freed.",
