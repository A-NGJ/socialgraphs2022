 "content": "Saponza was a male human from the sun-scorched planet of Tatooine who worked as a mercenary. He claimed to have taken part in the Mytaranor Campaign, writing it in his experience section in the Undervine network.\nAt some point between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth, Saponza and his partner established a base of operations in the former's Tatooinian homestead. The two mercenaries soon attracted the wrath of Jabba, the resident Hutt crime lord of Tatooine. Bib Fortuna, Jabba's chief of staff, contacted him and his companion several times, and even though he warned them about Jabba's revenge, they still ignored it, possibly believing Jabba would forget or simply not bother. In retaliation for the death of six of his henchmen, Jabba had Saponza's homestead razed to the ground. Realizing that they could not defeat the Hutt on their own, Saponza and his partner were forced to pick a side in the Galactic Civil War and chose to join the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance.\nAt the time of the Galactic Civil War, Saponza was an older, yet broad-shouldered human sporting white hair. He was outwitted by Bib Fortuna, and did not believe Jabba would bother to seek revenge. He did dispatch six of Jabba's henchmen however and was skilled with a blaster, despite being slightly weak minded.\nSaponza  was created for Star Wars: Commander, a 2014 mobile strategy game by Disney Interactive. In the game, Saponza assists the player regardless of the player's affiliation.",
