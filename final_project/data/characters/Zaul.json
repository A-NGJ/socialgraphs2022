 "content": "Zaul was a human male captain who served in the military of the Galactic Empire around the time of the Iron Blockade. Two months into the blockade, Captain Zaul was stationed at an Imperial outpost on Nar Hypa, in the Mataou system. One day, the outpost was infiltrated by a young smuggler who had broken into the outpost to recover seized goods. With the help of TK-412 and TK-408, two stormtrooper unit leaders, Zaul attempted to stop the smuggler. The three Imperials, however, were killed in the ensuing firefight.\nCaptain Zaul first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising. He was the end boss of the story mission \"You Found What?\"",
