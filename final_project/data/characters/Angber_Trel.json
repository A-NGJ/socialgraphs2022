 "content": "Angber Trel was a human male member of the Disciples of the Whills, a religious group that congregated around the Temple of the Kyber in Jedha City on the moon Jedha. He was present in the city in the year 0 BBY at the time of its destruction by the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon. Trel wore the order's distinctive red robes and carried a walking stick made from salvaged power cells. He had tanned skin and gray hair.\nAngber Trel was portrayed by Albert Tang in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016. He was not identified by the film, but received a name—an anagram of the name of the actor who played him—in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on the same day as the film.",
