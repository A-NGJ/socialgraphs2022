 "content": "Trenox was a Dark Acolyte who worked for Count Dooku during the Clone Wars.\nTrenox was a bald man who wielded a red lightsaber and wore all black. He was taught Form II of lightsaber combat by Count Dooku himself.\nTrenox helped Count Dooku command the Separatist forces in the Coruscant Insurrection of the Clone Wars. During the battle, Trenox fled from Anakin Skywalker to Bentho's Nightclub, located on the underlevels of the city. Dexter Jettster was in the lower levels when Trenox threatened him. The diner owner was able to escape from the Acolyte. Trenox stopped to fight Anakin in a club then fled again. He jumped into a speeder hoping to lose the Jedi.\nLater on, Trenox sneaked into the Jedi Temple with Count Dooku. He confronted Anakin in the temple, but after a long duel Trenox was defeated by Skywalker.\nTrenox wielded his lightsaber like a club, and roared to intimidate his opponents. He was able to knock Anakin Skywalker down with a casual nudge of the Force, render him momentarily unconscious, and could break through Anakin's Form V with his brute strength. Dooku had also taught Trenox the more refined Form II.",
