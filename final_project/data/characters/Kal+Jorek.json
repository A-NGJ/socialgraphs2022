 "content": "Kal Jorek was a Corellian, who worked as a weapons smuggler for the Hutt Cartel.\nWorking alongside his right hand man, the Defel Frizz, Jorek worked importing illegal weapons to peaceful systems. They would then inflict chaos and fear onto the local populations, to create demand for their weapons. They once traveled to the planet Naboo, where they sold weapons from a warehouse on the outskirts of Theed, the planet's capital city. While they were there, the Naboo Security officer Lieutenant Trayl Caltos hired some mercenaries to stake out the warehouse and capture Jorek and Frizz.",
