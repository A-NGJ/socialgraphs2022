 "content": "Xet was a Falleen female member of the Black Sun crime syndicate who later became a spy for the Crimson Dawn syndicate, feeding them information on Black Sun. Xet attended the Auction for Han Solo that was hosted by Crimson Dawn, where she was attacked by Doctor Chelli Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros, who stole a necklace Xet wore that included data crystals which housed information on Black Sun.\nXet was a Falleen female with green skin and black hair, and a member of the Black Sun criminal syndicate. At some point she became a spy for the resurgent criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Xet attended the Auction for Han Solo hosted by Crimson Dawn on the planet Jekara. Prior to the auction beginning, Xet spoke with Gallin Crae, a former member of the Sixth Kin syndicate, when Doctor Chelli Aphra attempted to steal a necklace worn by Xet that included three data crystals, which yielded information on Black Sun's inner workings. The attempt failed, however, and Xet was forced to clean up drink spilled on her clothing by Aphra.\nWhilst cleaning her clothing, Xet and her droid were attacked by Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros. Starros rendered Xet unconscious and secured the necklace, while Aphra sliced into the droid, discovering that the Falleen was a Crimson Dawn spy. Aphra and Starros eventually gave the necklace to their employer, Domina Tagge of the House of Tagge.\nXet first appeared in the twelfth issue of Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, written by Alyssa Wong and penciled by Minkyu Jung, released on July 14, 2021.",
