 "content": "\"Fast\" Vanush Thriin was a male Bith who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war he worked as a speeder vendor in the city of Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine. Vanush had five models of speeder on sale, the Rendili Protector, Rendili Watchman, Czerka Patroller, Czerka Cruiser and the Ubrikkian Striker. He offered each vehicle for 10,000 credits and had each vehicle on display for potential customers. As a Bith, he had pink skin and black eyes and whilst working he wore green and brown clothing.\nVanush first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. Vanush's role in the game is that of a mount vendor for players of the Republic faction, as Anchorhead is a Republic area. Vanush was also mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, which provided his last name.",
