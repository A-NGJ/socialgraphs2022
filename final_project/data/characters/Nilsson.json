Here, he assisted several spacers with handling job records on the planet.\nNilsson was a non-player character in the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. In the game, players could talk to him to reset most quests on the planet of Dantooine, for one time only. After each server reset, Nilsson's appearance would change. However, he always appeared as a fair skinned, Human male.",
