 "content": "Wrenga Jixton, better known as Jix, was an Imperial agent working directly for Darth Vader.\nWrenga Jixton was born on Corellia and eventually enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Carida. Jix's training helped find him a place as a combat trainer for new recruits. Later, Jix was placed on a mission with Darth Vader in 8 BBY. The mission was the sterilization of Falleen and involved the deaths of 200,000 Falleen. Jix did not perform his duty admirably and was court-martialled and sent to the spice mines of Kessel. Jix eventually orchestrated a miraculous escape, after which he fled to the remote world of Aridus and befriended the local Chubbits. Around 0 ABY, Darth Vader came to Aridus in an effort to capture Luke Skywalker. Vader was being helped by an impersonator of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The actor was ordered to lead Skywalker into a trap within the Iron Tower on Aridus. Unfortunately for Vader, the actor betrayed him and destroyed the tower, killing himself and injuring Vader severely.\nJix saw the whole thing play out and went to survey the damage from the tower. There he found Vader unconscious and vulnerable. On Aridus, Jix had come to appreciate the local Chubbits and did not want to see them harmed by an Imperial occupation. He saved Vader's life and brought him back to Coruscant. When Vader awoke, Jix struck a deal with the Dark Lord, forcing him to promise to leave Aridus and the local Chubbits alone in exchange for Jix's eternal servitude. Vader agreed, and Jix reentered Imperial service as Vader's personal servant.\nJix quickly proved a capable servant to Vader by exposing a traitor, whom Vader executed. Jix was later assigned to ensure the survival of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. Vader was well aware that Prince Xizor of Black Sun was attempting to kill Skywalker. Jix traveled to Tatooine with orders to infiltrate Jabba Desilijic Tiure's swoop gang. Shortly after landing in Mos Eisley, Jix confronted the swoop gang, led by Big Gizz and Spiker.\nDespite Jix's tough talk, he was unable to fend off the entire gang once they began beating him with chains and bludgeons until Gizz ordered them to stop. Impressed with his guts, Gizz suggested that Jix race to prove whether he could join the gang. Jix accepted the challenge, and won by shooting his competitor. Again, Big Gizz was impressed and accepted Jix into the gang.\nAs a swoop racer, Jix went on to participate in racing championship. On Corellia, in the preparation for Agrilat Swamp Circuit race, Jix was approached by an operative sent by Lonay. The Black Sun vigo had a personal vendetta against racing star Kimmi Chyler and attempted to use both Jix and his operative to humiliate her. Jix agreed that Chyler's downfall would help his team and accepted the help. The operative was hired as a mechanic and was to inspect Chyler's swoop for illegal modifications. Chyler, however, won the race anyway, and Jix was furious, confronting her and her team after the race.\nMeanwhile, Jabba had received word from Xizor about killing Luke. Jix suggested this would greatly anger Darth Vader, which drew many laughs from the gang. Jabba then sent the gang to kill Luke, who was staying in Ben Kenobi's hut in the Dune Sea. Earlier in Mos Eisley, Jix had mentioned in the cantina his affiliation with the Galactic Empire and was overheard by Dash Rendar. Rendar sped to Luke's aid, but arrived after the gang did.\nLuke was nearly overwhelmed by the swoop gang, but held his own aboard a hijacked swoop and led them through Beggar's Canyon. When Spiker got a clear shot at Luke, Jix rammed his swoop into Spiker's to keep Luke alive. Although Jix broke both of his legs in the crash, Spiker was nearly dead and Luke alive and well. However, there was still Big Gizz to worry about. Gizz, furious at losing more than half his gang to Luke and Dash, leveled his rifle at Luke but was struck in the skull with a rock by Jix. Jix fulfilled his mission, allowing Luke to live so that Vader himself could deal with him.\nLater, Jix was still with the swoop gang as Boba Fett delivered Han Solo, still frozen in carbonite, to Jabba the Hutt. Fett's ship, Slave I, landed on the outskirts of Jabba's land, and a swoop rode out of the cargo hold, towing a hovering platform. Several bounty hunters pursued the swoop rider, presumably Fett. Also in pursuit was the swoop gang. Jix and Spiker were shot down. Spiker was severely wounded, ending up near-dead. Just then Jix hid a communications code book on Spiker's body in order to make him look like a traitor to Jabba the Hutt. The bounty hunters caught up with the swoop rider, only to find it was not Boba Fett at all, but a decoy. The real Boba Fett had successfully handed in his bounty on Solo.\nJix was created for the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia project, based on a background character in Jabba's Palace in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. His role in the story was originally filled by a character named \"Talan,\" created by John Wagner and described as the leader of a \"savage,\" \"nomadic space tribe.\"",
