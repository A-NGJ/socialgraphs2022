 "content": "Sarin was a Lethan Twi'lek female who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as an undercover agent during the Galactic Civil War.\nSarin was a skilled Rebel undercover agent, due to being a rare Lethan Twi'lek, which made her sought after. This allowed her to operate undercover for 5 years on the planet Feddasyr without her cover ever being blown.\nDuring a mission to steal a DSS-02 shield generator, she was sent on the planet Feddasyr, in order to gather information about the independent industrialist Jock Tardee. However, her cover was blown and she was forced to go into hiding before meeting with her rebel contact. After reaching the cantina where she was supposed to meet her contact, Sarin realized that an imperial Cerean agent. However, before the Cerean could do any harm, he was killed by the poison placed in his drinks by Sarin's rebel contact, Leia Organa. After going to Leia's penthouse and giving her all the data on the target, the princess gave Sarin orders to cover her.\nThat night, Leia infiltrated Jock Tardee's party under the alias of Nahob Skuts. While trying to find the imperial codes taken by Jock Tardee, an imperial Trandoshan agent, sent for the codes as well, realized that Nahob Skuts was Leia Organa. However, before the Trandoshan could blow the princess's cover, he was by Sarin, using the sniper rifle left by Leia on the penthouse's balcony. After retrieving a stormtrooper defector, which had the imperial codes encoded in his DNA, Leia managed to escape the party and meet with Sarin, handing the stormtrooper in her care before being captured by an imperial patrol. Sarin managed to evade the patrol and meet with her sister, who was also part of the Alliance. She told her sister that the stormtrooper was \"of critical importance to the cause\" and had to be taken to the next rebel contact on a backwater planet.",
