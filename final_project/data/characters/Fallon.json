 "content": "Fallon was a male Human teenager who lived in Gadrin on Cularin during the Clone Wars. He was the leader of Borus's Boys, a street gang that hung around near Gadrin Dump, but he was also friends with the speeder bike gang, the SkyHawks. On one occasion while he was walking down a street in Gadrin, a group of Thaereian military troopers from Task Force Vermin jumped out of a speeder and tried to capture him. Fallon ran for his life and he was able to evade the Thaereians with the help of the Heroes of Cularin.",
