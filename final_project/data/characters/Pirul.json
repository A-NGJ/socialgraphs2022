 "content": "Pirul was a male Human Flight Commander within the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. Faced with an increasing number of Republic attacks in space, he mobilized the Kaas Twenty-third and Dread Wing squadrons to repel the invaders, but their efforts proved insufficient. To combat the threat, he oversaw the formation of an elite attack squadron called Empire's Fury. Pirul personally contacted the Sith Apprentice of Darth Baras, the Sith Apprentice of Darth Zash, Intelligence Agent Cipher Nine and a bounty hunter participating in the Great Hunt and persuaded them to lend their effort to the Empire's cause.\nPirul was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He contacts Imperial players on board their ship by holocomm, just after they complete their Dromund Kaas storylines and receive their own ship. He recruits the player into the Empire's Fury Squadron, which serves as the plotline for the space missions available to the players.",
