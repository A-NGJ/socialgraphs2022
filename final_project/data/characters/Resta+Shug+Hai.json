 "content": "Resta Shug Hai was a female X'Ting from Ord Cestus who was the last living member of her clan and also a terrorist group known as Desert Wind, which opposed the Five Families of the planet. As a farmer, she and her husband worked the land near Kibo Lake. After her husband died trying to gain extra money while working in the mines around 22 BBY, she eagerly joined Jedi Master Kit Fisto's resistance movement. When the Galactic Republic clone trooper Jangotat was brought to her for healing, she assisted him until he had recovered. As Jangotat went out to destroy the Five Families, she pleaded with him to let her come along, but he refused, citing that she needed to preserve her clan's culture.",
