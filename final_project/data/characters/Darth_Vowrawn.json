 "content": "Darth Vowrawn was a male Pureblood Dark Lord of the Sith who was the third to rule the reconstituted Sith Empire as Sith Emperor. Prior to this, he was an elite member of the Dark Council that governed in the first emperor's stead, in charge of Production and Logistics and later Civil Administration under his predecessor Darth Acina.\nUnder his reign, the Sith Empire went to war against the Galactic Republic for the third time since the Great Galactic War.\nAs a member of the Dark Council, Darth Vowrawn enjoyed a hedonistic and luxurious life, owning estates on every major Sith world. During this time, he had great influence over his fellow councilors and would orchestrate the rise and fall of many of his peers. In one such conspiracy, Vowrawn raised Darth Decimus to the council in exchange for Armageddon Battalion as well as Decimus's allegiance.\nDarth Vowrawn participated in the arrest of Lord Calypho along with two fellow Dark Councilors, including Darth Marr, within the council chamber on Dromund Kaas. The Dark Lord also had at least one apprentice, an ambitious Sith Lord named Qet. To honor his master, Qet brought in a massive army of slaves to secretly build a great statue of Vowrawn in the jungles of Dromund Kaas, an edifice that became known as the Unfinished colossus.\nDuring the Galactic War, Vowrawn was one of the members of the Dark Council that opposed the ascendance of Darth Baras. This was especially the case after Baras claimed to have held the title of Voice of the Emperor. Vowrawn in this time had learned that Darth Baras was greatly aided by the prophetic words of a Force being known as the Entity that was kept chained under powerful enchantments on Corellia. Thus, he concluded that the only way to defeat Baras was freeing this dark spirit.\nDuring the restart of hostilities with the Galactic Republic, Vowrawn was in charge of Imperial efforts on Corellia, where he hid his presence within the Incorporation Islands. He was protected by a cadre of Sith loyal to him in this time as he watched for assassins that were being sent by Baras. During this time, he came into contact with Baras's former Sith apprentice, the new Emperor's Wrath, and believed that the Sith was part of his enemy's plot to assassinate him. The Wrath was forced to fight through Vowrawn's retainers and kill Sith Lord Haresh, before Qet stood alone against him as the last line of defense. Vowrawn then revealed himself, seeing that the Wrath was much stronger than any of his followers and ordered Qet to stand down. He then requested that the Wrath not grant him the indignity of decapitation. The Wrath insisted to having been sent by the Emperor's Hands, not Baras, to protect him. Vowrawn remarked that nothing else could be gained by maintaining the deception, unless the Wrath was truly no longer in league with Baras. It was only after the Sith defeated the real assassin that Vowrawn was convinced of the Wrath's sincerity of being Baras' enemy. Furthermore, Vowrawn believed that the two of them together could dethrone Baras, much to the Wrath's delight. He then confessed his true motive behind leading the Corellia campaign: significant and vulnerable pillars of Baras' his bid. One agent held secrets to use as leverage, the other led Jedi in campaigns against Sith who defied Baras. If they were to \"disappear,\" then Baras' support would be withdrawn. Vowrawn gave the Wrath the identity of the first spy, who was posing as Colonel Senks of the Corellia resistance. His stronghold in Labor Valley contained a myriad of escape tunnels, but Vowrawn passed the Wrath pulse disruptors that would lock Senks' secret passages so that he could be cornered and killed, though Vowrawn expressed regret that the Empire would lose a valuable agent. After arriving at the Wrath's ship, Vowrawn contacted his ally via holo, advising that if Senks wouldn't hand over his files, the Wrath should destroy his database to eliminate it all. After the deed was done, the Wrath had to leave the compound to avoid Baras eavesdropping on them.\nAfter the Wrath dealt with Senks, Vowrawn sent the Wrath to Axial Park, where his operative Shadow had gone to ground as Republic artillery bombarded the area. Shadow was supposed to provide the identity of Baras' Jedi spy. But upon meeting the Wrath, Shadow admitted that while he did not know the spy's identity, knew the location of the Jedi Enclave in the area. But while the Wrath fought through the Enclave to reveal the spy as Master Injaye, another unknown assailant made an attempt on Vowrawn, but with more fury than the last one. Vowrawn was impressed with how the Wrath's companions looked death in the eye and did not flinch.\nVowrawn later rejoined the Wrath in a safe house at the Capitol Square to free the Entity. However, Lord Draahg ambushed them before Vowrawn could begin releasing her bounds, imprisoning the Dark Councilor in a death field that threatened to disintegrate him. The Wrath finally killed Draahg and freed Vowrawn. Once freed, Vowrawn confessed that he expected to die. Before performing the ritual to free the Entity, he had her confirm that Baras was viewing what had transpired through her, guessing that he must be twisting with fury.\nWith Baras severely weakened, it was the time to finally expose him as the false Voice. Returning to Korriban, Vowrawn, arriving \"fashionably late,\" authorized the Emperor's Wrath's entry into the Dark Council Chambers in order to ensure the final confrontation between Master and apprentice. Vowrawn urged his fellow Dark Councilors to stay their hand as they were all victims of a ruse perpetrated by Baras. In turn, Baras tried to make a desperate attempt out of greed or jealousy and called on the Dark Council to assist him in destroying his former apprentice, promising that the Emperor have informed him of Vowrawn's fate. Nonetheless, the Dark Council acknowledged the Wrath being supported by Vowrawn and allowed the Emperor's Wrath to duel Darth Baras and slay him, thus ending his plans to attain ultimate power in the Sith Empire. Relieved to be rid of his rival, Vowrawn, speaking on behalf of the Council, declared that the Wrath had free rein and answerable only to their ultimate Master.\nSometime afterwards, Vowrawn was present for Darth Thanaton's appeal for the execution of his rival, Lord Kallig. However, the latter interrupted the appeal. The Dark Council, curious to see why Thanaton had been unable to kill his rival, allowed them to finish their Kaggath before them. When Kallig succeeded in overpowering Thanaton, Vowrawn joined the other present Dark Councilors to observe the humiliated Dark Lord, before Darth Mortis snapped his neck with the Force, killing him. Kallig then took Thanaton's seat on the Council, taking the name Darth Nox and Thanaton's position as head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.\nAfter the Battle of Corellia, the Dark Council met to discuss the successor to Darth Hadra's seat, since Hadra had died during the battle. Vowrawn supported Darth Marr's nomination of Darth Karrid, but after Mortis nominated Darth Gravus, Vowrawn suggested that the Council adjourn the meeting to ponder on the decision. When news arrived that Karrid had killed Gravus, the Council unanimously supported her nomination.\nVowrawn later made contact with the Wrath on Rishi and informed them that advanced Opticron droids were spying on the latter. He provides a device to unveil these drones and advised to do so in secluded spots. Vowrawn departed the planet soon after, as the Hand was pursuing him for attempting to uncover their secrets, going as far as interrogating a Servant.\nWhen the Eternal Empire invaded and conquered both the Sith Empire and the Republic, Vowrawn represented the Empire in pledging allegiance to Emperor Arcann alongside Senator Evran. By 3630 BBY, Vowrawn was serving as the Head of Civil Administration under Empress Darth Acina, who declared herself Empress of the Sith after the rest of the Dark Council died or disappeared.\nIn 3629 BBY, the Sith battled the Republic and Eternal Alliance for control of a powerful superweapon. During said battle, Empress Acina was driven mad and then killed by the superweapon. Vowrawn subsequently assumed the throne of the Sith Empire.\nA short time later, Vowrawn used an enslaved Darth Malgus to invade Ossus, marking the beginning of the third Galactic War against the Republic and the Jedi.\nEmperor Vowrawn convened a Dark Council meeting along with Darth Malgus to destroy the Meridian Complex on Corellia by sending Darth Savik to Onderon and Darth Shaar to Mek-Sha to destroy Republic fleet reinforcements that could hinder the Empire's assault.\nDarth Vowrawn was a charming and sophisticated elder statesman who in the Cold War had served on the Dark Council for decades—no small feat in the Empire, where the tenure of new council members was often measured in weeks. His passionate, almost hedonistic pursuit of challenge was well known among his peers, who learned never to underestimate his cutthroat enthusiasm. However, he did seem to genuinely care for his loyal bodyguards.\nVowrawn reveled in the game of conquest and Sith power plays, driven to euphoria by all the rich details of his favorite sport. Many upstart Sith had attempted to best Vowrawn over the years through a variety of strategies, from complex schemes to bluntly direct surprise attacks. Although some scored temporary victories, Vowrawn's talent for adjusting his strategy on the move had left him the final victor in all these confrontations. He led the attempt to block Baras from being named Voice of the Emperor, and succeeded with the aid of Baras's former apprentice, the Emperor's Wrath. He also had many estates on all of the major Sith worlds.\nAs the head of the Sphere of Production and Logistics, Vowrawn was excellent with numbers and was aware that the Empire was at a disadvantage to the Republic in terms of soldiers, resources, and allies. Like Darth Marr, he knew that the Empire needed to recruit more worlds to its side if it wanted to succeed in the war against the Republic. He also seemed to be against the Empire's anti-alien policies, a sentiment shared with Darth Marr. This was demonstrated clearly when he supported Darth Karrid's ascension to the Dark Council after the death of Darth Hadra and Karrid killed Darth Gravus, as well as when he took an alien apprentice.\nHe was knowledgeable in ancient Sith rituals and magics, which was how he released the Entity from her imprisonment.\nGiven his quick defeat at the hands of Lord Draahg and his assumption that he stood little chance against the Emperor's Wrath, it's probable that age had withered his combat abilities by the time of the Cold War. However, his true talents were in his formidable charm and cunning, successfully disguising himself as a Republic asset during the battle of Corellia and orchestrating the downfall of Darth Baras, not to mention remaining a member of the Dark Council longer than any of his peers.\nIf the Sith Warrior is a Pureblood Sith, upon meeting, Vowrawn remarks that he'll at least die by the hands of his own species. During the Sith Warrior Quest Line \"Protect Vowrawn,\" there is a stage where a bounty hunter hired by Baras tries to eliminate Vowrawn. After defeating the assassin, the Emperor's Wrath gains the Codex Entry \"Darth Vowrawn,\" yet when you open the Codex, Vowrawn is portrayed as having orange eyes, whereas in-game, he has red eyes.\nVowrawn is seen paying tribute to Arcann in Chapter II of Knights of the Fallen Empire, but in Chapter III, Lana states that Darth Acina was the only Dark Councilor not dead or absent. Following Chapter II of Knights of the Eternal Throne, the player will receive an in-game mail from him, proving that he is alive and serving under Empress Acina.\nIn Game Update 5.2: War For Iokath, if the player sides with the Empire, and later chooses to monitor their allies to find a traitor, the monitors mention Acina sending messages to Vowrawn, and he becomes a suspect. If Acina was killed during the Iokath storyline, a news broadcast in the flashpoint \"A Traitor Among the Chiss\" states that Vowrawn ascended to the throne, now dubbed Emperor Vowrawn.\nAn Imperial Loyalist or Republic Saboteur player is given the opportunity to have Lana Beniko kill both Darth Shaar and him on Mek-Sha. However, this is only the case if Acina is the Empress. If Vowrawn is Emperor, only Shaar can be killed, as he will not be present on Mek-Sha.\nDuring the Legacy of the Sith storyline for Imperial players, Emperor Vowrawn appears at the conclusion of the Ruins of Nul story flashpoint to assist in restraining Darth Malgus while being accompanied by two Dark Honor Guards. If the player supported the Empire on Iokath then Empress Acina appears instead.",
