 "content": "Tae Boon was a male Twi'lek who served as a second in command to Cham Syndulla of the Twi'lek Resistance during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tae Boon served with Cham Syndulla in the Twi'lek Resistance, fighting to free their planet from Separatist control. Eventually, their resistance movement joined forces with the Grand Army of the Republic's Lightning Squadron. When Boon's blurrg nipped at the fingers of the ARF trooper \"Stak,\" he told him in Twi'leki that his blurrg may be short-tempered, but that she was faster than his AT-RT. He later teased one of the passing ARF troopers, telling him to \"try and keep up\" on his AT-RT while he himself rode his blurrg into battle.\nTae Boon was voiced by James Arnold Taylor.",
