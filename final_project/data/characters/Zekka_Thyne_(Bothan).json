 "content": "Zekka Thyne was a Bothan criminal with Prince Xizor's Black Sun organization. He could be found in Coronet on Corellia. He sent a spacer to kill Wililikin and Wedu Belar in 1 ABY.\nZekka Thyne appears as a non-player characters offering missions in Star Wars Galaxies, a Star Wars Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game  released for the pc.\nIt can be assumed that Zekka Thyne was intended to be Zekka Thyne, a mixture of Human and an unknown alien species who appeared in X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble and Side Trip. Galaxies, however, classes him as a Bothan, and his appearance is nothing like that character on which he is based. Thus, it cannot be canonically said that the two are the same, though it was most likely the game designer's intention, as Galaxies possesses several other continuity errors.",
