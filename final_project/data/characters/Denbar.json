 "content": "Denbar was a Human male who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nDenbar appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, he would have been a herald NPC which directed players to the Nightsister Rancor Cave on Dathomir. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
