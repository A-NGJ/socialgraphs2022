 "content": "Lowan was the smug student leader of Lara Notsil's training group at New Republic pilot school. He was given the duty of informing Notsil that she had been transferred to Colonel Atton Repness's Screaming Wookiee training squadron for remedial pilot training.\nNotsil, actually an undercover Gara Petothel, knew that she could outfly him on the worst of her days in the cockpit; She decided, however, not to continue her verbal bout with him or to shoot an imaginary target on his head as she would have liked, but to go about her mission so as to return as an Imperial pilot and have the chance to vape him in a dogfight.",
