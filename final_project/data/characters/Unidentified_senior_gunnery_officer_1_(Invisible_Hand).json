 "content": "A Neimoidian served as a gunnery officer aboard General Grievous's flagship, Invisible Hand. The officer was present on the ship during the Battle of Coruscant. He was killed by Grievous when he attempted to protest that the forward batteries of Invisible Hand would soon be at critical failure, by smashing the officer's face with his fist. He promptly ripped the officer's corpse out of its chair and promoted the nearest officer to the deceased one's position.",
