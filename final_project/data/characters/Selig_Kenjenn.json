 "content": "Selig Kenjenn was a Human male Jedi Knight who served as a member of the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In 22 BBY, he was one of Mace Windu's Jedi strike team sent to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padm√© Amidala during the First Battle of Geonosis. Kenjenn wielded two lightsabers and was not listed among the casualties.\nKenjenn did not appear in the movie Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, or any Expanded Universe stories surrounding the Battle of Geonosis. He is a creation of Hasbro, released in a battle pack in 2013 with fellow Jedi Que-Mars Redath and Khaat Qiyn, as well as Clone captain Deviss.\nIn promotional art for Kenjenn , he is seen with 2 Jedi, tie fighters flying in the background, a Star Destroyer also visible, and stormtrooper blasters can be seen, implying he survived the First Battle of Geonosis and the Clone Wars.\nKenjenn's likeness was based on Leland Chee, the Keeper of the Holocron continuity database. Chee himself established on his Facebook page that Kenjenn is the same character as a Jedi with Chee's likeness from an earlier, unofficial illustration of Chee as a Jedi by Joe Corroney.",
