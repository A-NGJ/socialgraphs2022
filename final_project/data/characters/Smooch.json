 "content": "Smooch was a female Tarasin. She was seen in Depatar, the City of Masks, in 31 BBY. Like all the visitors and many inhabitants, she was in disguise, particularly with a mask of Caarite and a costume covered with the repeated word \"Oink\". The frisky Smooch was having a good time dancing and smooching anything not fast enough to escape.",
