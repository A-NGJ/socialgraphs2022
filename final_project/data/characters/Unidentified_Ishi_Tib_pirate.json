 "content": "An Ishi Tib pirate was a member of the Ohnaka Gang during the Clone Wars. The pirate was skeptical of Hondo Ohnaka's leadership skills and intelligence, as when told to attack a nearby ship, the Crucible, he commented that he believed Hondo wasn't going to \"mess\" with Jedi anymore. He was later sucked into space along with the other pirates by Ahsoka Tano, though likely survived, as the majority of the other pirates did.\nThis pirate was designed by Chris Glenn according to Star Wars.com's concept art gallery. This pirate was also based on a design created for the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi.",
