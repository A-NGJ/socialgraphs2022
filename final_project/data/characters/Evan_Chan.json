 "content": "Evan Chan was a male Human who was employed as a hydrologist for the Galactic Republic.\nAlthough his work meant that he had to travel to many worlds in order to analyze the quality of oceans, rivers and lakes across the galaxy, Chan hated the prospect of extrasolar travel via hyperspace. He typically tried to dull his anxiety by partaking in alcoholic beverages.\nWhile nervously awaiting passage from Coruscant to his latest assignment, he witnessed the Jedi Master Yoda, disguised as an R2-series astromech droid, evade another such unit working as security detail for the Chancellor Palpatine Spaceport. The odd way that the old master accomplished this task made Chan swear off drinking SomnaSkol Red completely.",
