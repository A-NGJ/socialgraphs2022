 "content": "Tallamitta was a male brown-haired member of the Wookiee species. He wore a piece of clothing that covered his chest, and wielded a bowcaster, a projectile weapon used by many Wookiees.\nTallamitta first appeared in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. The character was available for use in the scenario editor, where players could create levels, but had no involvement in the story campaigns. Tallamitta's name could also appear as a leader representing an AI player controlling the Wookiee faction in the standard game mode. The profile image shown when the player selects Tallamitta is identical to the image used for the character Shoran, while Tallamitta's in-game appearance is shared with the Wookiee bowcaster trooper unit.",
