 "content": "A girl was the firstborn daughter of Talzin, matriarch and shaman of the Nightsister coven on the planet Dathomir. Talzin claimed that, while giving birth to this girl, she was struck with a fatal affliction. She nearly died in childbirth, but after having a vision of the Other Realm, she was saved by the Spiritsâ€”a mythological embodiment of the Force.\nTalzin's firstborn daughter was mentioned in the 2012 reference book, Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side, written by Daniel Wallace and published by Chronicle Books. In his endnotes for the Book of Sith, Wallace said he mapped the events of Talzin's biography, specifically the birth of her daughter, against the real-world traditions of shamanism.",
