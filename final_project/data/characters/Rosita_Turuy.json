 "content": "Rosita Turuy was a female human Imperial cadet who attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. She disliked aliens and sought to push the Chiss Thrawn out of the Academy.\nRosita Turuy was a human female born by 24 BBY. As a cadet at Coruscant's Royal Imperial Academy, she encountered the Chiss Thrawn, an alien from the Unknown Regions whom she disliked.\nLike many Academy students and faculty, Turuy exhibited the Galactic Empire's unofficial but prevalent xenophobia. She conspired with Spenc Orbar and other cadets to force Thrawn out of the Academy. They invited Thrawn to the metallurgy lab to gamble, hoping he would be caught violating the Academy's anti-gambling policy. However, Thrawn brandished a lieutenant's rank plaque the Academy's Commandant Deenlark gave him; demonstrating his permission to be there. An instructor arrived to catch and punish Thrawn and Eli Vanto, but upon seeing Thrawn's lieutenant plaque, left them to their activities.\nTuruy and her co-conspirators resorted to physically attacking Thrawn. The Chiss bested his attackers and observed that they displayed tremendous aptitude as fighter pilots. Thrawn and Vanto reported the attack to Deenlark, and Thrawn recommended the assailants be transferred to Skystrike Academy rather than face expulsion. Deenlark, eager not to cross the cadets' wealthy parents, granted Thrawn's request, leaving the other assailants unaware and paranoid about their friends' fate. The attackers left Vanto and Thrawn alone after that.\nRosita Turuy appeared in the 2017 novel Thrawn by Timothy Zahn. She was pictured in the first installment of that novel's 2018 comic adaptation.",
