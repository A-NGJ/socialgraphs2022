 "content": "Titus Sypknee was a Human male assassin who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Titus Sypknee worked as the bodyguard of the Whiphid crime lord Lady Valarian.\nIn 1 ABY, a lab assistant from the Mos Eisley Biolab, Bera Jeza, was assassinated in a street of Mos Eisley. Since she had ties with the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, his majordomo Bib Fortuna hired a spacer to investigate the murder. Working with the Slicer Cale Herron, the spacer was not able to find the assassin. As Fortuna urged the spacer to solve the case, Herron suggested to blame Lady Valarian, Jabba's rival on Tatooine, for the murder. The spacer therefore visited Lady Valarian at the Lucky Despot, in Mos Eisley, and accused the crime lord in the name of Jabba. Indeed, Lady Valarian was not eager to be held responsible for a murder she did not order. Valarian then ordered Titus Sypknee to get rid of the spacer. The assassin attacked the spacer but the latter managed to kill Sypknee. The spacer eventually forced Lady Valarian to pay reparations to Jabba the Hutt.\nTitus Sypknee appeared as a dead non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Titus Sypknee was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13,\" released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong,\" an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.\nIn the game, Titus Sypknee was a hostile elite NPC who could only be defeated by a group of players. However, killing Sypknee was not required to complete the questline. In fact, if the player was killed, he/she was respawned at the nearest cloning center and received a communication from Jabba declaring that Boba Fett would take care of Titus Sypknee.",
