 "content": "Quin was a Bivall female Nihil marauder and slicer who was a Cloud in the Tempest led by Tempest Runner Lourna Dee. After Dee's flagship, the Lourna Dee, came under attack by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order during the Battle of Galov, Quin was one of the Nihil who were captured and imprisoned on the prison ship Restitution. Aboard the Restitution, Quin met Tasia, a Storm within the same Tempest, as well as Dee herself, who had been captured without the Republic or Jedi being aware of her true identity. Tasia, who wished to use her knowledge of Dee's identity against her, later revealed the secret to Quin.\nQuin was voiced by Shannon Tyo in the 2021 audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, written by Cavan Scott. She was subsequently first pictured in the tenth issue of the comic series Star Wars: The High Republic.",
