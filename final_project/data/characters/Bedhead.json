 "content": "Bedhead was a tame kusak that lived on Lok at the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, the beast was part of a pack of ten kusaks, including Runt, Blinky, Scarecrow, Slobbers, Troubles, Wart Face, Gargle, Ding and Speedbump, trained by the Lok Revenants to guard Nym's Stronghold. In 1 ABY, an adventurer fed the creature with Lokkian weed. Bedhead only liked a special kind of weed, so the adventurer had to collect and try different plants to find the one Bedhead preferred.\nBedhead appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Bedhead was added to the game as part of the revamped \"Nym's Theme Park\", released with the \"Game Update 16\", on March 23, 2010.\nThe kusak was part of the \"Caring for the Kusaks\" collection. Each time a player finished the \"Weed Whacker Foliage Requisition\" quest, the player was rewarded with one of ten different kinds of Lokian weed. These could be used to feed the kusaks, but each of the ten different kusaks in or near the stronghold only accepted one randomly determined kind of weed.",
