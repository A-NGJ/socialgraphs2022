 "content": "Gleb was a female Aqualish who served as headmaster of the Future Imperial Leaders Military Preparatory School on Vardos. She taught the notion that young Imperials didn't make friends, they instead made allies but more than colleagues. During Operation: Cinder, Admiral Garrick Versio ordered Inferno Squad to rescue Gleb from Vardos' destruction.\nThirty years later, she was deeply involved in Project Resurrection of the First Order, who helped Jinata Security maintain control over the Jinata system and rebuilt Vardos. Unfortunately, Gleb's indolence allowed Del Meeko to discover their plans, prompting dark warrior Kylo Ren to mind probe him for intel on the map to Luke Skywalker and have Commander Gideon Hask shoot him dead. She buried Del Meeko and his crew on the latter's instructions, but left the Corvus functional, while promising him that her men would triple operations on Athulla, while relocating the Pillio operation. Gleb was later killed on Vardos by the displeased Hask for repeated failures regarding Project Resurrection, falling behind schedule and having \"outlived her usefulness.\" After her unceremonious demise, the Commander ordered the destruction of Kestro, which resulted in all-out battle between Jinata Security and their former ally, the First Order.\nGleb first appeared in the novel Battlefront II: Inferno Squad, written by Christie Golden and published by Del Rey.",
