 "content": "Lawadaa was a male Wookiee, who embraced a criminal carrier. An accomplished smuggler he operated during the Galactic Civil War and was also a fair pilot.\nAlthough not a bad guy, Lawadaa was incarcerated on Talman III after a brawl, which made him quite furious. Enjailed next to the target of an Alliance to Restore the Republic operation, the Wookiee was ready to impersonate the thief if freedom was promised to him.\nAn average Wookiee, Lawadaa had a dark brown fur, partially burn by blaster shots. It is not known if those burns were caused by the brawl which earned him his incarceration.\nLawadaa was created by Jean Balczesak for the ambiguously canon roleplaying scenario \"Hold-up galactique\" which appeared in the French magazine Casus Belli 62. He actually doesn't have any written role in the story, other than being one of the potential candidate for the thief known as \"the Rat\".",
