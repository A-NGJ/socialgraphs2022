 "content": "Kweeta was a male Rodian who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKweeta appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Kweeta would have been in some way involved with the 2005 expansion pack, Trials of Obi-Wan. However, Kweeta is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
