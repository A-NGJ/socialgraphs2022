 "content": "Talrin Youp was a Bith female from Clak'dor VII who worked as a computer programmer and professor during her lifetime. After traveling the galaxy as a technical specialist, she returned with her technical knowledge to become a professor teaching Bith technology at Nozho University in the city of Nozho on Clak'dor VII. While Youp was the default professor providing instruction on Bith technology to non-Bith students, the overall learning structure at the school caused these students to dropout at a rate or over ninety percent.\nOriginally from the Bith homeworld of Clak'dor VII, Talrin Youp spent a portion of her life traveling through the galaxy as a technical specialist and computer programmer in a similar fashion to millions of other members of the Bith species. She eventually returned to Clak'dor to find work as a teacher and ending up becoming a technology professor at Nozho University, the largest university on the planet. While teaching at the university, which was located in the city of Nozho, Youp's significant knowledge of different languages made her the default choice for teaching the large numbers of non-Bith students about Bith technology. While many non-Bith attended Nozho University, the learning structure at the school caused over ninety percent of those students to washout before graduation. However, Youp was able to explain complicated technology such as hyperdrive circuity clearly in ways that novices could understand.\nTalrin Youp was an extremely intelligent individual who was knowledgeable about different forms of technology and adept at giving detail explanations to people without large amounts of technical knowledge. However, her lack of social skills made it difficult for her to determine if an individual wanted to participate in an in-depth discussion or not, which caused her to unknowingly bore people she conversed with. While Youp was a staunch pacifist like most Bith, she would selectively fight with a stun baton if forced into combat, although she preferred to avoid combat when possible.\nDue to her experience as an itinerant technical guru, Youp had a vast knowledge of different forms of technology. She was highly skilled in constructing and programming computers and was able to easily repair or disable mechanical devices. Additionally the Bith professor was adept at compiling information through research and careful examination. While she was able to master a large number of languages, she was only marginally skilled in negotiation. Youp was fluent and literate in Bith, Basic, Durese, Ithorese, and Sullustese, while she was literate in Shyriiwook. In addition to her technical skills, Talrin Youp was a capable pilot and was skilled at astrogation. She was also marginally skilled at playing a kloo horn. Despite her pacifist nature, she was able to use simple melee weapons such as stun batons and was versed in the use of blaster pistols.\nDuring her time as a professor at Nozho University, Youp carried a datapad and a stun baton.\nTalrin Youp is featured in Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds, a 2004 sourcebook written by Craig R. Carey, Jason Fry, Jeff Quick, and Daniel Wallace, for the revised edition of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The Bith professor is a non-player character featured in the section of the book about Clak'dor VII. As Talrin Youp is intended to be usable as a non-player character in any era, it is impossible to determine the timeframe when she was alive.",
