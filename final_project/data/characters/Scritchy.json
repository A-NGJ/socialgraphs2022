 "content": "Scritchy was a pet rakling owned by Doctor Eckard Lokin during his retirement on Alderaan. A former Kowakian monkey-lizard, Scritchy and the other raklings treated by Lokin were infected with a customized stain of the rakghoul plague, making them sterile and relatively harmless. After being recruited into the Alliance against Zakuul in 3631 BBY, Lokin took Scritchy with him to the Alliance base on Odessen.\nScritchy appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire after the completion of Eckard Lokin Alliance alert mission.",
