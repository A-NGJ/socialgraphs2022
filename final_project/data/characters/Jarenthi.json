In 3636 BBY he was stationed on Ziost when former Sith Emperor Vitiate came to the world and possessed many of the Imperials on the planet, turning them into his puppets to murder civilians. Jarenthi was among those who fell under his control and he was killed during the fighting.\nQuartermaster Jarenthi was added to Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan in game update 3.2.",
