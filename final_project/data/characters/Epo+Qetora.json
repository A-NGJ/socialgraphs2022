 "content": "Epo Qetora was a male Twi'lek historian who was present at the Mensix Mining Facility on Mustafar during the Galactic Civil War in 1 ABY\nIn 1 ABY, while doing research on Mustafar, Epo befriended an unknown spacer who was visiting the volcanic planet. He hired the spacer to infiltrate an Old Republic facility on the planet and download the facilities database so that Epo could research it. The spacer entered the facility only to find it overrun with murderous droids and ancient, vicious animals. Many battles later, the spacer was successful and brought the data disk from the facility back to Epo. The spacer was rewarded with a copy of the disk, and a specialized, armored helmet with enhancements to increase the user's accuracy.\nSometime later, Epo hired the same spacer to investigate a series of Jedi ruins on the planet, to locate various tablets hidden within. The ruins were located in an area known as Berken's Flow. After finding two of the tablets beneath a pile of rocks and on a corpse, the spacer was attacked by nearby scavengers and a dark Jedi named Skar. Defeating them, the spacer recovered the last two tablets from their corpses and returned them to Epo. Overjoyed, Epo rewarded the spacer with a second history disk and three weapons, a Coynite rifle, pistol, and carbine.\nEpo Qetora was a non-playable character in the massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He, along with the planet Mustafar, were added to the game in the late 2005 expansion pack, Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan.",
