 "content": "Jitt was a female Jawa that lived and served as a Chief Mechanic on the planet Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nSeveral months prior to the Battle of Yavin, Jitt met the GNK-series power droid EG-30. The two instantly formed a connection, and would spend the coming months sharing nearly all their time together.\nKnowing that her fellow Jawas would eventually want to sell EG-30, Jitt installed a device inside her friend that would blow his primary motivator, as no one would desire to buy a faulty droid. When the Jawas put EG-30 up for sale to a moisture farmer, Jitt was prepared to activate the device, but had a change of heart when she saw the farmer's daughter embrace the droid with a hug. She allowed the Jawas to sell the droid, wanting her friend to be a part of a family.",
