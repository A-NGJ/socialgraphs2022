 "content": "Lonaste was a female Ugnaught miner who lived in Ugnaught Town on Bespin during the Galactic Civil War. From the intercepted messages and warnings, she concluded that the Empire would take control of the city. She warned the Ugnaught clans but they didn't believe her. When the Imperials arrived and began taking control of the city, she and her clan worked to escape. She and her cousin Beetase went to the platforms to find a spaceship. Yoxgit followed to shoot them, because he agreed with the Empire's lines claiming to supply them miners and he disagreed with Lonaste's clan. Before he could, one of Lonaste's aunts hit him unconscious so they could safely leave the planet.",
