 "content": "Makos was a Human male in the Arkinnea Militia. In 19 BBY, he was a crewmember on an ore carrier that was supposedly ferrying refugees to a secondary outpost, but was secretly disposing of them by dropping them to their deaths. On one of these runs, Makos was sent to check for any refugees still clinging to the ship. While he did not find any, he instead spotted the group of Jedi led by Jedi Master Zao and Jedi Knight K'Kruhk. The Militia opened fire on the group, but they managed to escape into the forest. K'Kruhk would later pull the carrier into the ground, resulting in a massive explosion that presumably ended Makos' life.",
