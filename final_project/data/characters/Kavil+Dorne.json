 "content": "Kavil Dorne was a Human member of the Dorne family, a prestigious military family in the society of the reconstituted Sith Empire. Kavil Dorne served as a training officer for the Empire's Imperial Intelligence division.\nKavil Dorne was mentioned in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia. Dorne shares a surname and rank with Vasil Dorne, a character from the accompanying video game, BioWare's Star Wars: The Old Republic of 2011, who appears in the Imperial Agent storyline, but Vasil Dorne's dialogue does not include the quote from the Encyclopedia, and thus it is unclear whether the name \"Kavil\" was a misspelling or intended as a separate character.",
