Stationed with General Jan Dodonna at the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4 prior to 0 BBY's Battle of Yavin, Morett had final launch authority in the base's hangar and managed ground crews.\nResponsible for preparing Red and Gold Squadron starships for battle, Morett and his ground crews worked quickly to prepare the squadrons before the Battle of Yavin. Right before the battle, Morett was adding fuel to one of the starfighters as the Rebel pilots were departing. The battle ended with the Alliance destroying the Imperial DS-1 Orbital Battle Station above Yavin 4. Morett wore a gray jumpsuit.\nFirin Morett first appeared in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first film of the original trilogy.
