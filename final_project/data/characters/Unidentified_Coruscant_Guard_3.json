 "content": "A clone served as a shock trooper with Coruscant Guard during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists. He was stationed at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center in Galactic City on Coruscant.\nAround 21 BBY, when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised himself as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and infiltrated the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center to uncover a plot to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, this clone trooper was on guard in the detention facility's mess hall along with many other clone shock trooper guards.\nAfter the undercover Jedi became involved in a fight with fellow prisoner Boba Fett, two troopers tried to stop them but were overpowered by Trandoshan prisoner Bossk. Moments after, this trooper and three others arrived and tried to subdue Bossk, but failed, and a prison riot ensued.\nThe clone first appeared in the fifteenth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' fourth season, titled \"Deception\". He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, the actor who portrays all of the clone troopers in the series.",
