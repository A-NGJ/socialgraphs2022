 "content": "Bon Sequors was a dashing Human male who dressed in fine clothing and wore a blue cape. Sequors was sympathetic to the Alliance, but was not an official member. He had many friends who were, and as such tended to help them out as much as possible.\nSequors pulled off a heist against the crime lord Randar Dowellin, stealing a valuable collection of Galactic Republic artifacts including a rare Karltonian Fiskin coin. In an effort to avoid the bounty hunters sent after him, Sequors headed to the Farrimmer Cafe on the Mynock 7 Space Station.",
