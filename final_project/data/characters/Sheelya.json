 "content": "Sheelya was a Human female who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSheelya appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Sheelya would have been in some way involved with the Legacy Quest. However, Sheelya is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
