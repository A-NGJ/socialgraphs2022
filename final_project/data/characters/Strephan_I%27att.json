 "content": "Strephan I'att was a Human male who was the co-founder of I'att Armament, along with his wife, Augusta in Il Avali, Druckenwell during the Galactic Civil War. With a length of Imperial service under his belt, that was precisely whom he sold his weapons to.\nThe most significant creation of his was an anti-energy field prototype co-developed with the lover of his granddaughter Tinian.\nI'att was planning to retire to Geridard with his wife when the successful presentation of the invention prompted Moff Kerioth to order the family to Doldur where he could directly oversee the manufacture of the technology with the intent on personally passing it on to Emperor Palpatine as his own. When Strephan refused, he was executed alongside his wife by the Moff's stormtrooper escort.",
