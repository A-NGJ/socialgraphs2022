 "content": "Talena Ancia was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. Wielding two lightsabers in combat, she was one of the commanders of the Republic forces on the planet Voss.\nMaster Talena Ancia was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of the Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Strongholds, which added Conquest Commanders to most of the dual-faction worlds. Ancia is a rare NPC enemy, and her place at Kri-Ta Outpost on Voss is frequently occupied by a generic Veteran Jedi Battlemaster. However, her character model is glitched; she is incorrectly generated as wearing the male version of the outfit used by female Jedi Conquest Commanders. As a result, the outfit is far too large, and only the top of her head—for which hair is not generated, as the outfit is hooded—can be seen.",
