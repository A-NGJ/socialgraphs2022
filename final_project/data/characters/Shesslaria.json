 "content": "Shesslaria was a human female skip tracer who was a member of the Interstellar Collections Limited and the credit recovery division of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Her Undervine nullstring was 049x88108. She obtained Smuggler's Guide from the smuggler Han Solo, who grazed her arm with a needlebeamer. Later, on the route from Ord Mantell to Zorba's palace in the Southern Rim, transporting her target, she was worried a hunt saboteur could have picked up her approach vector, so she used untraveled hyperlanes. Her worry was realized when hunt saboteur Puttana Pin intercepted her during the stop on Jedha, Putanna rescued her target and stole the logbook from her.\nShesslaria was first mentioned in Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and released in 2018.",
