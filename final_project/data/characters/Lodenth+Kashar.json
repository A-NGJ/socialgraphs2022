 "content": "Lodenth Kashar was a Duros male who served in the military of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War. He held no official rank and as such his duties were flexible. His work primarily consisted of assisting Watchers in analyzing reports as well as providing psychological profiling of alien behavior patterns. He was involved with Cipher Nine, and aided the hunt for domestic terrorists on Dromund Kaas, to include hunting Darth Jadus's killer.",
