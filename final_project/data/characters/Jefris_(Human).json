 "content": "Jefris was a Human male who served as commander of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.\nShortly after the Battle of Kothlis around 21 BBY, Jefris returned to his hangar on Coruscant until he realized that his men were not at their posts. When he searched the hangar, he discovered that Jedi General Anakin Skywalker was the one who ordered Jefris's men to take a break without the commander's permission. Jefris was enraged and argued with Skywalker since he didn't have the right to order his men to leave their posts.",
