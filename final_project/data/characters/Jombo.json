 "content": "Jombo was a male Rodian hunter and criminal. Around 8 ABY, after learning that the crime lord Gamgalon was organizing safaris on Varonat to cover a gunrunning operation, Jombo joined Gamgalon's criminal organization. He said little, keeping his opinions to himself.\nJombo appears briefly in Timothy Zahn's short story First Contact, which was published in 1994's Star Wars Adventure Journal 1 by West End Games. The extra background material was written by Peter M. Schweighofer. Because Jombo's name only appeared in the supplementary information, the character was not referred to by name when the story was reprinted in Tales from the Empire or on Hyperspace, as neither reproduced the RPG material that accompanied the original story.",
