 "content": "Rex Geer was a male Human who served as the leader of Suudaa Nem'ro's street gang in Jiguuna on the planet Nal Hutta during the Cold War.\nDuring the Cold War, Rex Geer was involved in leading Nem'ro's forces in an ongoing rivalry between his boss and the Hutt Voontara Fa'athra. During one particular battle between the two forces, he captured four prisoners, one of which was a deserter of Nem'ro's gang. This deserter was Cam Brell, the younger brother of Lew Brell, who had left the same gang years ago.\nAfter Lew sent an imperial-aligned individual to rescue Cam from the life of crime, Rex offered to pay off the individual if they would allow Cam to remain in his custody to be taken before Nem'ro. The individual accepted Rex's offer, leaving the deserter to his fate.\nThe player has the option of rejecting Rex's offer of credits and demand Cam be returned on the condition that he and his brother leave Hutta immediately and permanently. Rex will reluctantly agree after much convincing, and Cam will enthusiastically thank his rescuer.",
