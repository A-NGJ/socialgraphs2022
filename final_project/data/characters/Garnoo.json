 "content": "Garnoo was an ancient Neti Jedi Master. One of his most famous apprentices was Oss Wilum, a participant in the infamous Sith War, though Oss had just begun his training when Garnoo realized his time was coming to an end. To make sure Oss' training was seen through to the finish, he asked Jedi Master Thon if he would take Oss on as his student. When Garnoo's life finally did come to an end, Thon respected the wishes of his old friend and, seeing great potential in Oss, accepted him as his Padawan.\nGarnoo lived a long life, and had an illustrious career among the Jedi, working to defend what the Order believed in, and later to train many Jedi Knights to carry on that tradition.",
