 "content": "Cathea was a young Human female whose parents went to Ylesia as \"pilgrims\" with her.\nDuring the Battle of Ylesia, which took place during the Galactic Civil War, Cathea and other children such as Kryss P'teska, Aeron and Tym were abandoned by their parents who have been enthralled by the Exultation. Cathea and the children hid together in a basement and were eventually found by Han Solo and Chewbacca after the raid.\nSince the building was set to explode through demolition bombs in only a matter of minutes, the rescuers had no other option but to take them with themselves.\nWhereas Han Solo intended to drop the children off at the next spaceport, Chewbacca advocated for taking them to Corellia.\nHaving been tasked by the Hutt Jabba Desilijic Tiure to bring a load of spice from Kessel to Tatooine, they were discovered by an Imperial patrol. Cathea and three other children helped Han to jettison the illegal cargo in order to evade arrest. The Smuggler convinced the Imperials that he was taking the children to Corellia. Since the Captain Tybert Capucot insisted to escort them, the Millennium Falcon dropped the children off at Corellia, thus returning Cathea back to her homeplanet.",
