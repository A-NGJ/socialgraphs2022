 "content": "Besaama was a female Tarasin who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nWhen Besaama was twelve, she discovered the Tree, a tree that was used as a base by the Wyrd, while walking home through the jungles of Cularin. She entered the tree and two days later, she re-emerged as a member of the Wyrd, having given in the dark side of the Force. Besaama was later redeemed and she abandoned the dark side.",
