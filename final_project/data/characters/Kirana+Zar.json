 "content": "Kirana Zar was a female Human bounty hunter who was active during the Galactic War. She could often be found on Vaiken Spacedock, selling gear to other hunters.\nKirana Zar first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Columi Gear vendor for the Bounty Hunter class. During a restructuring of the game's gear system in Game Update 2.0, she was changed to a Basic Gear vendor. She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
