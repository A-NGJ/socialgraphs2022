 "content": "Herman Pate was a Human male who lived during the Galactic Civil War. He lived at Dee'ja Peak on Naboo. In 1 ABY, he won a ring from Vance Groten during a Sabacc game. Pate later gave the ring to Janelle, a smuggler leader, to pay a debt. As the ring was a family heirloom, Groten later tried to pay Pate to recover the ring but it was not in his own anymore. Vance Groten finally dispatched a spacer to find the smuggler leader Janelle and get the ring back.\nHerman Pate appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Herman Pate was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
