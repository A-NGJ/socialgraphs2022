 "content": "Two-Blade was a clone of a Force-sensitive male human that was created in an Imperial research facility on a frozen moon in the Unknown Regions.\nIn 41 ABY, Two-Blade was a Human clone of a Force-sensitive that was created by the Galactic Empire in a research facility on a frozen moon in the Unknown Regions, as part of a cloning program that was initiated by Grand Admiral Thrawn along many other, although it was unknown who was his genetic template.\nLater, the newly constituted Community killed and overthrew the Imperial forces that operated the research facility. For many years, Two-Blade and all the clones resided on the moon and only in 41.5 ABY, they escaped the facility by stealing a CloakShape fighter that had been flown to the moon by the Anzat Sith agent Kell Douro but unfortunately Alpha was killed by the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr.\nTwo-Blade and all of the other members of the Community, with the exception of the clone Soldier, suffered from a sickness as a result of their clone heritage and as they escaped from the research facility, the CloakShape passed through the remnants of the Lignan cargo of the Sith dreadnaught Harbinger, which had been destroyed a short time earlier. The Lignan enhanced the clones' perception of the Force and accelerated the effects of their sickness.\nBadly sick but still alive Two-Blade survived until they arrived on Fhost where he was left behind on the starship with the corpses of deceased clones as the survivors fled in order to obtained some medication and a new medical starship. Succumbing to the disease, he was killed by Nyss Nenn with a knife right in the chest, while the latter and his sister, broke into the vessel during their quest to find Soldier for the One Sith.\nTwo-Blade possibly received that nickname for his skill with Jar'Kai, which had him stand out from the rest of the Community.",
