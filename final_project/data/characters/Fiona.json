 "content": "Fiona was a human female who worked at an underground mining colony on an airless moon in the Outer Rim Territories. She was married to Ryland, and they had a daughter named Laina. When her daughter was six months old, Fiona was framed by a coworker, Corbin, for being a rebel spy, and killed. After her death, her husband and daughter were spirited to safety by relatives. Two years after Fiona's death, her husband had a hologram of her that he kept for their daughter.",
