 "content": "Erikson was a male Mon Calamari merchant who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he worked as a junk dealer on Station Gamma, a space station in the Bright Jewel system. As Station Gamma had been overran by the Rak'qua, a tribe of bellicose Nautolans, Erikson preferred to stay in the neutral area at the entrance of the station. There, he used to buy droid parts, old weapons and various other things from brave spacers who survived their exploration of Station Gamma.\nErikson appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Erikson was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
