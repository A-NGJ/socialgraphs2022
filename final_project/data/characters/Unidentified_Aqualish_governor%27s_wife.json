 "content": "An Aqualish female was married to an Aqualish governor during the Clone Wars. She and her husband attended a gala on Raxus Secundus that was held in honor of Confederate leader Count Dooku, the recipient of the Raxian Humanitarian Award. Her husband was speaking to Dooku when the Count's former apprentice, Asajj Ventress, approached him and challenged him to a duel after the gala. Afterwards, Dooku told the governor that the honor was all his in response to a greeting, before turning to greet his wife. She was overcome with shyness, ducking her head.\nThe governor's wife first appeared in the 2015 novel Dark Disciple, written by Christie Golden, an adaptation of an arc of Star Wars: The Clone Wars that went unmade thanks to the series' cancellation.",
