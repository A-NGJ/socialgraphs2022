 "content": "Kisha was a Human female dancer who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nKisha appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Kisha would have been in some way involved with the Secrets of the Syren questline. However, Kisha is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
