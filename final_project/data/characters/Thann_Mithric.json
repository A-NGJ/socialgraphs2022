 "content": "Thann Mithric was a male Falleen who served as a Jedi Knight in the time following the resolution of the Swarm War. At the beginning of the Second Galactic Civil War he was constantly chastised by Kolir Hu'lya for using his Falleen pheromones along with Jedi mind tricks. He served as part of the team, along with Jaina Solo, Zekk, and Hu'lya that attempted to kidnap Aidel Saxan as part of Operation Roundabout. However, it turned out to be a trap and Zekk received burns on his back while Kolir suffered a broken jaw. Thann was not injured badly.\nThann accompanied Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, fellow Jedi Knights Kolir Hu'lya and Valin Horn and Jedi apprentice Seha Dorvald on a mission in the underlevels of Coruscant to seek out Jacen Solo, now Darth Caedus. During the duel between the Jedi and Caedus, Kyle was severely wounded by a stab he received in the chest and was taken to safety by Seha. Kolir, Valin and Thann carried on fighting Caedus, which resulted in Thann taking a blaster wound to the chest and his decapitation.\nAccording to Leland Chee, it is possible that the Falleen pictured in The New Essential Guide to Alien Species is Mithric.",
