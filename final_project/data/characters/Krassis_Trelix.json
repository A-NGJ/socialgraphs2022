 "content": "Krassis Trelix was a pilot and slaver who worked for the Karazak Slavers Cooperative.\nInitially a supply officer for the military, he got offended because he was not being promoted as often as he thought he deserved. He decided to desert and move to the Outer Rim Territories with some valuable military equipment. Once there, he joined the Karazak Slavers Cooperative and became a Logistics Officer. Among the Karazaks, he was considered a crazy man, but was nevertheless begrudgingly respected because of his skills.\nIn 8 ABY, Trelix flew Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that had had several ID signatures implanted into the ship's computer, such as the Indenture and the Salvation. The Indenture had a history among smuggling and other criminal circles. Trelix and his ship were found by Shada D'ukal in 8 ABY, who recognized Trelix as a member of the Karazak Slavers Cooperative. D'ukal, flying The Fury, destroyed Trelix's ship with him on board, killing him.\nIn Galaxy Guide 11: Criminal Organizations, Krassis Trelix's name is written Krassis Trellix.",
