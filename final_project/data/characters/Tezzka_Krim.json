 "content": "Tezzka Krim, a Pyke female, was the wife of Marg Krim, who served as a leader within the Pyke Syndicate during the Clone Wars. Krim was also the mother of two children, Laalee and Vram. Tezzka and her two children were kidnapped by the Black Sun crime syndicate after her husband Krim refused to merge the Pyke Syndicate with the larger Black Sun. She and her children were rescued by the independent bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos from the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar. However, the Krim family was then targeted for retribution by Black Sun.\nTezzka Krim married Marg Krim, a member of the Pyke Syndicate, and together they had two children named Laalee and Pyke. They lived on the Pyke homeworld of Oba Diah. During the Clone Wars, her husband Krim became the head of the Pyke Syndicate, which specialized in distributing all sorts of illegal spice to the galaxy. When Marg rejected the Black Sun syndicate's offer to merge their two syndicates, the Black Sun's leader Ziton Moj ordered the kidnapping of Tezzka and her children to force Marg to reconsider his decision.\nZiton brought Tezzka and her children to the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar where they were imprisoned in a \"house\" at the top of the tower which dominated the fortress. At some point during their captivity, Tezzka was forcibly separated from her children by Ziton's burly Falleen guards and brought into Ziton's palace. Later, Laalee and Vram were rescued by the bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos, who had been hired by her husband to rescue Tezzka and her children. While the hunters failed to find Tezzka, Vos used his psychometric abilities to read Laalee's locket which contained a miniature hologram of Tezzka.\nThrough the locket, Vos experienced a flashback of Tezzka's struggle and realized that she was still in Ziton's palace. After securing the children, Ventress and Vos hatched a plan to rescue Tezzka. Their rescue mission was timely because Ziton had just learned about the children's escape and had issued orders to execute Tezzka as a warning to Krim. Before Ziton could kill Tezzka, Vos managed to rescue her. Following a brief skirmish, she escaped aboard the bounty hunters' ship Banshee where she was reunited with her children.\nVentress and Vos then brought Tezzka and her children back to Oba Diah. Marg was so elated by the rescue of his family that he paid the bounty hunters twice the original amount he had offered. Krim's elation was however short-lived because Black Sun then dispatched a fleet to Oba Diah to settle scores with the Krims. Ventress and Vos witnessed the arrival of the Black Sun fleet just as they were departing Oba Diah. Vos feared that the Black Sun would execute Tezzka and her children in the presence of her husband.\nTezzka Krim was a dutiful wife to Marg Krim and a loving mother for their two children Laalee and Vram. As a Pyke, she had long slender limbs and large, elongated head with a tapered skull. Her devotion for her children led her to struggle with several Falleen Black Sun guards who forcibly separated them. According to Vos, who saw a glimpse of the struggle through his psychometric powers, Tezzka fought like a nexu defending her cubs. Despite her efforts, she was no match for the big-built Falleen, who took her to Ziton's palace. She was also known to have blue eyes.\nTezzka Krim first debuted as a minor character in Christie Golden's 2015 novel Dark Disciple, which was based on eight unproduced screenplays from the canceled Cartoon Network TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Dark Disciple is part of the Canon The Clone Wars Legacy, an ongoing multimedia project using material from the canceled series.",
