Balrekk served in the 84th Stormtrooper Legion as the commander of Talon Company, where he made a name for himself by using torture and other unsavory methods during interrogation of Rebel prisoners. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Balrekk and his company were sent to serve under General Vorrel in an attack on a Rebel base built on the planet Arda-1.",
