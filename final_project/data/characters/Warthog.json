 "content": "\"Warthog\" was a clone trooper pilot who served in the 104th Battalion under Jedi Master Plo Koon during the Clone Wars. He took part in conflicts such as the First Battle of Felucia and the Battle of Kadavo.\nThe clone later nicknamed \"Warthog\" was born on the planet Kamino as a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. He and his brothers were bred for service in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army. He became a pilot in the Republic Navy.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Warthog served under Jedi General Plo Koon and Clone Commander Wolffe in the 104th Battalion. During the First Battle of Felucia, Warthog flew a V-19 Torrent starfighter along side General Koon to evacuate General Kenobi's and Skywalker's troops as they were being surrounded. As Koon took on the vulture droids, Warthog and his fellow clone pilots protected the gunships. However, Warthog picked up two enemy fighters on his tail. He called for help, and was then saved by Koon.\nFollowing the Confederacy's abduction and enslavement of Kiros' Togruta colonists by the Zygerrian's Slave Empire, Warthog went with General Koon, Admiral Barton Coburn's fleet, and the 104th battalion to rescue them, piloting a Clone Z-95 Headhunter. As the men began to eliminate the turret towers as well as the enemy HH-87 Starhoppers, Warthog's fighter was shot in the wing. As Warthog struggled to shake his foe, General Koon came in to shoot down the fighter. Warthog and the men continued to eliminate their targets until it was safe for Admiral Coburn to maneuver his cruiser underneath the facility and rescue the Togrutas.\nWarthog was later part of the Wolfpack effort to aid the people of Aleen, whose planet was devastated by groundquakes.\nWarthog made his first appearance in \"Holocron Heist,\" the first episode of the second season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voiced all the clone troopers in the series.",
