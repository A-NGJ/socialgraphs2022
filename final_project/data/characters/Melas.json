 "content": "Melas was a Sarkan patron of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the year 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. Melas had mottled gray skin and blue eyes and wore red and tan robes, along with a red turban.\nMelas was originally created for the 1997 Special Edition re-release of the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The character was first identified as Melas in Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition, a 1997 Star Wars Legends sourcebook for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, which became canon when it was used in Star Wars: Card Trader, an app released on iOS and Android platforms by The Topps Company, Inc. in 2015. The puppet was a redressing of the one used for the Pacithhip Ketwol. By covering Ketwol's trunk and tusks with a turban and using the back of Ketwol's head as Melas' face, a new creature was made. The new character was shot and edited into the cantina footage, replacing Arleil Schous, whose off-the-shelf canine mask had long bothered A New Hope writer and director George Lucas.",
