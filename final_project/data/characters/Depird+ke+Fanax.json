 "content": "Lord Depird ke Fanax was a Human male starfighter pilot and blastsword duelist from the planet Adumar. In 13 ABY, ke Fanax was invited to the court dinner hosted by the perator of Cartann to celebrate the arrival of Red Flight, a group of New Republic pilots who came to their world as ambassadors. When Wedge Antilles, leader of Red Flight, asked for a performance from Cartann Ground Champion Cheriss ke Hanadi, ke Fanax's challenge for a blastsword duel was accepted by ke Hanadi. ke Fanax sought revenge for his brother, Jeapird ke Fanax, who died from his injuries after losing a duel with ke Hanadi.\nke Fanax lost the duel and ke Hanadi gave the choice of his survival to Antilles as a sign of honor. Hesitant to kill someone senselessly, Antilles spared his life.\nDepird ke Fanax held the belief that as a pilot, he was ultimately better than any non-pilot duelers.\nDepird ke Fanax is a character created by author Aaron Allston for the 1999 novel X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar, the ninth novel in the X-Wing series.",
