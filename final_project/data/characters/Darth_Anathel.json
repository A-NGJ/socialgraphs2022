 "content": "Darth Anathel was a male Human Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic who was a rival of fellow Sith Lord Xarion. The two began to battle in the Stygian Caldera nebula, but their conflict soon disrupted Imperial trade, prompting a negotiator to convince them to move their battle elsewhere in the Outer Rim Territories.\nHe would later rise to the position of Darth during the intervening years, and would sit on the Dark Council by 3628 BBY, as Head of Sith Doctrine - a newly created seat that oversaw the former Spheres of Mysteries, Sith Philosophy \u0026 Ancient Knowledge. His rival Darth Xarion would also be on the Council as Head of Galactic Influence.\nDuring the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught expansion, an Imperial player character who is a Sith Inquisitor could choose to demand Anathel's seat on the Dark Council back the next time they meet. In response, Anathel refuted that the Sith Inquisitor is neither a member of the Dark Council or of the Empire and thus had no grounds to challenge him. He later sends an email to the player character, declaring his rival too feeble compared to him. Following the Meridian Complex assault, as the Dark Council assembled on Vaiken Spacedock in person, the player character proceeds to kill Anathel and has the option to rejoin the Empire as a Dark Councillor, taking his seat. Alternatively, if the player does not challenge Anathel during the Onslaught prologue, his life will be spared at the end of base game.",
