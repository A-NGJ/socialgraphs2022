 "content": "Jubal was a male Devaronian who was living on the planet Tatooine in the years immediately before the Battle of Yavin. Around the year 0 BBY, Jubal and Oxbel were the only other Devaronians that Kardue'sai'Malloc, a Devaronian who went under the assumed name of Labria, knew to live on Tatooine.\nJubal was first mentioned in \"Empire Blues: The Devaronian's Tale\", a short story written by Daniel Keys Moran that was included in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, which was released by Bantam Spectra in 1995. Jubal was later used as an example name for Devaronians in 2003's Ultimate Alien Anthology and in 2007's \"Saga Edition Web Enhancement: Devaronians\".",
