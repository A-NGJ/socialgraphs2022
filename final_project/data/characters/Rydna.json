 "content": "Rydna was a male Human member of the Believers.\nRydna was present during the Destruction of the Almas Academy in 19 BBY, where he obtained the lightsaber of Jedi Master Devan For'deschel from her body after she was killed. He later became part of a Believer cell on Tolea Biqua, but gradually he felt an increasing deprivation and wanted to die. His reasons were that almost all the Believers were wiped out and the leader of the cell, Alina Impeveri, disliked him. As a result, when he was captured by a group of Tunnel Rats, he did not respond to their torture of him, because it was almost what he wanted.",
