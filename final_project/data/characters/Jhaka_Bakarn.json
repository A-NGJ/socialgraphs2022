 "content": "Jhaka Bakarn, born Jhaka Bakvalen, was a dark-haired and light-skinned Human female. She was the eldest daughter of the affluent Bakvalen family on their homeworld of Corellia generations before the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. However, Jhaka shunned her noble life and instead joined the Republic Navy as a starfighter pilot, causing her furious father to disown her.\nJhaka changed her surname to the more common \"Bakarn\" and went on to become a renowned fighter ace in charge of her own squadron. However, she was ultimately killed leading her squadron to victory over a dangerous warlord in the Outer Rim Territories, prompting her grieving father to change the family name to Bakarn in her honor. Bakarn was memorialized by a hologram in Bakvalen Hall, the family's house on Corellia.\nJhaka Bakarn first appears as a hologram in the Jedi Consular mission \"Old Blood\" in the 2011 BioWare massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Her story is given in the Codex entry for the Bakvalen family.",
