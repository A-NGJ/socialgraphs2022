 "content": "Therod-Ton was a male Voss living on Voss during the Cold War. He was the brother of Bas-Ton and often visited his tea house in the Judicial Quarter of the Voss-Ka city.\nAt some point prior to 3640 BBY Bas-Ton was killed and replaced with an impostor by the Imperial Intelligence of the Sith Empire. Neither his children Phi-Ton and Yana-Ton, nor even his brother Therod-Tonever suspected anything. Around 3640 BBY another Imperial Agent, Cipher Nine, made several visits to the teahouse and pretended to become friends with the family. In reality, Cipher required contact and assistance from the Bas-Ton's impostor in their joint mission to track the Shining Man. Bas-Ton's impostor was later killed by Cipher's old enemies and Therod-Ton grieved at the loss, never knowing his brother's true fate.",
