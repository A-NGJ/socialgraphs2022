 "content": "Gorran was a male Gank bounty hunter during the reign of the Galactic Empire.\nA Gank male, Gorran was a bounty hunter active during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Ganks, Gorran's body had been augmented over time by cybernetics. During his career, Gorran became indebted to Giarda of the Jiramma kajidic. While on Nar Shaddaa, Gorran partnered with the Human smuggler Nell on a job to recover a Sakiyan informant and pay off his debts to Giarda, by collecting a bounty placed by the Gorensla clan. When both Gorran and Nell were stopped in the streets by Giarda and her guards, the Hutt manipulated the pair into working for her, allowing Gorran and Nell to proposed turning over Razall over to her in exchange for a clean slate for their debt. When the pair successfully captured Razall, Giarda followed through on her promise of forgiving their debts, privately gloating on her accomplishment of twisting them back into her service.",
