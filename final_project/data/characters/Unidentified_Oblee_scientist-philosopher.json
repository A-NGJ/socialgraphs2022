 "content": "This individual was an Oblee who resided on the planet Oblis in the Cularin system thousands of years before the Clone Wars and was one of the world's scientist-philosophers, the Oblees' leading caste. After a shadow creature traveled to Oblis and melded itself into the planet's atmosphere, the scientist-philosophers determined to use the Darkstaff, an ancient Sith artifact brought to the world by a wandering trader, to power a machine that would allow them to send the shadow creature away from Oblis. This individual was tasked with operating the machine and inserted the Darkstaff into a tray used to power the mechanism. However, the machine did not drive the shadow creature away and instead triggered a large cataclysm that resulted in the destruction of Oblis.\nLater during the Clone Wars, the Heroes of Cularin had a vision of the last moments of Oblis as the scientist-philosopher inserted the Darkstaff into the machine designed to drive the shadow creature away from Oblis.",
