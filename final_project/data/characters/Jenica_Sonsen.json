 "content": "Jenica Sonsen was the administrator of Centerpoint Station during the First Corellian Insurrection and throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War. She was a Human woman with expressive eyebrows, curly black hair, and a long thin face.\nSonsen had an important role in the Centerpoint Crisis guiding around Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Belindi Kalenda, and Gaeriel Captison. She even was attracted to Lando and tried to move on her feelings, which Lando refused due to making a previous promise to another person.\nShe continued in that job as late as 25 ABY, when she was heading the team that was attempting to map the station's interior.",
