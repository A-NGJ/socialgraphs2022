Captain Grov Bricker and First Mate Kelan Faal were taken to Star Home where they were sentenced to be executed, while the rest of the crew including Sowan was sent to a Hapan prison moon. The captain and the crew were eventually released when Faal turned out to be Prince Isolder, who was being sought out by the Queen Mother.",
