 "content": "Rhasiv was a human male doctor imprisoned at the Narkina 5 Imperial Prison Complex during the Imperial Era. In 5 BBY, he was summoned to floor five of the facility to examine Ulaf after he had collapsed from a stroke. He determined that the elderly inmate was unable to be saved and so euthanised him so that he could die peacefully.\nRhasiv wore white inmate scrubs with blue piping instead of the regular orange to denote his role as a med-tech within the prison.",
