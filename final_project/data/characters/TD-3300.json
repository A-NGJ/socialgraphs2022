 "content": "TD-3300 was a human male who served as a stormtrooper in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Not long after the destruction of Alderaan, TD-3300 was stationed aboard the Halcyon starcruiser under the command of General Kardan. During this time, TD-3300 and another stormtrooper were sent to find the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who Kardan had been informed had arrived to steal the Crown Jewels of Alderaan he believed he had just purchased from Maz Kanata. During the chase, the two troopers followed Ohnaka into the auxiliary reactor, and TD-3300 attempted to apprehend the pirate, though he and Ohnaka ending up jumping over an edge and into generators. After seeing what TD-3300 had done, his fellow trooper claimed that TD was never known for being smart, though he believed he had taken out the pirate and reported back to the crew of the ship that he had either died or escaped. Ohnaka, however, had survived.",
