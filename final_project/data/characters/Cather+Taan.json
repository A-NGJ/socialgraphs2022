 "content": "Cather Taan was the male Human owner of Cather Taan's Gun Shop in Storrd Township on Seregar. He was stocky and heavy-set.\nGiven enough time, he could often acquire just about any type of weapon imaginable. He was not known to trade or bargain. His prices to buy or repair items were high, but he considered his inventory and skills worth the cost.",
