 "content": "Nui Gneppe was a male Filordus archivist who worked for the Trade Federation for over a decade until he grew bored with them and went to work for Naescorcom on Ipsus. Within Line Two, Naescorcom's underground thermal detonator production line, Gneppe documented all activities, especially those that involved an explosion.\nGneppe was thin-faced and walked with one shoulder several centimeters lower than the other. He enjoyed telling stories of the feud between the Trade Federation and the Metatheran Cartel, doing a humorous impersonation of a scared Neimoidian asking for droidekas. He was also a galactic history buff.",
