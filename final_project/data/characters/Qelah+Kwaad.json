 "content": "Qelah Kwaad was a Master Shaper of the shaper caste. The Domain sister of Mezhan Kwaad, Kwaad was constantly forced to make up for Mezhan's heresy. However, she was appointed the replacements of Nen Yim and Yal Phaath, both in filling the Eighth cortex and the worldshaping of Coruscant into Yuuzhan'tar. Kwaad also produced the mabugat kan and the Slayers. During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Kwaad was captured by Han Solo at the Well of the World Brain, and was forced to help the Galactic Alliance Forces in pacifying the World Brain. Kwaad was one of the Yuuzhan Vong who went on Zonama Sekot to the Unknown Regions.\nQelah Kwaad had a fearsome appearance.\nQelah Kwaad first appeared in Greg Keyes' 2003 novel The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy.",
