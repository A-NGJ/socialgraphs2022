 "content": "Mahl was a Human male who served as a member of the stormtrooper squad led by Sergeant Nova Stihl during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, he was on duty when Han Solo and Luke Skywalker liberated Princess Leia Organa from Detention Block AA-23 on Level 5 of the first Death Star. Sergeant Stihl ordered Mahl to take the lead in the squad's attempt to capture the Rebels before they could escape. He presumably perished during the Battle of Yavin.\nThis individual was first named in Death Star, although there is no indication which trooper he was, as depicted in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.",
