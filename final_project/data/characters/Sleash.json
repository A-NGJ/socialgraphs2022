 "content": "Sleash was a male Nikto thug who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Sleash was known as a drug addict and resided in Mos Eisley. He was friend with the thug Untas and was acquainted with Oldksam and Taibela. Sleash also used to do business with Vaigon Shinn, the leader of the Shinn muggers.\nIn 1 ABY, Untas was indebted to the crime boss Faeto. When Faeto placed a death mark on him, Oldksam, Sleash and Untas went into hiding. Sleash hided in Vaigon Shinn's Hideout. Nevertheless, Taibela stayed in Mos Eisley where she was questioned by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter persuaded her to reveal where Oldksam was hiding and, after finding him, persuaded Oldksam to reveal Sleash's location. The bounty hunter finally arrived at Vaigon Shinn's Hideout and questioned Sleash. The bounty hunter gave Sleash his favorite spice and convinced him to talk. Sleash was upset that Untas went into hiding without him and gave his former partner's location, the White Thranta Shipping offices. The bounty hunter later found Untas, and finally killed him.\nSleash was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sleash was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
