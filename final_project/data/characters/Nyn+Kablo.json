 "content": "Nyn Kablo was a Twi'lek militant who lived on the planet Ryloth during the Galactic Civil War. Her group was formed to protect the interests of the common Twi'leks on Ryloth and came into conflict with a group of thugs led by Angu Drombb that were terrorizing the nearby mine of New Meen. Her group was headquartered in the town of Nabat.\nNyn Kablo was designed by Dave Allen and Daniel Lovat Clark for The Long Arm of the Hutt, a supplement Star Wars: Edge of the Empire that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012.",
