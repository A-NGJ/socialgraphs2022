 "content": "Rondo was a male Human who lived on the planet Endregaad during the reign of the New Republic. In 19 ABY, Endregaad experienced an outbreak of a deadly viral disease, and Rondo accompanied a caraven that departed from the city Tel Bollin to deliver supplies to families stranded in the Temple Valley region. On the first night of their journey, Rondo stayed up to guard the caravan's vehicles, and he was attacked and killed by several Oasis children. The creatures dragged Rondo's corpse away to be fed to their mother, and when the other caravan guards realized that Rondo was missing, a number of them came to suspect that he had stolen some of the caravan's valuables and fled.",
