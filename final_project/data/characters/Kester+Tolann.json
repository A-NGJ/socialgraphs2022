 "content": "Kester Tolann was a male Human who served the Imperial Remnant. He was the grandson of Imperial Commander Wister Tolann, who had been held back by Grand Admiral Thrawn during his military career. As such, Kester Tolann inherited a strong hate for Thrawn's species, the Chiss, as well as any other non-Human species that he felt competed with Humans.\nIn 43.5 ABY, Imperial Moff Drikl Lecersen conspired with the Senator of Kuat, Haydnat Treen, to unite the Imperial Remnant with the Galactic Alliance and eventually take the place of Chief of State Natasi Daala as ruler of the galaxy. One of their first steps to attain this goal was Lecersen's Operation Duusha, of which Tolann was a part. At the appointed time, Tolann burst into a dining room in the Pangalactus restaurant—where Imperial Remnant Head of State Jagged Fel was dining with the Solo family—in an attempt to assassinate Fel, although he was quickly killed. Unbeknownst to Tolann, Lecersen had planned for him to die during the Operation.",
