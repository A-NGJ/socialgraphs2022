 "content": "Hamaz was an Imperial officer during the Galactic Civil War. He also worked as a gunrunner for the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nHe was eventually captured by Xufal D'uat, a bounty hunter. Hamaz bargained for his release, when the bounty hunter surprisingly realized that an Imperial had been captured. D'uat, as part of the bargain, insisted on a recorded confession of Hamaz's crimes. This was done as insurance in case the Imperial double-crossed the bounty hunter. Hamaz confessed, and he was let go.\nLater, Hamaz hired another bounty hunter to successfully kill D'uat. He was unable to recover the recorded confession, however.\nEven later, Hamaz became an Admiral in charge of fleet operations around Kuat.",
