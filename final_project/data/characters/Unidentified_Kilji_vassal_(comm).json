 "content": "A male Kilji vassal of the Kilji Illumine government operated the comm station of the Kilji war cruiser Whetstone. Around 18 BBY, in the Unknown Regions' Sunrise system, the vassal was ordered by the Grysk Jixtus, an ally of Generalirius Nakirre, the comm vassal's master, to broadcast a signal looking for survivors of a dead Chiss fleet. The Kilji then shared that the signal was already coming in and later mourned the generalirius's death at the hands of Jixtus, forcing Pathfinder navigator Qilori to use another comm to speak with Nakirre's former ally.\nA Kilji male served the government of his species, the Kilji Illumine, as a vassal, a follower of the Illumine's beliefs. He operated the comm station of the Kilji war cruiser Whetstone under the command of the leader of the Illumine, Generalirius Nakirre. Around 18 BBY, following the Whetstone's arrival at the Unknown Regions' Sunrise system, Nakirre's Grysk ally Jixtus saw a deactivated fleet of warships of the Chiss species and commanded the comm vassal to signal for survivors; however, the Kilji announced a signal was already coming in, playing it. Nakirre was killed shortly after by Jixtus. As a result, the Kilji vassal informed the Whetstone's Pathfinder navigator, Qilori, of the consequences of having no master: that the vassals aboard the Whetstone were not able to move or think, for the beliefs they followed prevented them from doing so.\nAs the comm vassal mourned the death of his master, a battle between Jixtus's fleet and the Chiss fleet played out, with the Kilji being oblivious to it. After Jixtus tried to contact Qilori through the Whetstone's comm, the navigator was forced to use Nakirre's vacant chair instead of the comm station, as its operator was bowed over his panel.\nThe vassal appeared in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final volume in the Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy written by Timothy Zahn.",
