 "content": "Lena  was a female Twi'lek dancer who lived during the time of the Jedi Civil War. For a time she lived on Taris, where she met and began dating Griff Vao. They journeyed offworld, where they parted ways after she learned of his sleazy nature.\nGriff's younger sister, Mission, inaccurately blamed Lena for Griff leaving her, as well as for many other undesirable parts of his personality. When they later encountered each other once more, Lena tried to explain her position to Mission, pointing her to Griff's trail.\n\"Lena\"  is the diminutive of the name Helen/Helena/Yelena in various European languages . It is also the diminutive of the name Magdalena, as well as a river in Siberia.\nLena and Griff  appear only if the player visits a space port with Mission in the group, where they are informed about him. There was an option to kill Lena with Force kill or choke, but it was cut from the final version of the game.\nShe has also voiced by Grey DeLisle.",
