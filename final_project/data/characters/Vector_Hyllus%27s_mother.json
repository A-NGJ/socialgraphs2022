 "content": "The mother of Vector Hyllus was a female Human who was native to the planet Jurio. After the reconstituted Sith Empire conquered her world, she met an Imperial captain named Adronik Hyllus, and the two were married after Jurio was granted Imperial governance. In 3666 BBY, Hyllus's wife gave birth to a son they named Vector, who grew up during the Imperial reconstruction of Jurio and joined the Imperial Diplomatic Corps at an early age.\nVector Hyllus's mother was first mentioned in the Codex entry for Vector Hyllus, a companion character for the Imperial Agent class in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
