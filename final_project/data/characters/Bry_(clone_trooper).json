 "content": "\"Bry\" was the nickname of a clone commando who was a member of Galaar Squad, trained by a Corellian sergeant of the Cuy'val Dar to fight for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nAfter Order 66 was enacted and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine established the Galactic Empire, Bry, along with squadmate IC-4447, nicknamed \"Ennen\", were combined with Omega Squad's RC-1309, nicknamed \"Niner\", and Darman Skirata to form Squad 40 of the 501st Legion.\nOn their first mission as a squad, they were sent to the planet Celen to capture Jilam Kester, an Antarian Ranger who was helping Jedi escape capture from the Empire. Upon storming the Kester's residence, the commandos came face to face with Jedi Master Iri Camas, who had previously commanded the Special Operations Brigade. After initially engaging Camas, Bry circled around to outflank the Jedi Master by gaining entry via a front window. However, Bry's attack on Camas was unsuccessful, as the Jedi appeared to be wearing armour which deflected his gauntlet vibroblade. Camas stabbed Bry in the chest with his lightsaber and Force threw him through an exterior wall. Despite Ennen's attempts to revive him, his injuries proved fatal.\nFollowing his death, his body was returned to Coruscant where Ennen demanded he be cremated per the tradition of a Corellian in exile, a heritage the two commandos clung to from their training sergeant. Squad 40's new commanding officer following the disappearance of Sa Cuis, Roly Melusar, gave Bry the proper cremation, putting the man to rest.",
