 "content": "Spots was an Advanced Recon Commando and one of a group of clone troopers left behind on Pengalan IV after their LAAT/i was shot down during a full scale Republic retreat.\nAbandoned with his fellow troopers and a Republic accountant named Joram Kithe, they were on their own to figure out how to get off the desert planet. When Kithe awoke and revealed that he had been commissioned as a Republic Intelligence lieutenant, he was placed in command.\nKithe was disturbed by the troopers' reliance on proper procedure, and tried to foster individuality in them. To that end, he gave the troopers nicknames. Spots gained his nickname because he wore a red-spotted rag around his forehead.\nAfter making their way to Tur Lorkin, the nearest village, and infiltrating a starship bay, Tooth and Kithe realized that the village was in fact the site of the diamond boron missile manufacturing facility, not the factory which had been the site of the earlier trap.\nDetermined to destroy it, Tooth faced Kithe and was willing to defy the man's orders to complete his mission. Impressed, Kithe relented. The troopers sabotaged the factory with Kithe's aid while Tooth stole a Corellian ship to draw the CIS fighters away from the starship bay, allowing Joram and the remaining troopers to escape. Spots protected the crate of missiles which the troops stole in the assault and used to bring down the facility.\nHe survived the mission, and would continue to serve with the other survivors.",
