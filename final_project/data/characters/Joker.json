 "content": "\"Joker\" was the nickname of a clone trooper sergeant who served in the Jedi Temple Hangar during the Clone Wars. He was often known to tell jokes to pass the time during his work shift. His companion, Spanner, often did not understand his companion's jokes. Joker and Spanner both served on the Iceberg Three Republic outpost during a mission to Iceberg Three.\nSergeant Joker first appeared as an Non-Player Character  in Sony Online Entertainment's online game Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures. He and Corporal Spanner can be found in the temple hangar next to the door to the main hall. Clicking on Joker prompts him to tell a joke to Spanner. Unlike most other NPCs in the game, his name isn't displayed above his head, but when he tells a joke to Spanner, the conversation along with the NPCs' names are shown in the players' chat window.\nThe above joke, one of many told by Joker while in the Jedi Temple Hangar, was originally told by Jacen Solo in Star Wars canon.",
