 "content": "Andra was a male Human captain in the Freeworlds Common Navy and commanded a cruiser during the Galactic Civil War. A dignified and distinguished looking man in his fifties, Andra was a career military man who graduated from the Neona Military Academy. He was said to have little patience for fools or snobs. The Andra family had a very ancient lineage, and once belonged to a noble house that was long disbanded when the Freeworlds ceded from the Expanse. When he was not patrolling the Shapani Bypass, Captain Andra could be found attending a number of parties on the freeworlds and occasionally on Procopia.",
