 "content": "Ixgil was a Duros male who lived in the South Apartments on the Outer Rim world Taris during the Jedi Civil War. In 3956 BBY, the apartments were raided by members of Darth Malak's Sith Empire. When Ixgil complained about the activities of the Sith, the Human leader of the raiding group shot him, killing the Duros instantly. Republic soldier Carth Onasi and amnesiac Sith Lord Revan both witnessed the event and defeated the Sith. Following the skirmish, Ixgil's friend hid his corpse to prevent the authorities from learning about the incident.\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, Ixgil resided in the South Apartments of the Upper City on the Outer Rim world Taris with his friend, a fellow Duros. During the war, the Sith Empire, under the command of Darth Malak, invaded and occupied the planet as part of its war effort against the Galactic Republic. In 3956 BBY, upon arriving in the Taris system, the Republic cruiser Endar Spire was ambushed in a battle over the planet. Although the cruiser was destroyed, several troops were able to survive by fleeing to the surface of the ecumenopolis in escape pods. Among the survivors were soldier Carth Onasi and the amnesiac Sith Lord Revan, who possessed implanted memories of a Republic soldier. After they crash-landed, the pair took refuge in the Upper City's South Apartments, where Onasi hoped they would not be found by the Sith.\nTo prevent the escape of Jedi Padawan Bastila Shan, who had also fled the Endar Spire, the Sith imposed a planet-wide quarantine and began a search for her. During the occupation, Sith soldiers regularly raided and searched the apartments, to the annoyance of the residents. Several days after the occurrence of the battle overhead, the apartments were the subject of another raid conducted by a Human soldier and two Sentinel droids. When Ixgil complained, the Human became enraged and shot him in the chest three times, killing Ixgil.\nRevan and Onasi witnessed the event and managed to defeat the Sith raiding party, saving Ixgil's friend. After the fight, Ixgil's friend thanked them and regretted that Ixgil had spoken out against his killers. He later hid the remains of both Ixgil and the Sith to prevent any investigators from learning about the incident, which would have brought about dire consequences for all involved.\nIxgil was a Duros male and as such had blue-green skin, red eyes, and a hunched posture. He was willing to voice his complaints about the Sith and their disruptive activities despite the fact that it could have seen him arrested, injured, or in his case, killed. He lived in the Upper City despite the Humanocentric views of much of the population that prevented most non-Humans from residing there. Ixgil could understand Galactic Basic in addition to Durese, but spoke the latter.\nIxgil wore a mauve and white tunic with matching pants and a black belt.\nIxgil appears as a non-playable character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. His dialogue is spoken during a cutscene from the viewpoint of the player character, Revan. The cutscene, and hence Ixgil's death, cannot be avoided and occurs regardless of the player character's gender or alignment.\nIn the cutscene on the PC version of the game, the Sith soldier has two lines of dialogue that are pronounced differently than their accompanying subtitles. In the first case, the subtitles say, \"Okay you alien scum,\" but the soldier's voice actor clearly says, \"Right you alien scum.\" In the second case, the subtitles say, \"Hey, what's this?,\" instead of the spoken \"What's this?\" The dialogue and the subtitles match in the original Xbox version, as a different voice recording was used. This article assumes the spoken dialogue of the PC version is correct.",
