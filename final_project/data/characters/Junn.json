 "content": "Junn was a well connected human criminal who used the self-styled title of lord and knew Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan during her childhood. In the year 0 ABY, Junn was living on the planet Naboo and discovered that Organa had arrived there as part of her mission to rescue the survivors of her homeworld's destruction. Knowing that Organa was part of the Rebel Alliance and fearing that his kind would not fare well if the Galactic Empire was overthrown, Junn devised a scheme to have her killed.\nAfter locating the princess, he invited Organa and her companions back to his palace and informed them that the Melodic Order—the Alderaanians they sought—could be found in Club Deeja in the city of Keren. Junn had previously had business with the club's owner, Mul Sanaka, and ordered him to kill the princess and her friends. Organa managed to defeat the club owner and his thugs and returned to Junn, demanding a starship as recompense for his betrayal.\nThe self-styled \"Lord\" Junn was a well-connected criminal who was a friend of the planet Alderaan's House of Organa, including Viceroy Bail Organa and his adoptive daughter, Leia Organa. He knew Leia during her childhood and watched her grow up to join her father as a senator of her homeworld in the Imperial Senate. By the year 0 ABY, Junn lived on the planet Naboo, where he sometimes did business with Mul Sanaka, the owner of Club Deeja in the city of Keren, who was in debt to the lord.\nFollowing the destruction of Alderaan by the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon, Leia Organa undertook a mission to save all remaining Alderaanians in the galaxy, as she feared that the Empire would hunt them down in the aftermath. Her first port of call was Naboo, where she hoped to locate and rescue the Melodic Order, a cloister of Alderaanian musicians working in Club Deeja. Upon arriving in the planet's capital city of Theed, she transmitted a signal identifying herself as an Imperial. Junn recognized the signal as a plant and realized it was Organa arriving.\nAware that Organa was a member of the Rebel Alliance and fearing his kind would not fare well if the Rebellion overthrew the Empire, Junn betrayed her to the Empire and made his way to Theed's spaceport and found the princess, pretending to have encountered her by chance. After expressing joy that Organa had survived the destruction of Alderaan, Junn brought her party, including pilot Evaan Verlaine and the astromech droid R2-D2, back to his palace. After Organa explained that she was searching for the Melodic Order, Junn saw an opportunity to be rid of her and to potentially profit from locating the Order for the Empire.\nPromising to make arrangements for the princess, Junn contacted Sanaka and warned him that Organa would be visiting Club Deeja, giving him orders to kill the princess and her companions. He then wished Organa luck and sent her off to Keren. Despite Junn's orders to Sanaka, Organa and her companions were able to defeat the club owner and his thugs and rescue the Order, after which Organa returned to Junn's palace. The lord was drinking and sitting alone in the dark when he sensed her presence, switching on the light and revealing the princess aiming her blaster pistol at him. Expecting to die, Junn apologized for betraying his old friend and explained his motives; however, Organa decided to let the traitor live and instead demanded a starship in exchange for sparing him. Junn provided her with his shuttle, the Lord Junn, which the princess then used to transport the Order offworld and find more Alderaanians.\nJunn was a human male with black hair, blue eyes, and tan skin. He wore ornate clothing and valued living in comfort, to the point that he would betray his beloved friend Leia Organa to preserve it. He did not care for the Imperial regime, but he feared what would happen to his kind if the Rebel Alliance prevailed in its war against the Empire.\nNot wanting his palatial home to become a target for the Alliance, Junn chose not to kill Organa there and instead sent her to Club Deeja, where he also hoped to profit by turning the Melodic Order over to the Empire. When Organa returned after his betrayal, Junn assumed she would kill him but seemed unfazed by his apparent fate.\nJunn wore a blue cloak over a red robe with a black belt when he first met with Leia Organa on Naboo. He later changed into a red shirt with a brown jacket. He owned the shuttle Lord Junn, which he ultimately surrendered to Organa.\nJunn first appeared in the comic book Princess Leia 2, which was released on March 18, 2015. The Star Wars: Princess Leia comic series was written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Terry Dodson.",
