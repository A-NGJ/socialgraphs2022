 "content": "Torpin was an Imperial Moff during the Galactic Civil War.\nA short, stout man, Torpin became a Moff despite never having served in the Imperial Military, and commanded no respect from his subordinates. He was one of the two Moffs with territories bordering the Maelstrom. Along with his compatriot, Moff Vanko, Torpin submitted falsified budgets and financial reports to the Galactic Empire to try and hide the fact that he was losing a great deal of money and resources to the Riders of the Maelstrom, a pirate group operating in the Maelstrom. He and Vanko met in secret on board the luxury liner Kuari Princess, to discuss what their next moves would be. Both believed that the pirates were in league with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and were planning a major offensive against them. The Kuari Princess was hijacked by the Riders.",
