 "content": "Pressik was a male Human who served as an officer in the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War.\nIn 3640 BBY, he commanded one of the Orbital Defense Command Center's Emergency Response Teams on the planet Ziost. Theron Shan, a spy working for the Republic, planning to steal the Black Cipher from the Empire and complete an assault on Darth Karrid's Ascendant Spear, uncovered Pressik's reputation for being drunk and violent. He visited Pressik in a bar on Ziost, starting a confrontation to try and get a scan of Pressik's retinas in order to infiltrate the ODCC.\nAt first, Pressik did not respond to Theron's attempts to begin confrontation, simply turning away, but eventually, the two engaged in a brawl, Theron managing to get a scan of Pressik's retinas.\nLater on, when Theron infiltrated the ODCC, Pressik, along with the rest of his Emergency Response Team were some of the first on the site of the ODCC Infiltration, the team engaged in a shootout with Theron until Jedi Master Gnost-Dural appeared to help Theron, killing Pressik and his Response Team.\nPressik was considered to be arrogant and always saw himself as superior than everyone else, Pressik was a very heavy drinker, and when he got drunk, he got violent. Though he was always intelligent enough to pick fights with civilians rather than harm his military career.",
