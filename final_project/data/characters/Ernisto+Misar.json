 "content": "Ernisto Misar was a male Drall who worked as an environmental specialist and doctor during the Galactic War.\nIn 3640 BBY, Doctor Misar discovered that the fighting in the factory had ruptured its main pipelines, causing toxic chemicals to spill into one of the city's aquifers. He requested a Republic citizen to acquire spare parts from an area guarded by enemy droids, after which his clan was able to repair the pipelines thanks to the Republic efforts.",
