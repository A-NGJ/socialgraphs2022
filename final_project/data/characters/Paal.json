 "content": "Paal was a male Human criminal in the employ of Sylas Wilkes who was one of fifteen men tasked with guarding a shipment of blasters and a Sith artifact for their boss on Tatooine. However, the artifact drove the group mad, and they fled into the Dune Sea with the blasters and the artifacts. As the artifact's influence over them grew, they were picked off one by one by either the Sand People or themselves. As only three men were left alive, Pall shot Bekis and decided to bring the artifact to a Sand People campsite as a peace offering, but was killed as soon as he got there.\nPaal's corpse appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Sith Inquisitor class mission on Tatooine.",
