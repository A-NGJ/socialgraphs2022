 "content": "Noldan was a Force-sensitive male Trandoshan who lived in Aurilia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was a master of melee combat and was known to train outsiders who were working for the good of Aurilia. He was secretly in love with Marite, although, unknown to him, she knew this and reciprocated his feelings, but refused to act upon them until Aurilia was safe . It is unknown if they pursued a relationship after Mellichae was defeated.\nNoldan featured in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, but was removed as part the New Game Enhancements of 2005, along with Aurilia.",
