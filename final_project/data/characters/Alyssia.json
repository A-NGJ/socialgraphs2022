 "content": "Alyssia was a princess of the Hapan Royal House, a niece of Ta'a Chume, to whom she bore a close physical resemblance. She was also the younger sister of Chelik.\nRegard as particularly cunning and ruthless even by the standards of the Hapan royal family, Alyssia had ambitions to become Queen Mother of Hapes, in pursuit of which she plotted against the families of both her aunt Ta'a Chume and her sister Chelik.\nIn 27 ABY, as the reigning Queen Mother Teneniel Djo was rapidly losing influence, Alyssia put her plans into action. She won the loyalty of Ta'a Chume's lover and advisor, the male courtesan Trisdin Gheer, which gave her insights into the plans of the ruling branch of the royal family, and to weaken the rival claim of her elder sister Chelik, she appears to have convinced Chelik's daughter to attempt the assassination of Prince Isolder.\nIn the end, her plotting was for naught, as her cousin Tenel Ka took the throne.",
