 "content": "Wertsnik was a male Trandoshan soldier and a member of Mynnic's band of adventurers around 32 BBY. He was a veteran of many battles.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin, Wertsnik was present on the planet Dathomir when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility. Wertsnik fell victim to the Blackwing virus, and turned into an undead manifestation. His undead body was controlled by the virus and kept walking around in the Quarantine Zone until it was destroyed by a spacer.\nWertsnik was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Wertsnik was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", released on October 12, 2009. Hee was one of the Undead boss enemies in the Quarantine Zone that players have to kill to complete a collection.",
