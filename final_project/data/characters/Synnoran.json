 "content": "Synnoran was a female Human Lieutenant of the Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nDuring the Cold War, Synnoran was stationed on Taris by her father Lord Synnoran to help recapture an outpost, however it turned out to be a rakghoul nest and the entire platoon was killed. Additionally someone had activated the outpost's self-destruct but it was stopped when power was lost.\nBack at the 75th Legion forward camp within the Tularan Marsh, she met an Imperial spacer whom she asked for their help to reclaim the outpost.\nShe is the descendant of the \"legendary\" Darth Synn.",
