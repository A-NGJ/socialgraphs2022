 "content": "Tippet was an Ewok member of Bright Tree Village. He was betrothed to Princess Kamida, and when C-3PO reported impropriety on the part of a Lahsbee ambassador, he declared war on the Lahsbee. The incident had actually been manufactured by First Officer Hirog of the Hiromi Empire, who was trying to unbalance the Alliance to make it easier to conquer.\nAs the Ewok warriors mobilized, donning stormtrooper armor, Lando Calrissian managed to convince the two beings to settle the matter in an honor duel, rather than dragging the entire Alliance of Free Planets into a civil war.\nThe fight appeared to be one-sided until the Lahsbee morphed into a ferocious Huhk. When the other Lahsbee joined the fight to subdue their fellow representative, the situation was resolved as the two species saw they could work together.\nLater, Tippet alerted Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to Nagai troops preparing for a ground attack while Alliance ships fought a Nagai fleet above the forest moon.\nThe character's name may have been influenced by that of visual-effects artist Phil Tippett, who worked on The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi; that of the Ewok Nippet, who appeared in Return of the Jedi; or both.\nIn 2012, Hasbro made an action figure of Tippet. It was included in a Toys \"R\" Usâ€“exclusive Ewok pack.",
