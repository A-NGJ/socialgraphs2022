 "content": "Shayne Gerrare was a male Cerean who resided on the planet Gadrin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nIn 31 BBY, he worked as the head of R\u0026D for Spirited Spirits, and created the famed Double-Dip Outer Rim Rumdrop. He lived alone and had included important security devices in his house.\nShayne decided to join the Cularin resistance, and he might have had contacts in the Hiironi irstat who could provide the resistance with the location of a valid headquarters. Somehow, the Metatheran Cartel got wind of the resistance and Gerrare's plans to join them, as they tried to take him before he could. He was saved by a resistance force that caught them in the act. The battle left scorch marks on his house's front door.",
