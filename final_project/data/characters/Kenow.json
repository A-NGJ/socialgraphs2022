 "content": "Kenow was a Human male who served as part of the Renatasian Confederation during the era of the Galactic Civil War. Kenow grew up on a farm in the Renatasia system, before joining military service in time to serve in the bloody Battle of the Rood. Kenow survived, in doing so forming a lifelong bond with a fellow farmboy named Klyn Shanga, and embarked on a career as a soldier that resulted in him reaching the rank of Colonel. The Galactic Empire invaded and brutally subjugated the Renatasia system during the early Imperial Period, leading Kenow and Shanga to help form a vigilante group called the Renatasian Confederation, which was sworn to hunt down the \"Butcher of Renatasia\"—the individual who supposedly betrayed Renatasia to the Empire, whom they identified as the droid Vuffi Raa.\nAfter a years-long hunt, Kenow, Shanga and what remained of the Confederation finally tracked Raa to the wealthy Oseon system, specifically finding Raa's ship, the Millennium Falcon, on the asteroid Oseon 6845. As the Oseon had extremely strict weapons laws, Kenow sneaked into the Millennium Falcon's hangar armed only with a large titanium pipe. Instead of Raa, Kenow encountered Raa's new master, the gambler and smuggler Lando Calrissian—although the Colonel got the drop on Calrissian, the man produced a hidden stingbeam weapon and fired it into Kenow at close range, killing him instantly.",
