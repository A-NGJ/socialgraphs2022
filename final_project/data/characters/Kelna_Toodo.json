 "content": "Kelna Toodo was a Duros gambler. Early in his career, Toodo had been a pilot's apprentice when he discovered the lure of gambling. Soon, he finished his apprenticeship, bought the Hot Streak, a Z-95 Headhunter, with the money that he had earned gambling, and became a professional gambler. However, he was caught cheating on Beeda the Hutt's floating casino. To keep himself from being punished, he accepted a job as one of Beeda's snitches.\nDespite his image in Ultimate Adversaries, Kelna Toodo was described in the book as having dark green skin and glossy yellow eyes.",
