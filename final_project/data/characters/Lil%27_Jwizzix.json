 "content": "Lil' Jwizzix was the name given to one of the exoboars of Bergola's pack that was kept in the pens of the Palace of the Eternal Dragon on Zakuul during the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin in 3630 BBY. Shortly before the Festival Bergola got sick and beast worker Bev tried to give her medicine, but she would not eat it. After the Eternal Empress Vaylin's speech was interrupted by the arrival of the Alliance Commander and the former Emperor Arcann, Beast master Oleg sent Bergola as well as her pack of Exoboars including Brick, Lil' Jwizzix and Rompy to deal with the captured Zakuulan rebels. After escaping a confrontation with Arcann, Vaylin ordered the Eternal Fleet to bomb the Palace into rubble.\nLil' Jwizzix appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during \"Chapter VI: The Dragon's Maw.\" If the player completes an optional side objectives of adding food from the kitchen to her medicine, Bergola would eat it and show gratitude later, with her entire pack assisting the player throughout the rest of the chapter. Otherwise, Bergola and her pack would be hostile, requiring the player to kill them to progress.",
