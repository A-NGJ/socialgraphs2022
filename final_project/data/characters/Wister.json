 "content": "Wister was a male Human pilot in Rogue Squadron.\nThe Human male pilot known as Wister was a member of the Rebel Alliance's elite Rogue Squadron in the year 4 ABY. He flew with the Rogues When the Alliance struck at the Galactic Empire's unfinished Death Star II battlestation in that year, in the Battle of Endor. Temporarily renamed Red Squadron for the battle, the Rogues scored a large number of kills and remained mostly intact, even as their fellow squadrons were devastated by the Imperial defense.\nThe Alliance won the day when the Death Star was destroyed, and they maintained a presence at Endor for some time. Not long after the battle, Wister was flying as Rogue Two alongside Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles and Rogue Three Kirst. When they came across the wreckage of the Super Star Destroyer Executor on the surface of the moon, Wister was killed by its still-active turbolasters. Kirst mourned his death greatly, and Antilles wrote a letter to his relatives to inform them of his demise.",
