 "content": "Keska' Cay was a male Ualaq Aqualish assassin who lived on the planet Tatooine during the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Keska' Cay worked for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. In 1 ABY, a member of the Valarian Syndicate named Una betrayed Lady Valarian and sold information to Jabba the Hutt. Una informed the Hutt about one of Valarian's gun running operations so Jabba used the lunatic killer Keska' Cay to assassinate one of the pilots running that operation. In retaliation, Lady Valarian later tasked a spacer with killing Una and Keska' Cay.\nKeska' Cay was a cut non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nKeska' Cay was intended to be part of the cancelled Valarian Themepark. This questline was initially planned to be introduced in the game with the \"Publish 23\" to replace the original \"Valarian Quest Series.\" Although the old \"Valarian Quest Series\" was deactivated with the release of Publish 23 on August 31, 2005, the new Themepark was never activated. Several NPCs of the Valarian Theme Park were implemented into the game but Keska' Cay was not known to have appeared on the live servers. Unused game files pertaining to this questline indicated that Keska' Cay was intended to be part of a new quest named \"Fencing.\" An emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format revealed what he would have looked like.",
