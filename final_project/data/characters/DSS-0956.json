 "content": "DSS-0956 was the desert stormtrooper senior officer of Desert Sands during their deployment to Tatooine. He reported to Captain Mod Terrik, and failed to recover the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO at the Lars homestead.\nDSS-0956 was equipped with the standard modified stormtrooper armor issued to sandtroopers. He also carried a long-range comlink, a blaster pistol, a heavy blaster rifle, and a food/water pack.\nDSS-0956 was created in 1989's Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope, and was synonymously featured in the Tatooine Debriefing story within the book.\nIn the 2007 \"Look Sir, Droids\" action figure set made by Sideshow Collectibles, DSS-0956 was identified as the sandtrooper who was addressed by Davin Felth in the source scene from the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. However, the 1996 story When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale identified that character as Mod Terrik, who was further established to be killed attempting to prevent the Millennium Falcon's escape, whereas DSS-0956 was established by Tatooine Debriefing to have lived past those events. In 2008, DSS-0956 was given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, which clarified that he served under Terrik.",
