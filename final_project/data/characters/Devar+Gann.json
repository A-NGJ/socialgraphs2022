 "content": "Devar Gann was a male Human diplomat of the living Galactic Republic during the Galactic War. His sister Kindra Gann suffered from a rare form of Mizra Syndrome since birth, but was healed following a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Healing on Voss. As a payment for the treatment, she chose to stay at the Shrine, serving the Voss Mystic Kina-Re. The mother of the Gann siblings was also ill and Devar promised to notify Kindra should anything happen to her. That occasion came to pass around 3640 BBY, but when their mother was on her deathbed, Devar found he had no way to contact his sister. Using diplomatic channels, he contacted a Republic privateer named Voidhound who was on Voss on his own business and promised payment in reward for delivering the information to Kindra at the Shrine.",
