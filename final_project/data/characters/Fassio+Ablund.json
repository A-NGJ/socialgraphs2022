 "content": "Fassio Ablund was a human male who lived on the moon Jedha during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Seeking protection from a local band of insurgents led by Saw Gerrera, he sold information concerning the group's movements to the Empire. His Imperial associations were ended when he was caught stealing armor from a fallen Imperial tank trooper and declared a criminal, leaving him with no allies on Jedha at all. In 0 BBY, he was present in Jedha City shortly before the city was destroyed by the Empire's Death Star.\nFassio Ablund first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 15, 2016. He was not identified in the film but received a name in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the day after the film.",
