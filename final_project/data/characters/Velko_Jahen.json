 "content": "Velko Jahen was a Soikan female who served as an aide to the Galactic Republic head of the Starlight Beacon space station during the High Republic Era. After arriving on the station, Velko had to deal with her new job and experiencing the Jedi of the Jedi Order for the first time.\nAt some point after the Slaughter on Daivak, Jahen approached Estala Maru while he was conversing with Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis and reported an ongoing Nihil attack in the Rseik sector. Maru thanked her for the information and gave the mission to Trennis.\nVelko Jahen was created for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing initiative, primarily appearing in short stories within the Star Wars Insider \"Starlight\" series written by Cavan Scott and Justina Ireland. She was first mentioned, albeit only by her forename, in the initiative's launch event on January 4, 2021, and subsequently first appeared in the first part of the short story \"Starlight: First Duty,\" written by Scott and published in Star Wars Insider 201 on March 30. Jahen was later pictured in the second part of \"First Duty\" in Star Wars Insider 202 on April 27. On August 31, 2021, Jahen appeared as a voiced character in the audio drama The High Republic: Tempest Runner, though the voice actor was uncredited.\nThough the High Republic initiative is largely focused on the Jedi, the Insider short stories focus on the regular denizens aboard the Starlight Beacon. To that end, Jahen acts to show the reader the point of view of a character on the station who had not previously experienced the Jedi.",
