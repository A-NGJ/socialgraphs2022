 "content": "Cee-Cee-Seventeen-Seventy-One, nicknamed \"Sticks,\" was a Clone Commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Commander Sticks served under Jedi General Sivad and his Padawan during a siege on Hebekrr Minor against Separatist Alliance forces.\nThe Clone Commander first appeared in Queen's Hope, a novel by E. K. Johnston. On May 1, 2021, prior to the release of the novel, E. K. asked on Twitter if anyone had a blank canvas of a clone trooper that could be used by an author to design colors for. She further specified if anyone could provide one each for a CC and a CT.\nOn September 26 of the same year, E. K. provided a conversation she had with \"Tiny Hulk,\" to Jennifer Heddle on how \"Tiny Hulk\" was drawing clones from Queen's Hope. The conversation included the clone's equipment, armor customization inspired by David Bowie, and fears. E. K. provided \"Tiny Hulk's\" drawing of the commander. In the drawing, Commander Sticks was depicted with a jetpack and lightning bolts.",
