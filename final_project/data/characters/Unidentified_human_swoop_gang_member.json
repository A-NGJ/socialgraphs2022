 "content": "A human female was a member of a swoop gang between 3 ABY and 4 ABY. After the gang received an invitation from the resurgent criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn, they traveled to a cantina on the planet Arkanis. Sometime after they arrived at the cantina, the human told a Chagrian member of the gang that Crimson Dawn had said that the carbonite-frozen body of the smuggler Han Solo would be theirs to collect. She then expressed her unsureness of whether they could trust Crimson Dawn. The human then watched as the Sith assassin Ochi made his way into the bar and briefly fought with the Chagrian. After the fight was over, Ochi asked the patrons of the bar if they could tell him the significance of the invitation as he nabbed it from the human gang member.",
