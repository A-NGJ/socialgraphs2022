 "content": "Davonn was a Human male lieutenant who served in the air forces of Naboo.\nIn 31 BBY, just after the Invasion of Naboo, Davonn was the pilot of an N-1 starfighter on Kwilaan spaceport. He was the leader of Guardian flight.\nThe YT-1300 light freighter Majestic Gundark tried to take off without permission, as it was believed that it was holding an illegal cargo. Davonn and another member of Guardian Flight took off and tried to intercept the ship.\nAlthough Davonn could not stop the Gundark from reaching hyperspace, Davonn managed to track its hyperspace vector. Davonn reported this information to his superiors, whom would later learn that the Gundark was going to Stend IV.",
