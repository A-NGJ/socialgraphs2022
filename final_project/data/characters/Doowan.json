 "content": "Doowan was a Nautolan male who was an associate of the arms dealer known as the Dragon during the Galactic Civil War. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Doowan was at a droid-fighting den on Anthan Prime, where he became involved in a skirmish between the Empire and a group of spectators at the fighting den. During the fight, he was isolated and interrogated by Darth Vader and Inspector Thanoth about the location of the Dragon. After some forceful negotiations, Doowan gave the two men the location of the Dragon before being handed into the custody of Morit and Aiolin Astarte to be used in their investigation into arms dealing. Rather than continuing to use him as a source, Morit immediately decapitated the Nautolan, claiming the act to be a show of force on behalf of the Empire.",
