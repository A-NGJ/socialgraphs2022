 "content": "A Troukree was among a group of fellow Troukree refugees, led by their spokesman, Vaantaar, who had been displaced from their homeworld by the alien warlord Nuso Esva. Eight months after the Battle of Yavin, the Troukree and their comrades accompanied Vaantaar to aid the group of rogue stormtroopers known as the Hand of Judgment in the defense of Imperial Governor Bidor Ferrouz of the planet Poln Major, which was similarly being threatened by Esva. During a fight against Esva's troops in Whitestone City, the Troukree died when they used their own body to shield the leader of the Hand of Judgment, Daric LaRone, from the fire of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.\nA Troukree, along with a group of refugees of their species, fled from their homeworld after it was threatened by the advances of Nuso Esva, an alien warlord. At some point by 0 ABY, the Troukree refugees settled on Poln Major, capital planet of the Candoras sector, in the Outer Rim Territories. During the group's stay on Poln Major, the leader of the refugees, Vaantaar, also acted as an agent of Senior Captain Thrawn of the Galactic Empire and Empire of the Hand. On Poln Major, the Troukree refugee joined Vaantaar in helping the Hand of Judgment, a group of five stormtrooper deserters, to protect Imperial Governor Bidor Ferrouz against assassination attempts organized by Esva's elite troops, the Chosen. The Governor's death was intended to be bait to lure Thrawn into a trap prepared by Esva in the Poln system. In the basement of the Whistling Wind tapcafe in Whitestone City, two members of the Hand of Judgment, Joak Quiller and Korlo Brightwater, taught basic stormtrooper battle tactics to their Troukree allies, while Daric LaRone and Saberan Marcross, two other stormtroopers, fought off the first attack against their sanctuary.\nDuring the second attack, the Troukree sacrificed their life to shield LaRone, the stormtroopers' leader, from the fire of an enemy E-Web heavy repeating blaster with their own bodyâ€”one of the Troukree's companions helped them to jump over LaRone's head as the stormtrooper approached the weapon, thus providing cover. The defenders fought off three attacks against their sanctuary, losing only the Troukree that had shielded LaRone during the second wave, before Troukree reinforcements arrived outside the tapcafe. Their sacrifice deeply touched the stormtroopers, as they had not expected an alien to risk their life to protect a Human. The act later contributed to their decision to accept Thrawn's offer to join his Empire of the Hand to train a new strain of stormtroopers, who would accept aliens into their ranks and which was named after the Imperial 501st Legion.\nLike the other Troukree warriors following Vaantaar, the Troukree was experienced with knives in close-quarters combat. They were also skilled in acrobatics, a talent they used to enhance their combat performance and to jump high into the air with the help of a companion when protecting LaRone against an E-Web heavy repeating blaster. During their time with the Hand of Judgment, the Troukree received additional training in the use of blaster weapons from Quiller and Brightwater. The Troukree was willing to sacrifice his life to ensure that LaRone's attempt to destroy the E-Web threat was successful. They had green, scaly skin, with patches of fur of the same color.\nThe Troukree appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2011 novel Choices of One.",
