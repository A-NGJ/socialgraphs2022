 "content": "Lieutenant Sundria Khartoor was a female Near-Human working for the Royal Guard as a violent crimes officer during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Sundria Khartoor was in charge of the hunt for the escaped murderer Hunnos Jarkey. She employed RSF agents who had previously worked under Pooja Naberrie, and had recently carried out a successful rescue mission. She tasked them first to investigate the criminals known as the Peddlers, then Borvo's thug Derm Worrit, and finally Jarkey's father himself. They then found that Jarkey briefly took refuge among different criminal organization, namely the Muskegs, the Skaak Tippers and the Mummers. The spacers eventually discovered that Jarkey had recruited a small army of Naboo pirates and fortified a ranch near Theed. Lieutenant Sundria Khartoor planned the assault in which Hunnos Jarkey and all pirates were finally killed.\nSundria Khartoor appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Sundria Khartoor was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
