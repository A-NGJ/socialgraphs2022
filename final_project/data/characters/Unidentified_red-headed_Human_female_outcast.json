 "content": "A Human female lived in a settlement of outcasts around 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars. The Human took part in a fight on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V that was fought against the clone armies of the Galactic Republic. The battle was originally planned to be set against a detachment of clone troopers and their Jedi commander, Joc Sah. The fight unexpectedly took a different turn however when the clone troopers were ordered to execute Order 66; a directive that labeled all Jedi as traitors to the Republic and that they were to be executed immediately. The settlement leader, a Human named Gaan, made peace with Joc Sah, and together with the other settlers they repelled the clone troopers. The girl took her place on a rooftop with three other outcasts for the fight. She survived the encounter with Sah's troopers, and fought against another detachment of clone troopers that arrived soon after to ensure Sah's elimination. The girl hung out with a Human male outcast.",
