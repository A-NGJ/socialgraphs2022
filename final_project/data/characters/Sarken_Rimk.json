 "content": "Sarken Rimk was a Gungan who ran a dive instruction business out of his home on Whitesand Island on Dorumaa. He was an impatient teacher, and would irritably flip his ears when somebody grated on him. He would also mutter insults under his breath.\nSecretly, Sarken was slightly Force-sensitive. He was capable of influencing customers enough that they were always sure that they learned a great deal from him, worthy of leaving a healthy tip.",
