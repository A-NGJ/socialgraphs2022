 "content": "Jin-Rio Akabi was a Human female diplomat for the Rebel Alliance from Colstev.\nJin-Rio Akabi was a Human female from Colstev. She was a student at the University of Zo-Ro before the massacre there. She joined the Alliance Special Operations as a Political Advisor to stop further such incidents. In 0 ABY she was involved with operations at the captured Whisper Base.\nJin-Rio, Zal Artha, Vendri DeRalm, Cael Hanarist, Tendaar Bel, and Arkhan Brem'tu were assigned to infiltrate Whisper Base on Onderon. Their mission was to isolate the base from any external communication, disable the shuttles and capture the base before Lieutenant Sarev called for reinforcements. Once the group landed on Onderon, they avoided stormtrooper patrols and crossed the dense jungle for a few hours before they finally arrived at Whisper Base. They entered through the garage and quickly sliced the communication line, which caused an enemy patrol to direct their attention towards the garage.\nThe squad of rebels hid in different areas successfully and awaited the patrol's arrival. They eliminated the patrol of soldiers in a fast and efficient manner, without alerting the rest of the base.",
