 "content": "Brandy MacMillian was a female Human from the planet Corellia. A freighter captain, MacMillian was a member of the Corellian Merchants' Guild, and at some point earned a Corellian Bloodstripe. MacMillian retired to Gandle Ott, a world in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories, where she maintained the local Corellian Merchants' Guild Guildhouse and possessed a large amount of navigational data regarding the Kathol sector.\nA native of Corellia, Brandy MacMillian was a Human woman who plied her trade as a freighter captain. At some point during her life, she earned the Corellian Bloodstripe and joined the Corellian Merchants' Guild. After many years as a freighter captain, MacMillian eventually decided to retire; she chose to settle on the planet Gandle Ott, a remote world located in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. On Gandle Ott, MacMillian maintained a small Corellian Merchants' Guild Guildhouse.\nDuring her time as head of the Guildhouse, MacMillian amassed a large amount of navigational information regarding the Kathol sector and was willing to copy it for members of the Corellian Merchants' Guild for a fee of 100 credits. In 8 ABY, the New Republic CR90 corvette FarStar stopped over at Gandle Ott while on a mission to track down the rogue Imperial Moff Kentor Sarne. The crew of the FarStar was in need of navigational charts of the sector, as Moff Sarne had wiped the records on the sector capital of Kal'Shebbol clean during his withdrawal, and the crew only had access to partial maps that did not show details beyond Gandle Ott. During their layover, MacMillian was one of the potential sources from which they considered obtaining the information.\nBy 8 ABY, MacMillian was an aged woman, with salty hair and wrinkles covering her face. She possessed a no-nonsense attitude, and the Corellian Bloodstripe that she had earned proved her tenacity, displaying the fact that she was not a woman to cross. She acted friendly toward fellow Corellians, especially those allied with the New Republic, as she believed that the galactic government was capable of restoring peace to the galaxy.\nBrandy MacMillian was first mentioned in Death Is Remotely Possible, a roleplaying game adventure in The DarkStryder Campaign published by West End Games as a possible source of astrogation charts that the player characters could acquire to continue their adventure. She later received an entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.\nMacMillian's character does not have to be encountered in the adventure; the main aim of the players is to acquire navigational data and the adventure provides several ways for the players to obtain it. MacMillian is only one of several options, and her participation in the scenario is dependent on the player's actions.",
