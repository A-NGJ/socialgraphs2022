 "content": "An Onderonian major was in charge of the investigation of the death of Sullio in Iziz in 3951 BBY.\nIn 3951 BBY, Captain Sullio was killed in the city of Iziz on Onderon. Under the supervision of this major, an investigation implicated a local doctor named Dhagon Ghent.\nAn exiled Jedi named Meetra Surik required Ghent's assistance to set up a meeting with Kavar, a Jedi Master hiding on the planet, so she investigated the murder far more deeply than the major had. She uncovered evidence and eyewitness accounts proving that Ghent could not have been the killer.\nSurik brought this new evidence to Captain Riiken, who believed the information would be of great assistance. However, rather than concurring with his subordinate, the major reacted with skepticism and anger. Only after a great deal of persuasion did he agree to release Ghent due to the new evidence.\nThe major wore a standard blue Onderonian officer's uniform, including a white cape over the right shoulder. He also carried a blaster pistol.\nThis major was created for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, a video game released in late 2004 by Obsidian Entertainment, but was not given a name. He used the same 3-D head model as the character Rukil and Ahlan Matale from the previous game in the series, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, released the previous year.",
