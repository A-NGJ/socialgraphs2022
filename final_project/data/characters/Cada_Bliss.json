 "content": "Cada Bliss was a male Duros criminal active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA rich Duros obsessed with collecting everything about Twi'lek culture, Cada Bliss fell victim to a heist organized by a Twi'lek gang. Led by Taunt and including Vette, Plasmajack and Flash, the gang stripped Bliss of almost everything valuable. Bliss's revenge on the gang was hard: mercenaries were set on their tail and Vette was captured and sold into slavery. Taunt and the others tracked down Bliss in return, hoping for eventual payback. By the time Vette changed hands and ended up with a Sith apprentice of Darth Baras, Bliss has acquired a Twi'lek artifact called the Star of Kala'unn. Driven by her desire to take the artifact back, Vette convinced the Sith to confront Cada Bliss and his Kaleesh bodyguard Virus at the Nar Shaddaa spaceport. Bliss and his partner engaged the Twi'lek and her Sith master in a brutal fight, but their enemies took the upper hand. With the Virus dead, Bliss was forced to give up the Star of Kala'unn and promise Vette that he would reform.",
