 "content": "Gravefeather was the name of a carrion spat pack leader that lived in the Riverlands of Corellia during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, Gravefeather and its pack of enraged carrion spats attacked the farms on the outskirts of Coronet City, such as Pol Handerin's farm. In 1 ABY, Lieutenant Mack Jasper of the Corellian Security Force dispatched a recruit to help Pol Handerin and deal with the problem of carrion spats. The CorSec agent killed Gravefeather and most of the pack.\nGravefeather appeared as in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nGravefeather was added to the game with the expansion Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, released on November 1, 2005. It was part of questline that featured the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat. This story arc was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"Publish 27\", on February 15, 2006, as the questline was integrated into the \"Legacy Quest\", the main questline in the game.",
