 "content": "Annabel Blaine was a female Human Force Adept who served in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nBlaine was raised by her father, an independent trader who was considered by some to be a pirate, and as a child she became fascinated with holovids that depicted members of the Jedi Order. After her father perished in a skirmish against a squadron of Imperial TIE fighters, Blaine joined the Rebel Alliance and sought revenge against the Empire. While among the Rebels, Blaine encountered a number of other Force-sensitives, who trained her to use the Force and under their tutelage, she constructed a lightsaber.\nAt some point after the destruction of the planet Alderaan, Blaine and a team of Rebel agents were dispatched by the Alliance to the planet Tazan, to destroy an Imperial Data Processing Facility that was located on the world. After arriving on Tazan, Blaine and the rest of the team rendezvoused with the Alliance sympathizer Willer Clines in Clines' house, in the Desander Section of Tazan City. However, their conversation with Clines was secretly monitored by a group of Imperial stormtroopers and once the stormtroopers believed that Rebels had revealed all that they would about their mission, the stormtroopers entered Clines' lounge and attacked Blaine and the rest of the Rebels. The agents escaped and eventually infiltrated the Data Processing Facility, where they extracted some Imperial TIE fighter communications protocols and then blew up the structure.",
