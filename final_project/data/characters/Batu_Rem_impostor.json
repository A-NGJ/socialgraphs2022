 "content": "This Human male was a bounty hunter working for the Exchange in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War.\nHoping to capitalize on the bounty that the Exchange had posted on Jedi, he assumed the identity of Batu Rem, an officer on leave from the Telos Security Force. He confronted Meetra Surik and her two companions, Kreia and Atton Rand, soon after their arrival on Citadel Station and their subsequent detainment by the TSF for their connection with the destruction of the Peragus Mining Facility.\nRem's impersonator planned to turn off the surveillance cameras and electrocute the three where they stood in their force cages. After taunting from Rand, however, he released them from their cages and attempted to fight them himself. He was no match for the trio and was killed during the skirmish.\nAt the request of TSF Lieutenant Dol Grenn, Surik later investigated the impostor's origins. She discovered that he had arrived on Telos from Nar Shaddaa, the ship he had taken landing in Czerka Corporation's private hangar.\nOriginally, the false Batu was working for the GenoHaradan, not the Exchange.",
