 "content": "Huulik was a Force-sensitive male Rodian Jedi Knight who lived in the last decades of the Galactic Republic. He served as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars against Confederacy of Independent Systems. An accomplished pilot in his own right, Huulik flew alongside Anakin Skywalker at the Battle of Sedratis, in which Skywalker saved the Rodian's life. Like most of his Jedi brethren, Huulik was killed by his own clone troopers when the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, secretly a malevolent Dark Lord of the Sith named Darth Sidious, decreed the extermination of all Jedi. Despite being mortally injured during the ambush, Huulik managed to return to his starship and set a course for his homeworld of Rodia before passing away. His family constructed a secret mausoleum for the fallen Jedi in the swamps of Rodia. Almost twenty years later, Huulik's niece Taneetch Soonta entrusted his lightsaber to Luke Skywalker.\nA male Rodian, Huulik was born into the Chekkoo clan, one of the smaller Rodian clans that hailed from the Betu continent of the planet Rodia, in the last few decades of the Galactic Republic. Huulik was discovered to be Force-sensitive and came to serve as a Knight in the Jedi Order, whose members were the protectors of peace and justice in the galaxy. He had at least one sibling, as well as a niece named Taneetch Soonta. However, the Jedi were not allowed to maintain family ties, and as a consequence, Huulik only visited his homeworld while on official Jedi business, conversing with his niece once or twice when she was a child. Despite the scarcity of his visits, he made a striking impression on her.\nTen years after the election of Sheev Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, the Clone Wars broke out between that government and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. A skilled pilot, Huulik became a general in the Grand Army of the Republic during the devastating three-year long conflict. The Rodian participated in the Battle of Sedratis, where he flew alongside his fellow Jedi Anakin Skywalker. At some point during the battle, the two Jedi were swarmed by droid starfighters and Huulik's deflector shields were depleted. However, Skywalker flew his ship in between Huulik and the next blast from the droids, saving the Rodian's life and giving him time to recharge his shields. Ultimately, the Jedi and Republic won the battle at Sedratis. Following their triumph, Huulik and Skywalker fought together on several other occasions. During one of his visits to Rodia, Huulik mentioned the Sedratis exploit to his family.\nUnbeknownst to most, the Clone Wars had in fact been orchestrated by Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith who had infiltrated the galactic government decades earlier and was none other than Chancellor Palpatine. Sidious ordered the execution of all Jedi. Consequently, Huulik was shot by the clone troopers under his command. Severely wounded, Huulik still managed to board his starship and recorded a brief message about his predicament. He also ordered his astromech droid to bring the ship back to Rodia. When Huulik's vessel landed on his homeworld, however, the Jedi had already died from his wounds. His kinsmen entombed him along with his lightsaber in a secret mausoleum, hidden among the swamps near the Chekkoo Enclave.\nNearly two decades after the demise of the Rodian Jedi during the Galactic Civil War against the Empire, Huulik's niece Soonta spoke of her uncle with the son of Anakin Skywalker, a young freedom fighter named Luke. The young Skywalker, eager to learn more about the Jedi, was pleased to hear that his father had saved Huulik's life during the war and requested to visit Huulik's mausoleum. The two recovered Huulik's lightsaber in his tomb, which assisted Skywalker in killing a wild ghest that had trapped them at the mausoleum. Luke later deconstructed the deceased Jedi's lightsaber, learning that a Jedi needed to use the Force when aligning the kyber crystals of the saber.\nAccording to his niece, Huulik seemed the very personification of honor. He was also proud of his piloting skills, although he admitted they were inferior to that of his colleague Anakin Skywalker. She additionally observed him to be an honorable individual who fought for justice.\nIn addition to being a capable pilot, Huulik could also wield a lightsaber, the characteristic weapon of the Jedi Order.\nHuulik first appeared as a corpse in the 2015 canon novel Heir to the Jedi.",
