 "content": "Nizuc Bek was a male human who was in the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt prior to the Battle of Endor. Bek was hired by Jabba the Hutt to guard celebrities visiting Jabba's palace. He was assigned to protect Sy Snootles, the Max Rebo Band's lead vocalist. When Luke Skywalker arrived and failed to persuade Jabba to release Han Solo and Chewbacca, he use the Force to possess Bek's DL-18 blaster pistol in an attempt to kill the Hutt.\nNizuc Bek was a human male who was hired by Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a  to guard celebrities visiting the Hutt's palace on the desert planet Tatooine. During the Max Rebo Band's tenure as Jabba's house band, Bek was assigned to protect its lead vocalist, the Pa'lowick Sy Snootles. In 4 ABY, Bek was stood behind Jabba's throne at the palace talking to another human when the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO were brought before Jabba by his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, and two Gamorrean guards.\nBek continued his conversation while R2-D2 played a message from the droids' master, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, in which the Jedi asked to bargain with Jabba for the freedom of the smuggler Han Solo and gifted the Hutt the two droids as a sign of good faith. As the message ended and Jabba declared he would not give up Solo, Bek and the other human moved across the court room to look at Solo, who was frozen in carbonite and displayed on Jabba's wall.\nThe next day, Bek was stood beside Jabba's throne when Skywalker confronted Jabba in the throne room and demanded that Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca be released. When Jabba refused, the Jedi used the Force to pull Bek's DL-18 blaster pistol from his belt and across the room into Skywalker's hand. Before he could fire the weapon, the Gamorrean guard Jubnuk grappled with the Jedi and both were sent tumbling down through a trap door by Jabba, ending up in the pit beneath the throne room.\nBek and the rest of the court quickly moved to a grating that looked down into the pit, and watched as Jabba's pet rancor, Pateesa, emerged and devoured Jubnuk. Their cheers were quickly silenced though, when Skywalker managed to kill Pateesa using the large door to the pit. An angry Jabba demanded that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca be brought before him, and as Bek watched, the Hutt sentenced the trio to be executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon. Bek then joined a crowd of courtiers that followed the three prisoners as they were marched from the throne room.\nIn order to view the executions, Bek traveled with Jabba on board the Hutt's sail barge, the Khetanna. Along the way, he socialized with and accepted a kiss from Sy Snootles. Upon reaching the Great Pit, Bek stood with other court members and Jabba in the barge's hold and watched the Bantha-II cargo skiff carrying the prisoners as it hovered above the maw of the sarlacc that dwelt in the pit. Jabba offered the prisoners a chance to beg for mercy, but Skywalker simply gave the Hutt one last chance to spare them, earning a laugh from the crowd. The Jedi was then pushed over the edge of the skiff, but leapt back up, now armed by R2-D2 with his lightsaber.\nAs Skywalker began cutting down the skiff guards, confusion broke out among those on the barge and the Jedi's enslaved ally, Princess Leia Organa took the opportunity to smash the controls operating the vehicle's shutters and plunge those in the hold into darkness. As the crowd rushed around in blind panic, Organa then killed Jabba by strangling him with a chain and then made her way to the top deck, where she used a deck cannon to destroy the barge before escaping with Skywalker and their other allies.\nNizuc Bek had light skin and brown hair.\nBek wore a yellow tabard with a black belt and holster and matching gauntlets and goggles. He had brown pants and boots and also wore a gray headpiece with a brown fabric neckguard that hung from the back. As well as his DL-18 blaster pistol, Bek also carried a blaster rifle.\nNizuc Bek appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. In the current Star Wars canon, Bek was first identified in the mobile card game Star Wars: Force Collection, which initially launched in 2013. Although the launch of Force Collection predates the Star Wars canon reset of 2014, Lucasfilm Story Group member Leland Chee confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon. The 2016 reference book Star Wars: Complete Locations misspelt the name as \"Nizuc Beck.\" The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on a card in the 1998 \"Jabba's Palace Limited\" set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game produced by Decipher, Inc.",
