 "content": "Philo Strom was a male Human who worked as a bounty hunter during the lifetime of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett. Strom came to be considered both honorable and among the best of his trade during his lifetime, a fact for which Fett respected him. Despite Fett's respect, the pair often did not see eye to eye, with Strom considering Fett to be scum. Strom died at some point prior to the year 2 ABY, leaving behind two sons, Edo and Rolu. The two boys also became bounty hunters, exploiting their father's name to gain a reputation neither of them was skilled enough to uphold, resulting in every mission they took being an attempt to prove themselves as good as Strom.\nPhilo Strom was first mentioned in Star Wars Adventures: Boba Fett and the Ship of Fear, a graphic novella written by Jeremy Barlow and released by Dark Horse Comics on April 27, 2011 as part of the Star Wars Adventures series.",
