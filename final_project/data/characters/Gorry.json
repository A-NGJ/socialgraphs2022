 "content": "Gorry was a male Human who was a member of the Mantellian Separatist Movement on Ord Mantell during the Cold War. He and his droid 4-SEN were stationed in the Separatist's Database warehouse at Mannett Point when the smuggler known as Ace broke in and killed an number of soldiers there.\nGorry was a male Human who lived during the Cold War on the Republic held planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system of the Mid Rim,. He was a member of the Mantellian Separatist Movement, a group who opposed the planet's corrupt central government on their support of the Galactic Republic and wished to be independent. Whilst Gorry worked for them they were engaged in the Separatist War with the government and the Republic Army.\nGorry and his droid 4-SEN were stationed for part of the war on the Separatist held island of Mannett Point. There they were amongst the soilders who guarded the Separatist's personnel database which was kept in a captured warehouse on the island. During the time they were there the smuggler known as Ace broke into the warehouse with help from a inhabitant of Mannett point named Reki. The Smuggler intended to download all the data from the database and use it to locate a Separatist named Skavak who had stolen his ship and a shipment of weapons from Rendia Freight. The Smuggler successfully reached the database after killing a number of the guards in the warehouse.\nAs the Smuggler was downloading the data 4-SEN's sensor's detected the bodies of the guards he killed and so put the warehouse's alert status on red while informing Gorry. The droid could not however detect any hostiles not realizing that Ace was an intruder. The smuggler asked Gorry when he had last calibrated 4-SEN's sensors and persuaded him they were most likely faulty and so there was no need for an alarm. Gorry agreed and he and 4-SEN moved on allowing the Smuggler to successfully complete his task and escape.\nDuring his time as a separatist Gorry wore the standard red and yellow armor and clothes of the separatists troopers. He was armed with a blaster pistol which he wore at his hip.\nGorry is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is a character involved in the smuggler classes storyline quest appearing in one mission. It is possible for the Smuggler to simply attack and kill Gorry and 4-SEN as a dark side option instead of persuading them to move on. It is not possible for players of any other faction to interact with or see Gorry unless they are in a party with a smuggler completing the mission.",
