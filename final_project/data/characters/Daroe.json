 "content": "Daroe was a male Jawa who hailed from the planet Tatooine. He lived in that planet's spaceport town of Mos Eisley, and was one of many informants for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Having inside connections with the Empire, Daroe frequently spoke with his Imperial contact, to whom he reported the Alliance to Restore the Republic's activities in the Outer Rim Territories. Daroe's equipment included an ion blaster. He had yellow eyes.\nDaroe was created for the Tatooine Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
