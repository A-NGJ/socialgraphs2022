 "content": "Birt was a chubby Sullustan male with a gummy smile who worked as a camera operator for the HoloNet News. In the year 5 ABY, he and reporter Tracene Kane filmed a statement from Chancellor Mon Mothma of the New Republic in the early morning on the planet Chandrila regarding allegations that she had been concealing knowledge of the Galactic Empire's presence on the planet Jakku from the public. Before the interview, Birt was the one to connect the hovering camera to the holoprojector platform and confirmed in Sullustese that the equipment was ready for the chancellor. He then operated the equipment during the recording and cut the feed once it was over.\nBirt first appeared in the 2017 novel Aftermath: Empire's End, which was written by Chuck Wendig.",
