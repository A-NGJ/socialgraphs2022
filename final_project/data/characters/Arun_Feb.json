 "content": "Arun Feb was an asteroid miner who worked as the assistant to supervisor Vett Fori for an outfit based on Oseon 2795. A short, stocky man, Feb was relatively well-traveled, having seen the massive, mysterious ruins of the long-vanished Sharu in the Rafa system, and having beheld dinosaurs on Trammis III. In his off-hours, Feb entertained himself with games of sabaccâ€”Feb, Fori and several others played a game with offworld gambler and smuggler Lando Calrissian in 3 BBY. Although Feb left the game before Calrissian completely cleaned him out, he stayed long enough to witness local Constable T. Lund Phuna attempt to frame Calrissian for cheating and arrest him. Not willing to let Calrissian suffer such injustice, Feb and Fori knocked Phund unconscious and allowed the offworlder to escape.",
