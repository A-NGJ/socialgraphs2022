He later moved to the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant and became a police officer with the Coruscant Police Force. During his career, Galt arrested a negotiator from a defense contractor resulting in the collapse of a business deal. The Techno Union, a hopeful participant in the collapsed deal, issued a bounty on Galt for 2,000 credits to paid for Galt's death.\nIn 32 BBY, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett found Galt in Coruscant's Financial District.
