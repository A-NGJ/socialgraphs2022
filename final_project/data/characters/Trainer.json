 "content": "Trainer was a muscular Human male who was alive by the year 5 ABY, during the reign of the New Republic. Trainer had brown hair, gray eyes, and light colored skin. He carried a lightsaber with a blue blade and a Bryar pistol. He would use his lightsaber to trim his facial hair. Trainer wore a black sleeveless shirt with a red stripe that went down the right side of it. He also wore a pair of matching pants that continued the stripe, and he wore a gray shoulder pad.\nTrainer's only appearance was in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, a video game released on September 30, 1997. He only appeared in the game's multiplayer portion as a playable character model. As a default, characters had both a lightsaber and Bryar pistol as their starting weapons, with the default lightsaber color being blue. As such, this article assumes that Trainer owned both items.",
