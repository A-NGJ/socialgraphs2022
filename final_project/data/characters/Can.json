 "content": "Can was the nickname of a clone trooper who served the Grand Army of the Republic as a pilot from Gold Squadron during the Clone Wars.\nIn 21 BBY, he fought alongside Gold Squadron under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Battle of Lanteeb. When General Grievous hijacked a separatist ship, Can along with Gold Squad received orders to destroy the ship in the direction of the blockade. Therefore, they took up the chase and opened fire at the ship, but it was not badly damaged. After the squad was ambushed by droid fighters, Can and Fireball flew back in the direction of the Republic fleet which gave them enough time for all the droid fighters to be shot down by every blast.",
