 "content": "Sentepeth Findos was a male Neimoidian, who post-Clone Wars as the Acting Viceroy of the Trade Federation handled control of the organisation to the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY.\nFindos served as a lieutenant with the Separatist Droid Army during the siege of Cato Neimoidia, where he gave an order to send more B1-Series battle droids against Jedi Master Kit Fisto.\nFindos later became Acting Viceroy of the Trade Federation immediately after the deaths of Nute Gunray, Rune Haako, and Rute Gunnay on Mustafar. Findos's appointment was presumably \"acting\" due to the fact that only a few members of the Imperial government were aware of the fate of the former Separatist Council.\nAfter a few days of resisting the new regime, he was reluctantly forced by Imperial stormtroopers on Neimoidia to sign a treaty granting the new self-appointed Emperor Palpatine all of the Trade Federation's resources following the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY. He was then escorted to an unknown location by a squad of stormtroopers. Despite this, however, one of the Trade Federation officials, Customs Vizier Marath Vooro, disagreed with the treaty and fought the Empire until he was captured at Hook Nebula.",
