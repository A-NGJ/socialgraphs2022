 "content": "Jard was a male Human Sith commander in the Imperial navy who was in command of the battlecruiser Valor that belonged to the Sith Lord Darth Malgus.\nCaptain Jard usually oversaw operations on the ship while Malgus was on planet and was one of the ranking officers of the blockade fleet during and immediately after the Sacking of Coruscant. Jard was often contacted by Malgus to check in on various tasks. After the injury of Malgus's lover Eleena Daru, Malgus learned from Jard that she had not been taken aboard the ship. Jard was also present when the bounty hunter Vrath Xizor was taken aboard Valor. He reported different updates to Malgus while the ship Fatman was shot down over Coruscant. Jard was later ordered to allow Aryn Leneer to leave the planet, after he spared her.",
