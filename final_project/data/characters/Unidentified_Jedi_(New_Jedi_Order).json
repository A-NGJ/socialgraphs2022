 "content": "This Jedi was a member of Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order one year after the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 was founded.\nIn 12 ABY, this Jedi, along with his fellow Jedi trainees, was taught in the ways of the Force by a Jedi trainer. He later helped Kyle Katarn and a Jedi trainer fend of against Desann's dark side minions. As a full-fledged Jedi Knight, this Jedi survived the battle on Yavin IV.\nThis Jedi joined Luke's rank as a Jedi Master in the New Jedi Order by 14 ABY, and participated in the Jedi-lead strike on Korriban that ended the threat posed by the Disciples of Ragnos.\nThis Jedi wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber with a Retaliator-style hilt.\nThe Jedi was introduced as a skin used by multiple NPCs in Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, but he was later treated as an individual character toward the end of the game and also throughout Jedi Academy.\nIn Jedi Outcast the Jedi was voiced by Dominic Armato, Jedi Academy, by Dee Bradley Baker.\nIn Jedi Outcast, the lightsaber style that this Jedi used would indicate that he was a Jedi Knight towards the end of the game.",
