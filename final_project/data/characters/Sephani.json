 "content": "Sephani was the Mosciive Empress of the Inner Rim planet known as Simocadia, the mother of prince Yojan and a good friend of the Jedi Master Mace Windu.\nDuring the Clone Wars Simocadia was contested by both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, despite her wishes to remain neutral. Her son Yojan had joined the CIS and used the planets resources to awaken the Ardana Shadex atone giant and destroy the agrocite mines in order to make both sides of the Clone Wars lose interest in their planet. Even though Mace Windu saved the Empress from a Separatist Droid Army, she refused him any help in actions against her son. Windu confronted the prince anyway, and Yojan choose to activate the Ardana Shadex, when the Jedi unintentionally destroyed the glass key - its control module. The giant was awakened and not only crashed the mine, but attempted to destroy the city as well. Windu, Yojan and Demo escaped in a Neimoidian Sheathipede-class transport shuttle and, joining their forces against the threat, managed to destroy the giant, by the costing Yojan his life.",
