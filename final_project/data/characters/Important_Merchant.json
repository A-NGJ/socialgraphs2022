 "content": "The Important Merchant was a male Human merchant who lived in the city of Mos Espa on the planet of Tatooine during the blockade of Naboo. He sold various supplies at a stand, being a great asset to Qui-Gon Jinn during his stay at Tatooine. He was also repairing a Titan 2150 podracer in the back of his shop, which he intended to sell for use in the Boonta Eve Classic.\nAt his shop, he was willing to sell any of his items, but only for the right price. He was eventually approached by Qui-Gon Jinn, who needed parts to repair Anakin Skywalker's podracer. He turned to the Important Merchant, who had a Mass coupler, one of the parts needed to fix the podracer, but he was cautious to deal with Jinn after hearing that he only carried Republic credits. Qui-Gon offered a trade, but he wasn't interested in anything the Jedi was carrying. Upon being prompted, though, he stated that he would accept two Fuel converters, or a Fusion coil and an Engine binder for the Mass coupler. They reached an agreement, and Jinn obtained the Mass coupler for Anakin.\nThe Important Merchant's podracer was eventually sold to Ratts Tyerell, who raced with it in the Boonta Eve Classic, but was killed after crashing it on the second lap.\nThe Important Merchant made his first and only appearance in the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game in the Mos Espa level, where he is voiced by Joe Alaskey. He shares the same character model with Anabar and various other Tatooinians. In the mission, the player, in the guise of Jinn, must acquire parts to repair Skywalker's podracer by completing several side-quests.",
