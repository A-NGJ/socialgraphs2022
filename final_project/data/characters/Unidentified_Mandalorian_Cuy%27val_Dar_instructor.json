 "content": "A Mandalorian was recruited into the Cuy'val Dar by bounty hunter Jango Fett to help train the clone commandos of the Grand Army of the Republic. One of seventy-five other Mandalorian training sergeants that comprised the one-hundred person strong Cuy'val Dar the instructor trained numerous clone cadets for commando operations while on Kamino, and passed along knowledge of the Mandalorian culture to his clone trainees. One of the soldiers under his tutelage, who went by the self-assigned name of Kaddak, came to have a contentious relationship with the Mandalorian instructor. The two eventually fought, and using nothing but his bare hands alone, Kaddak killed the instructor.\nThe Mandalorian instructor wore a suit of Mandalorian armor while training the clone troops assigned to him, as well as a jetpack and cape.\nThe unidentified Mandalorian instructor first appeared in Star Wars canon in the second issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Cry of Shadows, authored by Tim Siedell and published January 14, 2013.",
