 "content": "Hela Madiry was a Human female clerk, nearing retirement age, who worked for GAR logistics center on Coruscant during the Clone Wars. She had a number of distant cousins on Jabiim, and was secretly providing information about GAR troop movement to a Separatist terror cell operating on Coruscant. Her identity as a mole was traced through a series of terrorist bombings targeting military facilities on Coruscant by the Gurlanin, Jinart, who passed this information on to Kal Skirata, leader of a Republic anti-terror special forces group.\nWhile reading a holozine on her break 385 days after the First Battle of Geonosis, Hela Madiry was shot twice in the head and once in the chest by Ordo Skirata—posing as clone trooper Corr—killing her.",
