 "content": "Cav'Saran was a Human male Patroller Chief of Janusar on Ranklinge during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0.5 ABY, he took power eight months before then, and confiscated all weapons within a 200-kilometer radius. As no Imperial ships came by Ranklinge, it made him and his enforcers the effective masters of the city. He had connections with BloodScar, who set him up to steal Incom I-7 attack starfighters. He was killed by the Hand of Judgment after a couple of his patrollers and the rest were arrested by former incorruptible members, including Colonel Atmino.",
