 "content": "Orman was a male Chev businessman who lived on Lianna. He had extensive black market connections, and was an occasional spy for the Galactic Empire.\nLike many Chev who had escaped slavery, he expressed the individuality which would normally have been suppressed by a Chevin master by dyeing his hair and skin in bright colors—in his case, his skin was iridescent blue and his hair was silver. He was also always accompanied by a group of thugs who acted as bodyguards—possibly due to the common fear free Chevs had of being forced back into bondage.\nIn Orman's character template, his species is given incorrectly as Chevin.",
