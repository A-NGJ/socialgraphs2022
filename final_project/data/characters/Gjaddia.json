 "content": "Gjaddia was a male Human who worked in Just Armor, which was a store supplying personal armor and starship armor that was located in the market of the space station StarForge Station. By 0 ABY, Gjaddia was the businessman for the shop, while fellow Human Morol took care of armor fittings and repair.\nGjaddia first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates \u0026 Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering vessel Far Orbit.",
