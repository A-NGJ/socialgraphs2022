 "content": "\"Axe\" was the nickname of a clone trooper pilot who served within of the Galactic Republic naval forces' Blue Squadron during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, a Republic fleet under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker was dispatched to the planet Ryloth in order to break through the Confederacy of Independent Systems' orbiting blockade led by Neimoidian Captain Mar Tuuk. During the battle, Axe and the rest of Blue Squadron, led by Skywalker's Padawan, Jedi Commander and Blue Leader Ahsoka Tano, was launched against the blockade, where they were engaged by several Vulture-class droid starfighters.\nHowever, after the Republic became overwhelmed following the arrival of additional Separatist reinforcements, Blue Squadron, which had lost several of its ten pilots, was ordered to withdraw. Amid their retreat, though, Axe was killed by a vulture droid before successfully returning to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute in order for the Republic to flee the system.\nLike all clone troopers serving in the Republic Military, Axe was created by the Kaminoans for the sole purpose of serving the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, Axe served as Blue Leader, flying a V-19 Torrent starfighter under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer, Resolute.\nIn 21 BBY, Axe stepped aside so Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano could take the position of Squadron Commander for the first time, which led to him assuming the title of Blue Two. He and the rest of Blue Squadron were deployed to serve in the Battle of Ryloth in an attempt to break the Separatist Ryloth blockade. Under the command of Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, the squadron attempted to break the Separatist blockade around the planet. When the Separatist reinforcements arrived in the system, Commander Tano recklessly delayed the squadron's withdrawal, despite commands from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen to return to the Resolute immediately.\nDuring the retreat, Axe would take Tano's right wing while Swoop and Kickback took the forward positions. Axe's power converters would begin to fail and as he was trying to fix it, he was killed by three Vulture-class droid starfighters tailing his V-19.",
