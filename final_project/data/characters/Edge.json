 "content": "\"Edge\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic's Tango Company during the Clone Wars.\nTango Company was assigned to escort a medical frigate to an Ord Cestus medical station under the command of Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee. However, Tango Company trooper Scythe was infected with a Geonosian brain worm and secretly brought a batch of eggs aboard the ship. As the infection spread throughout the ship, Edge became aware that his fellow troopers were acting strangely. However, he was too late, as he too was infected. As Edge was the last uninfected clone on board, they attacked their next targets, Tano and Offee. They eventually infected Offee, but were later saved by Tano.\nEdge wielded a DC-15A blaster carbine as well as a DC-15A blaster rifle. His helmet sported blue markings on the arms and the Tango Company logo, which was a tiger's face. He had a tattoo of the Aurebesh letter Senth over his left eyebrow.",
