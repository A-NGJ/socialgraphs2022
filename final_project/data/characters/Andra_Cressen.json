 "content": "Andra Cressen was a Human female from Alderaan who was the daughter of Major Corlis Brado Cressen.\nDuring the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire, Andra, against her father's wishes, infiltrated House Rist as a lowly servant girl. She held information that could affect her father's plan to attack House Ulgo until her cover was blown and she was taken captive by House Rist. She was rescued by a Republic individual who sent by her father to rescue her.\nWhen the individual confronted the Rist guards at her cell, Andra flippantly told them that the former was a friend of hers and that they were outmatched. The guards threatened to kill Andra if the spacer made a move but they were all killed before they could carry out their threat. Once freed, Andra gave the individual a datapad detailing Ulgo's plan to demolish a bridge to stop the Organa army. Shortly after, she announced her intention to go undercover at House of Thul.\nAndra later sent her rescuer a message, explaining that she had successful made her infiltration as a long-lost Thul cousin.\nAndra Cressen is a NPC characters in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic video game voiced by Ali Hillis.\nAt the end of the rescue mission, the player can choose to either permit Andra to remain undercover  or force her to abandon her mission .",
