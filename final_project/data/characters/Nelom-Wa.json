 "content": "Nelom-Wa was a Voss Mystic living on Voss many years before the planet was discovered by the galactic society. His vision led to replacing a great leader of the Three with an infant child. This action saved the great leader's life during a plague, allowing him to reform the Three afterwards. Nelom-Wa recorded the event in the Writings of Nelom-Wa that were etched on a pillar erected outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths.",
