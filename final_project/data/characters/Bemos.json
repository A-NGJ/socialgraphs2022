 "content": "Bemos was a Human male Moff on the Moff Council. He wore a large codoran ring.\nIn 19 ABY, he took part in the conference where Admiral Gilad Pellaeon was planning to open peace negotiations to the New Republic. Bemos was excited and opposed to negotiating with the New Republic, believing that it would self-destruct soon anyway. This view was shared by Andray, but Pellaeon refuted that the New Republic would ensure that the remnants of the Empire would not collapse. In the end, Bemos agreed to have the treaty signed which led to the end of the Galactic Civil War.",
