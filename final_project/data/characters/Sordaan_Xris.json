 "content": "Sordaan Xris was a male Rodian who lived on the planet Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe wealthiest of his species on Kashyyyk, Xris established Sordaan Xris' Safari Partners and what became known as the Rodian Hunting Grounds, which offered big-game hunting on the Wookiee homeworld. Tired of people seeing him as a weak hunter, Xris set out to kill the legendary Kkorrwrot, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Xris used the Bocctyyy sub-region of Etyyy as his personal hunting grounds, and often made wagers with fellow hunters pertaining to feats performed within Bocctyyy.\nSordaan Xris appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
