 "content": "Saldith was a male Ithorian Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the final years of the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive male Ithorian, Saldith was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order; eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master after years of study and service. As a Master, Saldith took on a Jedi Initiate named Sha Koon as his Padawan. Training the young Kel Dor to temper her strong connection to the Force, Saldith discovered that Koon could play an important role in the ongoing Stark Hyperspace War; a conflict in which her uncle Plo Koon actively participated in. Knowing that the Jedi High Council had lost touch with the Jedi in the field, Master Saldith presented Koon as a way of contacting the wayward Jedi. Confident in her Force abilities and her connection with her uncle, the Ithorian and the Council members bolstered Koon's strength to successfully reach out to Jedi Koon during the fighting.",
