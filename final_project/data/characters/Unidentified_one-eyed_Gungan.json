 "content": "A one-eyed Gungan was a mercenary working for Attuma Duum around 21 BBY. During that year, the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura attempted to arrest Duum, but she was forced to flee. This Gungan, wearing modified clone trooper armor and carrying a blaster, joined Sabat, Duum's chief of security, and other mercenaries to hunt down Secura on the moon of Cavamina Minor. They cornered Secura, but she ran; the rogue Force-sensitive Shon-Ju and his students intervened and attacked the mercenaries. This Gungan was knocked aside by an Ithorian. Sabat fled before Shon-Ju could engage him in personal combat, allowing Shon-Ju to treat Secura's injuries.\nThis individual appears in a scene in the 2010 graphic novella The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju.",
