 "content": "Mas was a male Moorjhoni who lived on the planet Moorjhone in 20 BBY. When he tripped while preparing to attack Ja'Boag's mine, his brother Mootai helped him up. Maul scolded Mootai for doing so, and when Mootai later tripped, Mas left him behind. During the battle, Mas believed Maul when he said Obi-Wan Kenobi and his clone troopers were there to stop the Moorjhoni.",
