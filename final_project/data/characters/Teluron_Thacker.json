 "content": "Teluron Thacker was a member of a species that hailed from the planet Eeyyon. He was the contact for the Jedi on Korriban, who was to give them information on the whereabouts of Granta Omega. Teluron and Obi-Wan Kenobi chatted in a diner, where they got all they needed to know about where Omega and Jenna Zan Arbor had gone to.\nLater, when the Jedi needed a starship, Teluron gave them one, while he was all frightened and jittery. The Jedi knew that he'd betrayed them when the Security Forces tried to blow them out of the sky.",
