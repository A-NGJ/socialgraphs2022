 "content": "A clone trooper captain served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Around 21 BBY, he was stationed on the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility, which was sent to the planet Rodia to escort Separatist Council member Nute Gunray to the galactic capital of Coruscant. During the trip, the Star Destroyer was attacked by Confederate battle droids in boarding ships. Later, the captain was checking the reactor room of the ship together with a fellow trooper, but the clones did not notice anything unusual. The two then left the reactor room, continuing to the prison level of the ship in order to repel the remaining battle droids.\nA clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, a clone trooper captain was born on the planet Kamino to fight in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army. Around 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, when Separatist Council member Nute Gunray was captured on the planet Rodia, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility was sent to Rodia to escort Gunray to the galactic capital of Coruscant. The captain was one of the many clone troopers on board the Tranquility when it departed from Rodia. Confederate leader Count Dooku, however, sent the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress to either rescue or kill Gunray, who possessed valuable Confederate secrets.\nVentress launched an attack on the ship, with several boarding ships penetrating the hull of the Tranquility. B2 super battle droids dismounted from the boarding ships and advanced toward the prison level, while the Dark Acolyte infiltrated the reactor room of the Tranquility. The captain and a fellow trooper were patrolling the ship and arrived in the reactor room. They did not, however, notice Ventress, who was stealthily planting explosives on the reactors in order to cripple the ship. The troopers told 327-T, a WED-15 Treadwell droid inspecting the reactor room, to watch for intruders, before locking down the room. The captain contacted Clone Commander CC-1004, stating that the reactor room was checked. The commander told the two clones to head for the prison level, where the remaining super battle droids were fighting. Ventress was later able to escape with Gunray.\nWhen his fellow trooper instructed the droid 327-T, whom he nicknamed \"327,\" to keep watch in the reactor room of the Tranquility, the captain informed him that droids did not like to be called by their nicknames.\nThe Captain first appeared in the ninth episode of the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, \"Cloak of Darkness,\" which aired on December 5, 2008. Like all clone troopers in the series, the Captain is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.",
