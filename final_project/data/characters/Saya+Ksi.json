 "content": "Saya Ksi was an outcast Twi'lek female who established herself as an influential bounty hunter clan leader. At some point following the conclusion of the Battle of Ruusan, Ksi came together with the bounty hunters Keekrim Pon, Teesoo and Thrassk to resurrect the defunct Bounty Hunters' Guild of old as the \"New Bounty Hunters Guild,\" in an effort to revitalize the bounty-hunting profession. Together, Ksi, Pon, Teeloo and Thrassk authored the Bounty Hunters' Creed, the guiding principles for members of the new guild.",
