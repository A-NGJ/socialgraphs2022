 "content": "Si was a Gran exile and a commander within the Galactic Alliance Defense Force in 28 ABY. He was based on the planet Esfandia which was home to the Brrbrlpp. During his off-duty hours at the Galactic Alliance base, he studied the Brrbrlpp and studied their language and culture. He also taught the natives how to speak Trinary since their tongue was difficult for offworlders to understand.",
