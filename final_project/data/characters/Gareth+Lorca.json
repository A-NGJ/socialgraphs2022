 "content": "Gareth Lorca was a Human male Jedi who was active during the reign of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire between 130 ABY and 138 ABY. Lorca had brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin. Additionally, he had a large scar that extended from his left jaw up across his face to his right temple. A smaller secondary scar was featured on his left eyebrow.\nLorca was clothed in dark brown Jedi apparel that featured various straps along his shoulders and a spot on his belt in which to clip his lightsabers. He wore gloves on both hands and sported tall black boots that extended up toward his knees. On his face, Lorca wore a single cybernetic left eye covering and sported a single red dot on his forehead. Lorca dual-wielded two orange lightsabers.\nGareth Lorca is a character created for Red Fly Studio's canceled video game Battle of the Sith Lords. He was planned to be one of several Jedi adversaries, including Bix Creo and Nexus Wan, whom Maul's descendant would have encountered throughout the game. Concept artist Thomas A. Szakolczay designed Lorca's appearance at some point prior to the game's cancelation in 2011.",
