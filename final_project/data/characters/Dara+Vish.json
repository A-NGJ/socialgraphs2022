 "content": "Dara Vish was a human female proprietor who worked at the Common House of the planet Sorgan. Around 9 ABY, she served grinjer bone broth and spotchka to the Mandalorian Din Djarin and his young companion, Grogu, the former of whom bribed Vish so that she would speed up his order. Djarin also inquired Vish about a local named Cara Dune.\nDara Vish was a human female who worked as a proprietor at the Common House on the planet Sorgan. In 9 ABY, she had taken down a creature known as a grinjer, which provided for plenty of bone broth for the Common House. Shortly afterward, the Mandalorian Din Djarin and the infant Grogu visited the planet and then the house, where Vish welcomed them and took Djarin's order: bone broth for Grogu. She offered the Mandalorian broth as well, but he declined.\nHe then took interest in the nearby human Cara Dune, inquiring about how long she had been there and what she was doing; Vish thought that she had seen Dune for around a week and then chuckled, for there was not much business on Sorgan. Djarin then slipped her some credits, prompting Vish to assure the Mandalorian that his meal would come as soon as possible and that she would additionally serve him a flagon of spotchka. After noticing that Dune had left her seat, Djarin walked outside, tossing an additional coin to Vish in exchange for her watching Grogu for him. In that year, Vish was later present in the building when Dune fought a Zabrak fighter, standing behind the bar and watching the tussle.\nDara Vish was willing to accept bribes in exchange for better service, assuring Djarin that his food would come as soon as possible after he gave credits to her and even adding free spotchka to the order. She had black hair, light skin, and hazel-colored eyes.\nDara Vish first appeared in \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary,\" the fourth episode of the live-action series The Mandalorian's first season. The episode aired on November 29, 2019. In the episode, she was portrayed by Ida Darvish and was identified in the closing credits only as \"Common House Proprietor.\" Her name of \"Dara Vish,\" a tuckerization of Darvish's name, was given in the 2021 young readers reference book Star Wars: The Mandalorian Handbook by Matt Jones.",
