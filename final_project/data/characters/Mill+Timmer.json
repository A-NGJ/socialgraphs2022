 "content": "Mill Timmer was a male Human from the planet Corellia who served as an officer with the Coruscant Police Force during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nMill Timmer was a male Human who originated from the planet Corellia. He became a police officer with the Coruscant Police Force on the Galactic Republic capital Coruscant. Timmer, however, became a dirty cop and was one the take. At one point he took more than he was supposed to causing the crime lord Sebolto to put a 2,500 credit bounty out for Timmer's death.\nIn 32 BBY, Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett found Timmer in Coruscant's Financial District. Fett managed to shoot and kill Timmer and collected on the bounty.\nTimmer was a Human male with dark eyes and light skin. When on duty, he wore his CSF uniform and carried a blaster.\nMill Timmer first appeared in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter a single player game released on December 5, 2002. The player can choose to pursue Mill Timmer's bounty though it is not required to move to the next level. He also had an entry in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide which was published on November 26, 2002.",
