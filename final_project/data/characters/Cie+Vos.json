 "content": "Cie Vos was male Zabrak criminal who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin, Cie Vos worked for Lady Valarian's criminal syndicate on the planet Tatooine.\nIn 1 ABY, Vos discovered that Lady Valarian was for some reason poisoning some of the patrons of the Lucky Despot. The man therefore stole a box of toxic rations to prove his point. Declared an enemy of the syndicate, Valarian's lieutenant Kavas Urdano tasked a spacer with killing Vos and retrieving the stolen rations. When the spacer approached Vos, outside the city of Mos Eisley. he insisted that the rations were poisonous, and that he wanted to bring the rations as proof to the authorities. Although he begged not to be killed, the spacer did so anyway, along with two fellow thugs who were defending him. The spacer returned the toxic rations to Urdano, who awarded the spacer with 2,000 credits.\nCie Vos was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Cie Vos was present in the original release of the game, being part of Lady Valarian's Quest Series.\nBecause Cie Vos spawned under the generic \"jabba_thief\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions. He could either appear as a male Zabrak or as a Human female. Because the quest dialogue identified Vos as male, this article assumes that the male Zabrak depiction is canon in the Star Wars Legends continuity.\nWith the release of the \"Publish 23\" on August 31, 2005, Lady Valarian's Quest Series was deactivated and Cie Vos was consequently removed from the game.",
