 "content": "Caratoo was a grizzled Kerk male who led a band of mercenaries during the High Republic Era. The former Jedi Ty Yorrick joined Caratoo's band, and one of the first things that he had taught her was to know where her limits were. Despite his words, Caratoo was not above betraying those who trusted him. At some point, however, Caratoo turned his back on Yorrick, who would eventually work on her own as a mercenary.",
