During the invasion of Belsavis, Byten dispatched a unit to retrieve Prince Shange, a Cathar who had opposed his species' joining the Galactic Republic and was imprisoned on Belsavis. Though Byten's unit was wiped out, he was able to recruit other Imperials in the area to free Shange, allowing the Empire to spin Shange's story in an attempt to break the Cathar loyalty to the Republic.\nCommander Byten appears in a cutscene on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where provides Imperial players with the mission \"Once and Future.\"",
