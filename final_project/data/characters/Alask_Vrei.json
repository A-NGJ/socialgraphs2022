 "content": "Colonel Alask Vrei was a male Twi'lek baron of a clan. He lost his holdings, but discovered a talent for starship tactics. He then became an officer.\nVrei was decorated for bravery during his service, and was outwardly aloof, and treated his crew as subjects, but also played hardball if need be. He was considered to be harsh but fair.\nHe used a hold-out blaster, datapad, commlink, holoprojector, and recording rods in the military. He could speak Basic, Lekku, and Ryl.\nAlask Vrei is used as an example of a character in the Star Wars Roleplaying Game in the 2002 article On Wings of Rogues in Star Wars Gamer 9.",
