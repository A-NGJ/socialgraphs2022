 "content": "Josen Shire was a Human male slave of the Serpent Masters of Ophideraan during the era of the Galactic Civil War, and the father of Tanith Shire. Shire and his daughter crash-landed on Ophideraan a number of years before 0 ABY and forced into servitude by the Serpent Masters, a clan of lizard-riding bandits who ruled the barren planet.\nAfter some years toiling to maintain the planet's Great Well, Shire's daughter Tanith—who was allowed to work offworld, steering salvage wrecks towards Ophideraan—returned with Rebel agent Luke Skywalker in tow. Shire became acquainted with the young Force-user during his time on Ophideraan, and ran interference for Skywalker as he worked to overthrow the Serpent Masters and free those they subjugated.\nJosen Shire first appeared in The Serpent Masters, a story arc of the the Star Wars comic strip written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1981, where he was illustrated by Al Williamson. Although Shire goes unnamed in his initial appearance, his first name was later given in his daughter Tanith's Databank entry.",
