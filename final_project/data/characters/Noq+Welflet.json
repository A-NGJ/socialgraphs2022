 "content": "Noq Welflet was a male Human Captain who led his troops in battle among the warring tribes of Haariden during the time of the Separatist Crisis.\nIn 26 BBY, Welflet took payment from Granta Omega to hunt down Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in exchange for food and clothing for his beleaguered soldiers. In turn, Welflet opened fire on Kenobi's Jedi team who were sent to rescue a group of scientists, who had discovered for themselves a holdout in the besieged countryside village of Tenuuri.\nBelieving that Omega had lied to him and his men, the gaunt and weary Welflet ordered a cease-fire to allow the Jedi to escape from the planet with the scientists they'd rescued.\nIn the end, when the Jedi returned to Haariden in their renewed pursuit of Omega, the overproud Welflet and his troops, despite Kenobi's warnings to evacuate, were caught in the Kaachtari volcano eruption that caused a massive landslide of rock and lava, killing them all.",
