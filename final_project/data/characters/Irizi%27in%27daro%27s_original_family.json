 "content": "A poor family was part of the Chiss Ascendancy. Some of its members lived in the Oyokal farming community, where the Chiss female who would become Xodlak'in'daro was born. That Chiss joined the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet and was rematched into the Great Xodlak family as a merit adoptive, gaining the name Xodlak'in'daro and the core name \"Lakinda.\"\nIn the aftermath of the Hoxim incident, Lakinda was castigated by the Patriarch of the Xodlak family for failing to secure the world's purported reserves of the precious metal nyix for the family. Lakinda worried that she might be detached from the Xodlak and rematched to her original family in the Oyokal farming community, but was instead offered a position to join the Nine Ruling Families' Irizi family as a Trial-born. Lakinda accepted the position with the Irizi, becoming Irizi'in'daro with the core name \"Ziinda.\"\nThe family was mentioned in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good, the second installment of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy.",
