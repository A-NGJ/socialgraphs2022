 "content": "Quilljayk was a male Ithorian Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Ithorian, Quilljayk was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, and eventually attained the rank of Jedi Master. Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, Master Quilljayk returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there.\nSelecting the young Human Flingeld as his Padawan, he strove to instill the Human with the tenets of the Jedi Code and teach his student to be accountable for his actions. When time came for Flingeld to face the Trials of Knighthood, Quilljayk assigned him to levitate a massive boulder and retrieve the contents underneath it. When Flingled gave into frustration, he asked another Padawan to assist him.\nHaving failed his Master's test, which was truly to admit defeat gracefully, Quilljayk deemed the boy unfit to continue the training and assigned him to work in the Archives as a clerk, never to attain a rank in the Order.",
