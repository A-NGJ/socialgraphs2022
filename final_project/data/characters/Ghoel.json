 "content": "Ghoel was a Wol Cabasshite male who resided in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine during the period of the Galactic Civil War. An adaptive being sometimes mistaken for a pest, mollusk-like Ghoel often glued himself to the palace's walls and arches, and used his prehensile tongue to lick other occupants of the court. He was present in the palace audience chamber in 4 ABY when Luke Skywalker delivered a message to Jabba the Hutt, and later licked C-3PO as the protocol droid translated Jabba's condemnation of Skywalker and his Rebel friends.\nGhoel appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. A prototype model of the character with a forked tongue was designed for the film. Epoxy was used on areas of the final costume to make it look wet. The character was listed as number ten on list of creatures being made for the film from November 4, 1981, which gave its production nicknames as \"Low Clearance\" and \"Wol Cabasshite,\" which would become the name of its species, but also just referred to as \"Slug.\" In the current Star Wars canon, the character was first identified as Ghoel in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia.",
