 "content": "A clone was stationed in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center in the Galactic City on Coruscant.\nAround 21 BBY, when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised himself as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and infiltrated the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center to uncover a plot to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, this clone was working in the detention facility's cremation center.\nAfter the undercover Jedi along with prisoners Cad Bane and Moralo Eval started a prison riot in the mess hall, they managed to evade the prison guards and used the morgue to escape, hiding inside caskets which were sent to the cremation center. This clone along with three others were working in the cremation center when the incident happened, and this one detected life signs inside one of the arriving coffins. When a fellow clone started checking the caskets, the prisoners jumped out and started attacking them. This clone grabbed his DC-15S and tried to fire at Cad Bane, but he used another guard as a shield, and then tackled this clone, stealing his blaster and shooting him with it.\nThe clone first appeared in the fifteenth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' fourth season, titled \"Deception\". He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, the actor who portrays all of the clone troopers in the series.",
