 "content": "Myles was a male Human who was a pilot in Dagger Wing, a unit of the Republic Navy during the Great Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. Like the rest of the unit, Myles was imprisoned in Belsavis prison after the bombing of Fest, and joined his unit in aiding the prison staff in keeping order. During the invasion of Belsavis, Myles and his friend Adan accompanied their commander Conrad Gall to secure Maximum Security Pod J-P7, but Gall and a number of pilots pursued a group of Imperials led by the Sith Lord Ondorruâ€”the man who had tricked Dagger Wing into attacking civilians on Fest. Adan and Myles stayed hidden until they were found by Havoc Squad, and told the soldiers about Gall's departure.\nMyles appears in the Trooper class mission \"Slicing the Net\" in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. If players do not complete the bonus mission \"Commando Hunt\" on the way to Maximum Security Pod J-P7, Adan will be shot and killed by the Imperial commandos that the player was supposed to kill. This article assumes 100% completion, and thus that Adan survived.",
