 "content": "Jordo was a male Human from Telos IV who served as a soldier with the Republic Military, serving alongside Carth Onasi for a time. However, while Carth stayed on with the fleet after the devastation of Telos, Jordo left, taking a job with Czerka Corporation. Some years later, he informed Carth of the fate of his son, Dustil, stating that he was alive and had joined the Sith Empire as a student at the Sith Academy on Korriban.\nJordo only appears if the player leaves the Ebon Hawk with Carth in their party, and only after having talked with Carth about his past and learning of the fate of his family.",
