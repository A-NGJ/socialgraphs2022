 "content": "Davod Jon was a Human male colonel who served the Galactic Empire as a Special Forces leader in the Galactic Civil War. Jon was promoted for his skills and bravery as a scout. In 4 ABY, Jon was present for the Dark Lord Darth Vader's arrival aboard the Empire's second Death Star battlestation, and afterward for the arrival of Emperor Palpatine. Jon would serve under Admiral Firmus Piett during the Battle of Endor.\nDavod Jon was a Human male who served as a colonel in the Galactic Empire. As an officer of the Imperial Army, Jon was promoted for his skills and bravery as a scout. He served as a leader in the Empire's Special Forces unit.\nShortly before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Jon was among the many Imperial personnel present when the Dark Lord Darth Vader arrived aboard the second Death Star to coerce the battlestation's commander, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, to quicken the superweapon's construction, to which Jerjerrod responded that his construction crews would double their efforts. Afterward, Jon stood in one of the Death Star's hangar bays alongside Vader and other officers to await the arrival of Emperor Palpatine aboard the battlestation. Jon went on to serve under Admiral Firmus Piett, the commanding officer of the Star Dreadnought Executor and Death Squadron, Vader's personal fleet, during the Battle of Endor.\nDavod Jon was known as a proficient leader. Despite the Empire's obvious technological superiority over opponents, Jon advocated the development of wilderness survival training for Imperial troops and convinced his superiors that wilderness survival and recon training were also necessary for military dominance.\nJon had brown hair that was graying with age and light skin.\nColonel Jon wore the standard-issue Imperial officer's uniform.\nDavod Jon first appeared as one of the many Imperial personnel awaiting Darth Vader's arrival on the second Death Star in the opening scene of 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The character was portrayed by an uncredited actor, and was later on given a name and a brief backstory in the 2000 Death Star II Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.\nSeveral images found on T-bone's Star Wars Universe fan Web site show that Davod Jon was meant to appear in at least one additional scene in Return of the Jedi, which did not make the final cut. The last two out of six images from the previous link are from the beginning of an extended version of the Emperor's arrival aboard the second Death Star from a scene later in the movie, and the penultimate image shows Jon as part of a group of officers standing in a docking bay to greet Palpatine.\nOriginal footage depicting Vader's arrival aboard the Death Star in the opening scene of Return of the Jedi was reused for the 1997 Special Edition release of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back to show Vader arriving aboard his flagship, the Executor, following his Cloud City duel with Luke Skywalker. As such, the extras who portrayed the Imperial personnel awaiting Vader's Death Star arrival in Return of the Jedi, including Jon's actor, can be seen in The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition. However, the Davod Jon character is not canonically established to have been aboard the Executor in the reused scene.",
