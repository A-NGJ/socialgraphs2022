 "content": "Dretcher was a male Anomid identity forger living during the Galactic War. In 3643 BBY he provided an identical body double for Devaronian con artist Tyresius Lokai, allowing him to fake his death and begin a new life under the name \"Gault Rennow\". Gault later claimed that Dretcher was trying to blackmail him and swindled several prominent residents of Nar Shaddaa in Dretcher's name, which resulted in a bounty on his head. Dretcher was able to hide in a cortosis-layered shipping container with life support for years, but every time he tried to leave under a new identity, Gault would compromise it. Finally, in 3630 BBY Gault arranged Dretcher's hiding place to be shipped to a gas giant Vandin, where he was planning his next heist, which required Dretcher's assistance. Though Dretcher tried to kill Gault and his companion with the battle droids, they were destroyed and he had no choice but to accept the job in exchange for finally getting Tyresius off his back.\nThe target of the heist was the Gilded Star, the massive treasury ship of the Eternal Empire which was hiding in deep atmosphere of the gas giant. Dretcher's part included forging the identity of High Justice Vaylin for her mother Senya Tirall, who provided a genetic match and required character knowledge. Dretcher's holographic disguise worked, allowing the team to get aboard the Gilded Star and plant a missile warhead inside the vault, which vaporized its entire content of precious metals, which was then pumped into a tanker, before making their getaway. After the job, Dretcher's cut was personally paid by Gault's partner Hylo Visz, though he still held grievances for Gault for the damages he inflicted and promised to send bounty hunters after him.\nDretcher appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 13: Profit and Plunder.",
