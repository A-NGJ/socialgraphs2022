 "content": "Nell Indigo was a female Wroonian mercenary who frequented the Outer Rim Territories. Her parents were gun-runners, an occupation that allowed her to develop skills that would aid her life as a mercenary.\nWhen she was twenty, Indigo was successful enough to buy her way into the Guild of Glorious Mercenaries. Since then, she made a name for herself as a hired-gun in the Outer Rim, working for anyone that would pay her.",
