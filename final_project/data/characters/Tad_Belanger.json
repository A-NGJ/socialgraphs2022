 "content": "Tad Belanger was a male Human volunteer of the Republic Medical Corps. During the Conquest of Makeb, the Protectors evacuation camps was attacked by former mercenaries of InterStellar Regulators to capture hostages and use them to negotiate for seats aboard the Ark. Tad was asked by Bryn Samsin to exact revenge on said mercenaries and rescue the hostages. Tad refused as the primary goal of his organization was humanitarian actions, but was lucky enough to have the Republic strike force in the area during the argument.",
