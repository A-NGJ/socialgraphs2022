 "content": "Vontaige, a male Human native of the planet Koros Major, was a top advisor to the ruler of the Koros system, Empress Teta, and a general in the Koros military. In 5000 BBY, faced by a surprise invasion of the Galactic Republic by Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow's Sith Empire, Vontaige attended a meeting with Teta and several others regarding the conflict which would come to be known as the Great Hyperspace War. After this meeting, Vontaige commanded the Koros army against the Sith in a battle at Koros Major and helped lead Koros to victory.\nVontaige was a male Human native to the planet Koros Major in the Koros system. He served as one of the top advisors to Empress Teta, the ruler of the seven unified worlds of the Koros system, and was an important general in Teta's military. Vontaige served under Teta in the Unification Wars of the Koros system, fighting against rebels on the world of Kirrek. Teta was victorious in the Unification Wars, and Vontaige returned to his place at her side as one of her top advisors. In 5000 BBY, the Sith Empire, led by Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow, launched the Great Hyperspace War, a surprise invasion of the Galactic Republic. Although Empress Teta had already been forewarned, the size of the Sith invasion force seemed to be overwhelming.\nAfter the Great Hyperspace War's first outbreak on Coruscant, Vontaige attended a meeting with Teta; Jedi Knight Odan-Urr; hyperspace explorer Jori Daragon, who first warned of the Sith threat; Llaban, former leader of the Kirrek rebel forces; and several other advisors. During the meeting, Vontaige expressed concern that the Koros military didn't have enough firepower to defend their worlds. He also admonished Llaban, telling him that he and his rebels had dealt enough damage. However, Teta forced Vontaige to allow Llaban to speak, and Llaban offered to bolster Teta's military with the addition of his rebel army from Kirrek. Teta accepted and dispatched Llaban to command his forces on Kirrek, while Vontaige stayed back on Koros Major to defend the capital of Cinnagar.\nVontaige commanded the Koros forces in the resultant battle from atop the city walls of Cinnagar and found himself in a tough situation. He was facing a numerically-superior Sith force, and many of the Tetan warships were damaged or destroyed in the Unification Wars. Still, Vontaige told his soldiers to stay vigilant, while observing the Sith approach with binoculars. In the end, however, Vontaige and the Koros forces prevailed at Koros Major, and the Republic eventually won the Great Hyperspace War.\nAs one of Teta's top advisors and a respected general in Teta's military, Vontaige was fiercely loyal to the Empress. Due to the Unification Wars, Vontaige held great disdain for Llaban, who led the resistance to Teta's rule on Kirrek, and believed that he should not be allowed to participate in the war with the Sith. Although Vontaige was worried about the size of the Sith fleet compared to the reduced strength of Koros' navy, Vontaige still led the Koros army against the Sith on Koros Major without reservation.\nVontaige made his first—and so far only—appearance in the third issue of Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire, a story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J. Anderson and released in 1996. In this appearance, Vontaige was illustrated by Dario Carrasco, Jr.",
