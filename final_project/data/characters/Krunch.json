 "content": "Krunch was a Wookiee who worked as chief mechanic for Bolabo Hujaan in Bolabo's Garage on Byblos. They met each other working together in a smuggler's starship, and Krunch accompanied Bolabo when he became emancipated. According to Bolabo, the name Krunch was chosen because that was the sound the Wookiee's clients made when they didn't pay for their repairs.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War Krunch rarely left the Garage, because he feared that Imperial forces would enslave him.\nThe Garage's clients were always satisfied because Krunch was a very skillful mechanic who was capable of doing wonderful things with almost every starship.",
