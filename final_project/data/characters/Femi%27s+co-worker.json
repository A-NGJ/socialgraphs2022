 "content": "A male Human individual lived during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, in the year 3653 BBY. He served onboard Orbital Security Station Six, a satellite monitoring the traffic in and out of the Galactic Republic capital of Coruscant, alongside Femi, a female Rutian Twi'lek, just prior to an attack by the Sith Empire He was killed in the first blast of the battle after after an Imperial Sith Lord named Angral ordered his flagship to fire on the station, starting the conflict.\nServing onboard Orbital Security Station Six over Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic government, this male individual who lived in the year 3653 BBY worked with Femi, a female Rutian Twi'lek, for Coruscant Security, monitoring the traffic in and out of the planet. Femi checked into Coruscant Control, reporting that there was nothing in her vicinity, and shared a brief conversation with the dispatcher. She then noticed Sith ships in her area and asked the flagship for clearance codes. The Sith and the Republic were meeting at Alderaan to discuss terms for ending the Great Galactic War, a galaxy-wide conflict that had been taking place between them for decades, and the unexpected arrival of their fleet caught the duo off-guard. Rather than transmit a response back to her, Angral, a Sith Lord from the Empire and leader of the assault, ordered his ship to fire on the satellite, killing Femi and her co-worker. This began the Sacking of Coruscant, a battle between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Coruscant, an agreement that forced the Republic to abandon long-time allies and give many outlying worlds over to the Sith and put an end to the Great Galactic War in favor of the Sith Empire.\nThis male was light-skinned with brown hair and worked aboard a satellite orbiting Coruscant for the Coruscant Security Force. His job was to monitor the traffic in and out of the planet with his co-worker, Femi.\nFemi and her co-worker wore a uniform with a black torso, white shoulder pads, and white sleeves. Their pants were also white. The headset that he wore on the job was a silver color.\nThis male was created for the first issue of the opening arc of Star Wars: The Old Republic, Threat of Peace, a webcomic serving as a prequel to Star Wars: The Old Republic, a Massively multiplayer online role-playing game being made by BioWare. He was not named in the comic and did not speak a word.",
