 "content": "Reni Wajetta, a slender, effeminate, sharp-dressed man with an easygoing manner hiding brutal ambition, made a career of blackmailing and bribing the rich and famous from the safety of his hometown. Ruthless in pressing the advantage, he became more rich and powerful than many of his victims. While he entertained the notion of relocating to a more pleasant environment, he was proscribed by the demands of his career.
