 "content": "Shagrad Loset was a Gotal who led the Gotal Foreign Affairs Commune on Antar 4 during a hostage standoff on Atzerri in 13:4. When the Roshu Sune, a militant splinter branch of the Gotal Assembly for Separation, hijacked a commuter hopper in the Atzerri spaceport of Skreeka, Loset and the Commune hoped to resolve the crisis independently of foreign aid and asked the peace-keeping Jedi Order not to interfere in a matter that should be handled by Gotals.\nA Jedi task force was dispatched to Atzerri by the Jedi Council anyway, and their ensuing confrontation with the Roshu Sune saw two Jedi, twelve hostages, and all of the guerrillas lose their lives. Loset later spoke to reporters from HoloNet News and criticized the Jedi Order for interfering in Gotal affairs and for the loss of life that occurred in the standoff, as he was confident that Commune could have resolved the standoff with minimal bloodshed.\nShagrad Loset appeared in Gotal Standoff Ends Violently, an article written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens and published in HoloNet News Vol. 531 53 on the HoloNet News website on April 25, 2002.",
