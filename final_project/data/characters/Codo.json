 "content": "Codo was human male who was a member of Saw Gerrera's rebel cell, the Partisans, during Jyn Erso's time in the cell before being abandoned by Saw in 5 BBY. Codo taught Jyn how to swim in the mudhole that the cell called a grotto and wouldn't talk to Jyn after being refused when trying to kiss her. After being brought back to Saw's base in the Catacombs of Cadera following the Battle on Jedha, Jyn asked a human female about Codo, to which the women responded by putting an imaginary blaster to her head and pulled the trigger.",
