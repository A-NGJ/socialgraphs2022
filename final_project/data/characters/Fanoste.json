 "content": "Fanoste was a Twi'lek male Sith Lord of the One Sith that posed as a diplomat. He commanded a One Sith army that was tasked with the mission of killing the rebellious Darth Wredd on Mala. During the ensuing battle, Wredd killed the Twi'lek.\nAs a leader among the One Sith Infiltrators Fanoste was presumably an intelligent and skilled commander, and a skilled enough spy to remain hidden and keep contact with his fellow infiltrators. His challenge to Wredd suggested he had confidence in his lightsaber skills, though they proved no match for the rogue Sith.",
