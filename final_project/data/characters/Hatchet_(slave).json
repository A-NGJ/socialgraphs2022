 "content": "Hatchet was a male Weequay who was a slave in an Imperial mining facility on the planet Sevarcos. Hatchet was caught in the middle of a battle between the Empire and the New Republic. At the urging of his fellow slaves, the Wookiee Greybok and the Quarren Palabar, Hatchet agreed to help turn the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor by releasing several imprisoned rancors. Later, Hatchet and his friends took part in the liberation of Kashyyyk.\nHatchet was a male Weequay who lived during the Age of the Empire. At some point prior to the Battle of Endor, he was enslaved by the Galactic Empire and sent to the spice mines of Sevarcos. The mine was run by the Empire and Zygerrian slavers. During his time there, he sustained a facial scar. In the months following the Battle of Endor, their spice mine on Sevarcos was the site of a battle between the Empire and the New Republic, the successor to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nWhen the Imperials appeared to gain the upper hand, Hatchet proposed to his fellow slaves, the Wookiee Greybok and the Quarren Palabar, that they use the battle as an opportunity to escape Sevarcos. The Wookiee and Quarren however suggested that they help the New Republic with Greybok ignoring Hatchet's protests and charging into the battle. During the battle, Greybok managed to free several rancors from a corral which rampaged through the Imperial lines and turned the tide of the battle in favor of the New Republic.\nAfter a Zygerrian slaver electrocuted the Wookiee using a needler, Hatchet bludgeoned the slaver to death with a rock. Once the battle was over, Hatchet asked a New Republic soldier what would happen to the three, to which the female soldier said they were free. After the soldier had moved away, Hatchet laughed that nobody knew what they would do now that they were free. He suggested that he and his friends explore the galaxy together as ex-slaves.\nFollowing their emancipation, Hatchet, Palabar, and Greybok became smugglers. After being recruited by the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, Hatchet and his companions traveled to the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk to help Han Solo and Chewbacca liberate the planet from the Empire. At the suggestion of Palabar, Hatchet, Greybok and Solo's team used pneumo-hammers to hammer eyebolts into the wood and to thread jump cables. This allowed Solo's team to take up position and shoot the deflector shield generator at Camp Sardo, the Imperial headquarters on Kashyyyk.\nWhen Hatchet panicked and began muttering that he did not want to be there, Greybok silenced him with a violent, one-armed shaking. After Solo's team had taken out the shield generator and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus had disabled the inhibitor chips controlling the Wookiee slaves, the Wookiees rose up in revolt enmasse. During the battle, Hatchet and his companions manned the guns on Jas Emari's gunship Halo and bombarded Imperial forces. Kashyyyk was subsequently liberated by the New Republic and Wookiees.\nHatchet was a male Weequay. He had a craggy face with a central scar running down between his eyes and nose to his lips and chin. During the Battle of Sevarcos, Hatchet proposed that he and his fellow slaves Greybok and Palabar take the opportunity to flee. However, Greybok and Palabar convinced him to help their New Republic liberators. During the fighting, he mustered enough courage to kill a Zygerrian slaver who was attacking Greybok. Hatchet was joyous after he and his companions were liberated by the New Republic and proposed exploring the galaxy. During a battle on Kashyyyk, Hatchet panicked and began muttering that he did not want to be there. Hatchet also knew how to operate guns.\nHatchet first appeared as a minor character in Chuck Wendig's 2015 novel Aftermath and its 2016 sequel Aftermath: Life Debt.",
