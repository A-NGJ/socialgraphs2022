 "content": "Vermilion was a Human male who was the leader of the Rebel Alliance cell on Toprawa. In order to avoid Imperial attention Vermilion took on several codenames, including Scarlett and Carmile. In order to allow Rebel sympathizers to recognize him however, Vermilion always wore a red article of clothing. He was also responsible for recruiting Havet Storm and was the architect of the Rebel attack on the Imperial Research Station on Toprawa. He was killed by Facet Anamor during the raid, while attempting to broadcast the Death Star Superlaser plans to the Rebel Alliance ship in orbit.",
