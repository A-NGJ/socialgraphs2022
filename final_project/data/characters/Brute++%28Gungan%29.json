 "content": "Brute was a Gungan male from Naboo. He chose to work as a shoe salesman, which, due to Gungans not wearing shoes, required him to leave his homeworld. Brute believed his vocation as a salesman was a noble and worthwhile endeavor, and one that brought him considerable satisfaction. It also earned him a large commission, and so in 31 BBY, he visited Depatar on Genarius—visiting the Grande Game casino—before continuing on to Tolea Biqua.",
