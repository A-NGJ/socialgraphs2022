 "content": "During the Imperial Era, a human female nurse served the Galactic Empire on board the Death Star under the supervision of a doctor. They both served the Sith Lord Darth Vader as his personal medical caretakers. The nurse became obsessed and psychotically in love with the Dark Lord of the Sith. After the doctor discovered that she stole Vader's cape and had a container of pieces of Vader's armor and vials of his blood, the doctor sought to report it immediately. The nurse, however, escaped and found herself in Vader's meditation chamber. After confessing her love to him and seeing his unmasked face, the unamused Vader killed her without a second thought by igniting his lightsaber through her chest and called the bridge to send someone to clean up the body, referring to her as garbage.\nThe nurse wore a boilersuit similar to an Imperial scientist technician's uniform, with an unidentified symbol on the left breast of her uniform. Underneath her boilersuit, she wore a blue shirt.",
