 "content": "A Falleen female child was captured by a group of Zygerrian slave traders in approximately 19 BBY. She, along with a human and a male Falleen adult, were kept by the slavers in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell City on the planet of Ord Mantell, overseen by the Zygerrian leader, Raney.\nIn around 19 BBY, a renegade clone squad took a bounty job to rescue a child named Muchi from the slaver's base in Old Ord Mantell City and at first, they erroneously thought the Falleen girl was Muchi. The clones successfully distracted the Zygerrians by releasing a caged rancor, allowing them to free the Falleen prisoners. However, when one squad member, Omega, addressed the girl as Muchi, the Falleen prisoner communicated that it was not her who was Muchi, but the rancor. Regardless, the clones freed and safely escorted both Falleen to a pair of speeder bikes at the south entrance of the city. There, the Falleen thanked their rescuers and then escaped the city with the child.",
