 "content": "Volo Madine was a Human male miner who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, the miner Volo Madine was present on the planet Dathomir to extract ore when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility nearby. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. Volo Madine was soon attacked by the zombies but was he rescued by his carrion spat Betsy. The creature charged the undeads, allowing her master to escape the undeads and run away. Madine assumed that Betsy was killed by the undeads and was devastated by the loss of his pet.\nLater, the Galactic Empire established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Volo Madine, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation. Madine eventually took shelter in Camp Beta, along with Stephon Sprocketfire and the Bothan Oona Wran.\nLater, a spacer arrived at Camp Beta and delivered a radio to Volo Madine. The radio was provided by the Imperial pilot Jeb Maris in Camp Alpha who had decided to establish communications between the camps. Once radios were delivered to the five camps in the Quarantine Zone, the survivors were able to safely coordinate high altitude supply drops sent from outside the Quarantine Zone. In the meantime, another spacer stumbled upon a alive and well Betsy while venturing in the Quarantine Zone. The adventurer decided to bring back the carrion spat to her owner and finally found Volo Madine in Camp Beta. The man was immensely pleased to figure out his pet survived and deeply grateful to the spacer.\nVolo Madine was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Volo Madine was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
