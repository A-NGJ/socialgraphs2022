He and Hanugar were shipwrecked when their vessel ran into one of Zelos II's many coral reefs, where he and Hanugar were forced to fight off melk and wait for co-conspirator K'zk. After finding the treasure, the ship crew left the Weequays for dead, only to have the Weequays swear that they would hunt them down.",
