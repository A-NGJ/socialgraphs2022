 "content": "A human Imperial officer served as a midshipman aboard the Executor, the flagship of Darth Vader, during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the midshipman was present aboard the Executor in the Jekara system as it was attacked by the Hutt Clan. During the battle, the midshipman got a sighting of a hostile, the bounty hunter Beilert Valance, on the vessels seventeenth level and informed Lieutenant Jyala Haydenn. Haydenn told the midshipman to vac the compartment, but the midshipman was hesistant to do so because an Imperial cadet was with the hostile.\nIn response, the lieutenant informed the midshipman that the cadet would be remebered for his service to the Galactic Empire, and that if the midshipman questioned their orders again, they would join the cadet through an air lock. The midshipman then vacced the compartment, though only the cadet was and sucked into space and killed. Valance, who was angered by the Empire's willingness to kill one of its own, destroyed a camera, and the midshipman informed Haydenn that its feed had been lost, though the lieutenant responded that they could see that. The midshipman then informed Haydenn of the identity of the hostile, and that there was a note on Valance's file that was classified above their rank. The new information interested Haydenn, who decided that Vader would want to know of the development.",
