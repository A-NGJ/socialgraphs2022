 "content": "Welrin Maduk was a male Duros who worked in the Cularin system during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Maduk operated the starship Fool's Paradise, which he used to carry cargoes throughout the Cularin system, and he sometimes carried out charter work for the Jedi Order. Circa 31 BBY, Maduk landed the Fool's Paradise in the city Hedrett on the planet Cularin, loading the craft with a cargo of technical equipment that he planned to transport to a research station on the planet Almas. However, Maduk was attacked in his ship's landing bay by a group of Believers led by the Dark Jedi duo Kosa-Yin Hadu and Gar Granga, who attempted to steal the Fool's Paradise. However, the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system, came to Maduk's rescue and defeated the Believers. The agents then escorted Maduk and the Fool's Paradise to Almas.",
