 "content": "Gwi was a Tarsunt male who was the leader of the Hidden Hand crime syndicate during the Imperial Era. He recruited a team to hunt down Darth Vader, claiming to be a humble messenger for the syndicate. After meeting Valance again, he revealed his true position, but was later captured in a skirmish with Vader.\nGwi was a Tarsunt male who led the the Hidden Hand crime syndicate during the Imperial Era. After Darth Vader interrogated and killed Hidden Hand members on Fikari, he spied on the Sith Lord as he contacted his master Darth Sidious, who stated that the syndicate was a high-priority target and must be eliminated. He later began assembling a team of bounty hunters tasked with hunting down Vader.\nWhile in BG-RT's Tavern and Spirits on Coruscant, Gwi followed the bounty hunter Beilert Valance to Docking Bay 21, where he greeted the cyborg as he entered his starship, the Broken Wing. Valance aimed his blaster pistol at the Tarsunt, but Gwi stated that he came to offer him a job and displayed his case of credits. He introduced himself as a messenger for the syndicate, hiding the truth that he was, in reality, their leader. Gwi reminded Valance that the Bounty Hunters' Guild had a bounty on his head due to the bounties he poached from them. He offered the cyborg a job to eliminate \"a man\" and clear the bounty, but Valance, however, refused and reminded him that he lived by two rules; always know who he worked for and operate as a bounty hunter alone. As Valance boarded his ship, Gwi stated that the target was Darth Vader, finally piquing his interest.\nGwi introduced Valance to the team he would be working with, explaining the stories behind the tracker Honnah, the sniper Urrr'k, the slicer Chio Fain, the jedi hunter Arr-Nine-Nineteen and the bounty hunter Dengar. Upon meeting the team, Valance destroyed Arr-Nine-Nineteen, much to Gwi's shock. Gwi explained that he was required for the mission, but the cyborg revealed that the droid was a mole for the Hutts and that he lied about his profession. Valance stated that bounty hunters only took jobs for money, to which Gwi replied he was correct. With the team fully assembled, they embarked on their mission to hunt down Vader.\nGwi later resided within the syndicate's main base. After Valance was captured and brought before him, the Tarsunt revealed that he always lead the syndicate from the beginning. As he proceeded to thrash and taunt the cyborg, he boasted about building the Hidden Hand over several years. Valance revealed that only he knew about his actual role, and that he deduced the location of the outpost as it was located in an asteroid field. Gwi continued to beat him, reminding him of his actions against the Bounty Guild. Valance stated in return that he tracked him down as revenge for the destruction of his homeworld Chorin.\nAs Gwi prepared to fire his blaster at him, Vader and his forces began raiding the hideout. Valance used the distraction to attack him, knocking the blaster out of his hands. He aimed the blaster at the Tarsunt, but the latter was suddenly lifted into the air by Vader, who told the cyborg that the Emperor needed him alive. Gwi was then dragged away by stormtroopers, where he was to be interrogated by the Emperor himself.\nGwi had brown hair and eyes with gray skin. He had a humble approach when meeting Valance and convinced the cyborg to join him without any threats, hiding his true position as the Hidden Hand's leader. When he revealed the fact to Valance, he boasted about how he built the Hidden Hand over many years and was furious when describing the failure of Valance's mission.\nAs Valance was brought before him, Gwi proceeded to beat him down repeatedly, but was quickly overpowered by the cyborg when the Empire attacked his hideout.\nGwi wore a brown coat with black pants and boots. While recruiting Valance, he carried a briefcase full of credits. He also carried a cane and used a blaster pistol while residing in the Hidden Hand's main hideout.",
