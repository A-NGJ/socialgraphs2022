 "content": "During the Clone Wars, a clone sergeant was based on the space station New Dawn, a Galactic Republic military installation that was located in the Druckenwell system. Circa 21 BBY, a group of freelance agents traveled to New Dawn at the behest of the station's commander, Jedi Knight Renij Jaa. The clone sergeant commanded a squad of clone troopers that were sent to greet the agents and the clones escorted them to a conference room, where Jaa met with the agents. Once Jaa had finished speaking to the agents, he signaled to the sergeant to lead them to their starship.",
