 "content": "Rashtah was a Wookiee slave trader and an associate and bodyguard of the crime lord Krayn. Involvement in such a 'profession' was, of course, unusual for a Wookiee.\nIn 29 BBY, Rashtah accompanied Krayn to Rorak 5 for a business meeting with the Colicoids, who sought total control over the spice operations on Nar Shaddaa. Krayn directed Rashtah to monitor the movements of the slave trader \"Bakleeda,\" an advisor to the Colicoids who was tasked with inspecting the crime lord's factories on the \"Smuggler's Moon.\"\nAfter an intense struggle, Rashtah was killed in a turbolift within the slave factories of Nar Shaddaa by \"Bakleeda\" , whom the Wookiee had attacked at the behest of Krayn.\nRashtah had a scar that ran from his head to his lip; a battle-damaged eye was covered by an eyepatch.\nAlthough Jedi Quest: Path to Truth depicts Rashtah with a scar running through his eye and wearing an eye patch, in the Jedi Quest comic series he is depicted with both eyes intact. Some images in the comics, however, do show his facial scar.",
