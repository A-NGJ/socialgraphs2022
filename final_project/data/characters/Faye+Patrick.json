 "content": "Faye Patrick was a female Zabrak criminal who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nFaye Patrick was an expert in Teräs Käsi from Coronet City. By the time following the Battle of Yavin, Faye Patrick was part of a group of Corellian slavers active in and around the city of Tyrena. The slavers were responsible for a 500% increase in the number of missing persons on Corellia in one month. Patrick usually seduced then drugged men before selling them to the slave ring. She also captured the Z'all family. At some point, she was suspected by the Corellian Security Force to be involved. Major Alana Walden was investigating the case, and pleaded with citizens to report Faye's location to CorSec.\nIn 1 ABY, the slave ring operations were discovered after a group of slaves led by Kyran Silene managed to escape the slaver bunker near Tyrena. Kyran contacted his friend Bandor Mokk but the Bothan was watched by Faye Patrick who threatened his life. Kyran's wife, Madison Silene, later recruited a spacer to investigate the disappearance of her husband. The spacer convinced Mokk to talk about Faye Patrick and the escaped slaves. The spacer eventually fought and killed Patrick in a street of Tyrena. After the death of Faye Patrick, the spacer met Kyran Silene and helped him to reveal the slaver operations to the CorSec.\nFaye Patrick appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Faye Patrick was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives,\" published on June 8, 2006.",
