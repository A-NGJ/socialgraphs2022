 "content": "Clarrisa was a Human female who lived during the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a companion of hers took her on a surprise vacation to Mustafar. However, when they arrived, Clarrisa was furious that he would have taken her to such an inhospitable world.\nClarrisa was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.\nWhen examined, her name only appeared as \"an unhappy tourist,\" however the conversation between her and companion revealed her name to be Clarrisa.",
