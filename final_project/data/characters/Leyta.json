 "content": "\"Deadeye\" Leyta was a female Selonian living on Corellia during the Galactic War. When a larger clan of Selonians oppresed her clan for years, treating them like slaves, Leyta decided to confront them. The meeting resulted in a shoot-out, at the end of which Leyta was the only one still standing, earning her the \"Deadeye\" nickname. Her clan decided that for her own safety, it would be better for her to leave the planet and Leyta eventually ended up doing mercenary work on Tatooine. She saw the Tatooine Star Fortress of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul as her biggest target and when the Commander of the Alliance arrived to take out the Star Fortress shield bunker, Leyta offered her assistance. She arranged for a ground force to assemble and assisted the commander in assaulting and destroying the shield bunker. She then traveled to Odessen, where she formally joined the Alliance after the Star Fortress was destroyed.\n\"Deadeye\" Leyta appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as a new companion for all classes, recruited through the Star Fortress series of missions.",
