 "content": "A male Human individual served as an Imperial data officer during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, the data officer was an Imperial officer stationed in the Science Outpost on Dathomir.\nIn 1 ABY, during the Empire Day festivities, he met an Imperial spacer, sent to meet him from Rori by an Imperial garrison historian. The data officer had the Imperial meet up with an Imperial commander on Yavin 4 so that he could complete his mission concerning an imprisoned Jedi.\nThe Imperial data officer was very loyal to the Empire and its Emperor. He, like Palpatine, believed that the Jedi were what sickened the Old Republic. The data officer admired Palpatine's courage in declaring the Jedi as outlaws. It was for this reason that he joined the Empire.\nAn Imperial data officer, who lacked an official name, appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Imperial data officer was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. During the 2005 Empire Day live event from June 29 to July 11, 2005, he could be found in the Science Outpost and was part of a quest titled \"Happy Empire Day!,\" which sent players on an important mission throughout the galaxy. After the live event ended, the Imperial data officer never reappeared in the game since the Empire Day event was discontinued until its complete overhaul in 2008.",
