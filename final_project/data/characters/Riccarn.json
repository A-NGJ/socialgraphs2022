 "content": "Riccarn was a human stormtrooper who served in the Sith Lord Darth Vader's personal legion, the 501st Legion. As part of a fireteam alongside fellow stormtroopers Ella, Tig, Xander and Deena Lorn, Riccarn made it through many missions with their the other troopers, and they were assigned with a squad aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor.\nRiccarn spent some nights in a corner of the Super Star Destroyer's mess with their squadmates, aside from trooper FS-451, notably sipping alcohol illegally distilled by Xander and wondering why 451 was still only a stormtrooper. Riccarn claimed that 451 had wanted to become an incinerator trooper, contrary to Tig's belief that the stormtrooper wished to become a death trooper. In 3 ABY, Riccarn, Ella and Xander remained aboard the Executor, when it traveled to the tibanna mining colony Cloud City, while Lorn, Tig and FS-451 were sent down to the city with Vader.\nRiccarn was mentioned in the short story \"The Witness,\" which was written by Adam Christopher and released as part of the 2020 short story collection From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back.",
