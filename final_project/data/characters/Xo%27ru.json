 "content": "Xo'ru was a Kel Dor male bounty hunter who worked with Kindin during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Xo'ru and another hunter named Kindin traveled to Ord Mantell to capture and bring back the Smuggler who would later be known as the Voidhound, as the crime lord Rogun the Butcher had placed a bounty on the smuggler's head for losing a shipment of blasters that belonged to him.\nWhen the smuggler arrived at the docking bay in Fort Garnik, he was confronted by Xo'ru and Kindin who too had just arrived. Unwilling to convince him to come with them, the two along with the smuggler and Corso Riggs got into a fight in which both Xo'ru and Kindin were killed.",
