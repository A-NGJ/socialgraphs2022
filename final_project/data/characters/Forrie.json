 "content": "Forrie was a male Human thief on the planet Coruscant.\nIn 19 BBY, Forrie, along with his companions Kimm and an unnamed Bothan, were trying to steal freighters on a freighter park located on Quadrant G-80. Forrie and Kimm boarded the freighter Cornucopia in an attempt to steal it, not knowing that six Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos were aboard along with an Imperial Commando and the freighter's pilot. Both Forrie and Kimm were instantly killed by the commando Niner and Null ARC Ordo Skirata.",
