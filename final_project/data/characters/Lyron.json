 "content": "Lyron was a male Duros Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He chose the fellow Duros Teo Gronn as his Padawan and in 22 BBY, Lyron was part of a strike team sent to the planet Geonosis to rescue Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was about to be executed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Lyron perished in the resulting battle, leaving Gronn without a master.\nA Force-sensitive male Duros, Lyron attained the rank of Jedi Master in the Jedi Order sometime during the reign of the Galactic Republic. At some point in his life, Lyron selected fellow Duros Teo Gronn as his Padawan learner. In 22 BBY, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured by forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems while on a scouting mission on the planet Geonosis. Jedi Council member Mace Windu quickly assembled a strike team to rescue Kenobi, who was scheduled to be executed.\nLyron was part of the strike team and perished when the rescue mission became a bloody battle that sparked the inter-galactic Clone Wars. Fellow Jedi Master Oshi-Jid became the new master of Gronn, but was presumed to be killed only four months after the start of the war in the Battle of Muunilinst.\nLyron was first mentioned in Only the Force, a stand-alone adventure written by J.D. Wiker and released by the RPGA on behalf of Wizards of the Coast in 2004.",
