 "content": "Re'Nicu was a Cerean male who was a member of the Cell, a group trying to oust Nirama from control of the Cularin system's crime in 31 BBY.\nThis was a name on a list of Cell members that the Gamemaster could assign whatever role and skills necessary to challenge the players when the Cell tested the skills they claimed they were good at. This character's skill would depend on the player character's and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Re'Nicu would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by The Cell because the PC could filter Re'Nicu's name as a Cell member.",
