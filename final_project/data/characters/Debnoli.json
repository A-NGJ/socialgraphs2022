 "content": "Debnoli was a marksman who frequented Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley. He sought revenge on the Galactic Empire for impounding his ship. From time to time, Debnoli worked with Bron Burs, a former commando from the planet Nentan.\nIn 0 BBY, the smuggler Gela Yeens, who also worked for Jabba Desilijic Tiure as a debt collector, was searching for him. Debnoli was present in the Mos Eisley cantina when Greedo was killed by Han Solo.\nDebnoli first appeared as an uncredited Cantina patron in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. According to Tom Spina, he was portrayed in the film by an uncredited George Oliver. According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, Debnoli was named as an anagram of actor Clint Eastwood's character \"Blondie\" from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.",
