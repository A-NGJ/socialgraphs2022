 "content": "Eyar Marath was a female Sullustan singer and dancer who, at the height of her popularity during the Clone Wars, traveled the galaxy with a troupe of entertainers led by Epoh Trebor, providing entertainment for Republic troops and personnel stationed on various battlefields. At the time of her performance on the planet of Drongar, one of her songs had made it onto the acclaimed Galactic Top 40,000 list. While on Drongar, she engaged in a brief romance with Sullustan reporter Den Dhur and even went so far as to propose that Dhur become the patriarch of her warren-clan back on Sullust.\nEyar Marath's name is an anagram of Martha Raye, a singer and comedienne who performed in numerous USO shows with Bob Hope.",
