 "content": "Rik-tak was a cab driver and a Justice Action Network operative who operated in the Tapani sector during the Galactic Civil War. He overheard a lot of information from his passengers that was of interest to the JAN. Rik-tak was a colleague and pen pal of the Rodian Kelsek, who operated in the suburbs of Mrlsst Trade and Science Academy to recruit more JAN operatives.\nRik-tak had rust-brown fur and, like all of this species, had a whip-like tail, clawed hands and an elongated snout with large incisors. He wore a oversized brown cloak with a tight hood and a belt with numerous pockets and pouches. Although his etiquette was not great he was generally regarded as friendly.",
