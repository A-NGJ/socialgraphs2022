 "content": "Aarton Chireen was a human male lieutenant in the Resistance from Jaymir, where he and his sister Nimi Chireen were recruited by pilot Ello Asty. The siblings were held in reserve until after the Battle of Crait, when they joined the core Resistance group.\nIn 35 ABY, he was stationed at the Resistance base on the moon Ajan Kloss as a quartermaster. When the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon returned to the base from a mission on fire, Chireen ordered fire crews to attend to the flames. He then attended a meeting in which it was revealed that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious had returned and that a Sith fleet was going to reinforce the First Order from the planet Exegol.\nAarton Chireen was a human male from Jaymir who served in alongside his sister Nimi Chireen in the Resistance during its war against the First Order. After their initial recruitment by the pilot Ello Asty, the siblings were held in reserve by the Resistance and Aarton was asked to gather intelligence about his local area of operation. This changed following the Hosnian Cataclysm and Battle of Starkiller Base in 34 ABY, after which Aarton and Nimi were called up for active duty and increased their involvement in the movement, joining the core group following the Battle of Crait.\nBy 35 ABY, Aarton held the rank of lieutenant and was part of the command staff for the Resistance's base on the jungle moon Ajan Kloss. Working as the base's quartermaster, he was responsible for allocating resources to the pilots, soldiers and technicians stationed there. When the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon returned to the base ablaze with fire from an intelligence mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony, Chireen rushed toward it with other personnel and ordered fire crews to front and rear of the damaged vehicle.\nChireen later attended a meeting of the base personnel to discuss the intelligence that the mission to the colony had recovered. Chireen stood behind the adviser Maz Kanata as Commander Poe Dameron revealed that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious had returned and that the First Order would soon be reinforced with a Sith fleet from the planet Exegol.\nAarton Chireen had tan skin, brown eyes and black hair.\nOn Ajan Kloss, Aarton Chireen wore a khaki shirt with a brown belt, pants and gloves. He had a gray scarf knotted around his neck and used a brown cap with a pair of black goggles.\nAarton Chireen first appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. He was played by British actor Aaron Neil, who was credited as \"Resistance Officer\" and had his first name incorporated into the character's.",
