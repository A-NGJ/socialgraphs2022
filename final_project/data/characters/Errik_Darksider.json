 "content": "Errik Darksider was a member of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Errik Darksider resided in the city of Mos Eisley on Tatooine. While here, he encountered a spacer who he surmised would make a suitable candidate for Jabba's forces. Errik told the spacer that he knew the whereabouts of certain locations on Tatooine, including the Hutt Hideout outside of Mos Eisley. For several credits, Errik agreed to betray Jabba and tell the spacer of Hutt Hideout's location. He also agreed to give the whereabouts of two other locations for additional credits, including a destroyed Rebel Military Base and a bunker overrun by Tusken Raiders.\nErrik Darksider was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Errik Darksider was added to the game with the \"Publish 5\" update, released on December 16, 2003.\nPlayers who talk to him could receive the waypoints to three locations on Tatooine, including the Hutt Hideout, a Tusken Bunker, and a destroyed Rebel Military Base. For Errik to give the player the waypoints, the player must agree to pay varying amounts of credits for each location.",
