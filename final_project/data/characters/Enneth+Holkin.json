 "content": "Enneth Holkin was a Human male from the planet of Corellia.\nHis criminal record consisted of stealing a speeder bike for a joyride when he was a teenager on Corellia. Later, he would become aide to Co-Chief of State of Corellia Denjax Teppler in 43.5 ABY. Holkin was on his way to the Senate Building when Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who was suffering from a psychotic breakdown, suddenly ambushed him and knocked him out, taking his clothes so he could get into Level 2 of the Senate Building; an area which Horn was not authorized to access, but Holkin was.",
