 "content": "Bochaba was a male Hutt crime lord on the planet Sleheyron around the time of the Jedi Civil War. He gained notoriety when he took possession of an HK-series assassin droid with the designation HK-47. Bochaba installed several programs to improve the performance of the droid and used its assassination protocols to kill three hundred twenty-two sentient beings, the Hutt's competitors, in a single year. These successful eliminations made Bochaba very wealthy.\nHowever, the Exchange crime syndicate opposed Bochaba and had the Hutt killed in a grizzly fashion in retaliation. As HK-47 would later explain to one of his later owners, the residents of the sector were \"fishing pieces of Bochaba out of their soup for weeks afterward.\" Upon discovering his master's death, HK-47 shut down and a rival Hutt claimed him as his own, later selling the droid to a Senator.\nBochaba was introduced in the 2003 video game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, as part of HK-47's backstory, which can be discovered by the player through conversations with HK-47.",
