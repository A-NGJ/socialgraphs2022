 "content": "This Mandallian Giant assassin was a criminal living on Nar Shaddaa in 31 BBY. He pretended to be a Jedi to fool Quinlan Vos whom he intended to kill. Vos, with the aid of Vilmarh Grahrk, saw through his disguise and killed him with a blaster.\nThe Mandallian Giant assassin was one of many beings on Nar Shaddaa who in 31 BBY placed bets on how long the Jedi Quinlan Vos would survive after his memory was wiped with an overdose of glitteryll. To try to make sure he and his Gotal partner won the bet, he acquired Quinlan Vos's lightsaber and a set of robes similar to a Jedi's. They used these to pretended to be Jedi to fool Vos into trusting them so that they could more easily kill him at the time they had bet on his death taking place. However the criminal Vilmarh Grahrk recognized the pair and told Vos they were merely other gamblers attempting to cheat. This angered the pair and they attacked Vos and Grahrk. The Mandallin Giant charged first but was shot in the shoulder by Vos and killed. Vos then used the Force to retrieve his lightsaber from the fallen criminal.",
