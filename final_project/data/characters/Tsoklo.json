 "content": "Tsoklo was a Rodian male who resided on the planet Lothal several years prior to the Galactic Civil War. Tsoklo served as factory worker, but also worked for the Galactic Empire as an informant who reported to Supply Master Yogar Lyste. In exchange for protection, Tsoklo would report to Lyste on the activities of unproductive workers and law breakers. The Rodian also operated a fruit stall in the city of Kothal, and at one point sold his supply of imported meiloorun fruit to Lyste.\nDuring the Empire Day holiday, the Imperials set out to find a Rodian named Tseebo, an Imperial Information Office worker who deserted the Empire after stealing a large number of Imperial files. Tsoklo was apprehended twice by Imperials—first by a trio of TIE fighter pilots and later by Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau—who compared Tsoklo to a picture of Tseebo to verify whether or not Tsoklo was the Rodian the Empire was after. On both cases the Imperials realized that Tsoklo was not their Rodian. Tsoklo later visited Old Jho's Pit Stop for a game of sabacc, where he lost to the human Lando Calrissian and the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios.\nLater during the Siege of Lothal, Tsoklo was imprisoned and enslaved on a Mining Guild ore crawler that was stripping the planet of its natural resources. Overseen by the Trandoshan foreman Proach, Tsoklo and several others worked in the murky conditions of the crawler until they were saved by the Spectres rebel group when they hijacked the crawler in the name of the Rebellion, after which Tsoklo himself pledged to fight the Empire.\nA Rodian male from the planet Lothal, Tsoklo was a factory worker under the employ of the Galactic Empire during the year 3272 LY. In addition, he served the Empire as an informant, reporting to Supply Master Yogar Lyste on the activities of unproductive workers or rule-breaking citizens. Despite this, he openly endorsed the explosive destruction of a TIE/ln space superiority starfighter at the hands of the Mandalorian Sabine Wren, a member of the rebel Spectres group, which occurred after Tsoklo observed a Stormtrooper commander roughly remove another Lothal citizen from a restricted area in Capital City. Tsoklo later bumped into one of Wren's comrades, the Lasat Honor Guardsman Garazeb Orrelios, shortly before Orrelios destroyed a TIE fighter of his own. Later yet, Tsoklo was nearly ran over by the Lothal street urchin Ezra Bridger, who was piloting a stolen 614-AvA speeder bike while on the run from Orrelios and Jedi-in-exile Kanan Jarrus. Tsoklo was later present in the shanty-town referred to as \"Tarkintown\" when Jarrus' rebels delivered fruit to the hungry populace.\nTsoklo eventually boarded a Star Commuter 2000 shuttle that headed to the nearby planet Garel, and he later returned to Lothal. In addition to working as a factory worker, Tsoklo ran a fruit stall in the Lothal city of Kothal, where he sold imported meiloorun fruit. At some point, his entire supply of meiloorun fruit was bought by the Empire, and loaded onto an Imperial Troop Transport under the command of Supply Master Lyste.\nWhile Lyste's stormtroopers loaded the fruits, Bridger and Orrelios, who were looking to buy some meilooruns, stumbled into an unloaded crate. They inquired about the fruit's price, but Tsoklo informed them that the fruit had already been sold. Bridger suggested buying the fruit from the first buyer, but Tsoklo pointed out that the fruit was in the Empire's possession. He bid them luck anyways. After stealing a TIE fighter, the pair of rebels eventually stole one of the fruits from an ITT.\nDuring the celebrations of the Galactic Empire's fifteenth anniversary, the Imperial forces were on full alert, searching for a Rodian named Tseebo. Tseebo was an Imperial Information Office worker who had deserted after downloading numerous Imperial files onto his AJ^6 cyborg construct. Sometime before the Empire Day parade, Tsoklo had gone to a Lothal outpost known as Jhothal, and visited Old Jho's Pit Stop, a bar and eatery that was run by the Ithorian bartender Old Jho. Also visiting were Jarrus and the other rebels Tsoklo had encountered, who were looking for work and information on the heightened Imperial presence. Meanwhile, a trio of TIE fighter pilots entered the establishment and promptly apprehended Tsoklo while the Rodian was enjoying a cup of spicebrew.\nOne pilot compared Tsoklo to a portrait of Tseebo, and once satisfied that Tsoklo was not their target, the pilots released the frightened Rodian before they harassed Old Jho, who had refused to air an Imperial broadcast in his cantina. Jho eventually complied, and one TIE pilot ordered Tsoklo and the other patrons to raise a toast to Emperor Sheev Palpatine, while holding them at gunpoint. The broadcast, however, was almost immediately hacked by the supposed senator-in-exile Gall Trayvis, who delivered a message of hope to other rebels. Tsoklo and the others watched the broadcast as the pilots angrily told Jho to turn it off.\nTsoklo later returned to Capital City to watch the Empire Day parade, which was showcasing a new kind of TIE fighter. While watching the parade, which consisted of various stormtrooper platoons and AT-DP walkers, Tsoklo was apprehended again by Imperials, this time the Imperial Security Bureau agent Kallus and several stormtroopers. Like the TIE pilots, Kallus compared Tsoklo to a picture of Tseebo. Kallus realized the Rodians were not the same, however, and reminded Tsoklo to enjoy the festivities. Although shaken, Tsoklo cheered when Wren and Orrelios launched fireworks into the nighttime sky, which appeared to be a part of the celebrations. Moments later, the rebels struck and destroyed the new TIE fighter, sending the citizens of Capital City scattering for cover.\nSometime later, Tsoklo returned to Old Jho's Pit Stop where he participated in a game of sabacc, a kind of card game. The game's other two participants were Orrelios and the human smuggler Lando Calrissian. As the game progressed, Calrissian ended up controlling the game, and Tsoklo found himself out of money to bet, forcing him to fold his last hand and leave the table in a fit of anger. Through the use of an Idiot's Array hand of cards, Calrissian ultimately won the card game.\nTsoklo later witnessed Orrelios' comrades evade Imperial patrols on speeder bikes, and witnessed Orrelios himself hijack an AT-DP walker alongside Bridger.\nDue to the continued escapades of Orrelios and his rebel friends, the Empire eventually launched a full planetary blockade of Lothal. The citizens were subjected to curfews, courtesy of Minister Maketh Tua, and Tarkintown was burned to the ground. Tsoklo was walking the streets of Capitol City when the Rebels, who had previously left Lothal, returned to the planet when they attempted to rescue Tua, who decided to defect from the Empire. The rescue attempt failed, and the Rebels' speeder was shot down and landed in the streets, nearly crushing Tsoklo and several other citizens. Tsoklo, mouth agape, watched as the Rebels evacuated their damaged craft and ran into the city's alleys.\nSometime later, Tsoklo visited the planet Nixus, and was present at Nixus Hub 218 when Bridger and the pirate Hondo Ohnaka tried to conduct business with the kingpin Azmorigan. Tsoklo walked alongside and conversed with an Ugnaught while at the hub.\nTsoklo later returned to Lothal by the year 1 BBY, right as the Empire tightened its grip on the planet. Alongside several others, Tsoklo was eventually imprisoned by the Empire for helping rebels, and was forced into slavery under the Mining Guild, who was in charge of strip-mining Lothal of its resources. Tsoklo was assigned to ore crawler 413-24 and placed under the command of Captain Seevor and his foreman Proach.\nWhile working on the crawler, fellow slave and former crime lord Cikatro Vizago told his co-slaves about how he was imprisoned for helping the rebel Spectres cell. Despite his imprisonment, Vizago believed that his rebel friends would come back for him. As it happened, the Spectres rebel cell and the local Lothal resistance group discovered the ore crawler in Lothal's southern hemisphere and quickly developed plans to hijack the vehicle, albeit while unaware of Vizago's presence on the crawler.\nThe slaves were eventually found by Spectres member and Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus after he infiltrated the crawler's boiler room. Initially believing Jarrus to be with the Mining Guild, Tsoklo and the other slaves took cover when Jarrus drew his blaster pistol. When Jarrus revealed his true intentions, the slaves cautiously revealed themselves to the Jedi. Vizago thanked Jarrus for what he believed was a rescue effort moments before he was attacked by Proach. Orrelios joined the skirmish, and the fight eventually led outside of the boiler room. Tsoklo and the others followed the battle and cheered when Orrelios defeated Proach after a heated brawl.\nHowever, an Imperial patrol intercepted the crawler, forcing Vizago and Orrelios to act as captain and foreman, respectively. In order to keep up appearances, Orrelios had Tsoklo and the others return to work. Eventually the patrol left, having believed Vizago to be the crawler captain, and Seevor was killed during an altercation with Ezra Bridger a little while later. Along with the other freed slaves, Tsoklo pledged his support of the Rebel Alliance, officially joining the fight against the Empire.\nAlthough he worked for the Empire, Tsoklo nonetheless congratulated Sabine Wren, by holding his hands together and bowing repeatedly, for attacking an Imperial air base and blowing up a TIE fighter. In addition, he was harassed by Imperial authorities during their hunt for Tseebo, which left him visibly shaken after each encounter. However, after his confrontation with Kallus, his mood was lifted after a series of fireworks lit up the Imperial parade on Empire Day, which also caused him to smile and applaud.\nAfter losing a game of Sabacc to Calrissian and Orrelios, Tsoklo was visibly distraught, and after throwing his cards onto the table, he stormed off. When Bridger and Orrelios realized they would have to obtain a meiloorun fruit from the Empire, Tsoklo laughed at the possibility of them simply buying one of the fruits, but he wished them luck anyways.\nTsoklo was a braggart and a bully, and tended to harass others with the fact he had an Imperial friend. However, Tsoklo's relationship with Supply Master Lyste was merely a mean of protecting himself. If cornered by his Imperial allies, however, Tsoklo's belligerent nature would falter, giving in to cowardly throwing himself at his superior's mercy. He could also resort to a panicked flail.\nTsoklo's fear also peaked while enslaved by the Mining Guild. Upon believing the Jedi Jarrus to be a Mining Guild agent, Tsoklo cowered behind equipment in Crawler 413-24's boiler room and armed himself with a tool. However, after witnessing the Rebel's heroic actions during the following hour, Tsoklo bravely pledged to fight against the Empire.\nA Rodian with green pebble-textured skin, Tsoklo had black eyes, stood at 1.79 meters, and weighed 72 kilograms. Unlike some Rodians, Tsoklo did not exhibit spines on the top of his head.\nTsoklo kept a utility vibroblade for personal defense. Generally, Tsoklo wore a blue jacket, light pants, and brown boots during his daily activities, such as when he went to Garel, moved about Capital City, or operated his fruit stall in Kothal. Tsoklo also had a house.\nAfter being enslaved by the Mining Guild, Tsoklo was fitted with a vest in the guild's blue and yellow color scheme. He had access to his ore crawler's tools, one of which he prepared to use as a defensive weapon.\nTsoklo was created for the Star Wars Rebels television show, which first aired in 2014 with the premiere of Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion. His first appearance was in a promotional short titled \"Art Attack.\" In Fighter Flight he was credited as Vendor #1, and his voice was provided by David Shaughnessy. Tsoklo later made another voiced appearance in \"Crawler Commandeers,\" where his voice was provided by Dave Filoni while credited as \"Slave #2.\"\nHe was identified by name in the book Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head, authored by Pablo Hidalgo.\nHead to Head also offered a \"What if?\" match-up between Tsoklo and Supply Master Lyste. In the encounter, Tsoklo's constant bullying of his neighbors caused them to report to Lyste on their own, telling him that Tsoklo had been hoarding grain, which Tsoklo planned to sell on a black market. Lyste orders a surprise inspection of Tsoklo's home, discovers the grain, and then proceeds to arrest the Rodian. Although Tsoklo draws a utility vibroblade, he ultimately surrenders and pleads for mercy, only to find that the Empire does not have any. The book ranks Tsoklo high in agility, but low in courage. The match-ups presented in this book are purely theoretical.",
