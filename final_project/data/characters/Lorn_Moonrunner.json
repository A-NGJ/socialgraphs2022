 "content": "Lorn Moonrunner, born as Corvus Langlier, was the original owner of the astromech droid R2-4B. When he was younger, he dreamed of becoming an Imperial soldier and eventually attended the Raithal Army Academy on a scholarship. As he was promoted, however, he saw more and more of the cruel actions of the Empire. As a computer programmer, he designed a program which could remote control TIE bombers and TIE fighters, but when he discovered that his program was going to be used to attack planets resistant to Imperial rule, he defected. He had a wife called Artis and a son called Denel, and they settled on Rhamalai with his family.",
