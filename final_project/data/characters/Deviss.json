 "content": "\"Deviss\" was the nickname of a Clone Commander and Advanced Recon Commando who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. His equipment included red outlined Phase II clone trooper armor, a pauldron, a kama, macrobinoculars, a DC-15A blaster rifle, and two DC-17 blaster pistols. Deviss was created on the planet of Kamino. As a clone trooper based on the genetic template of the human male bounty hunter Jango Fett, he was 1.83 meters tall and had tan skin. Deviss received training through the ARC program to prepare him for special missions.\nDeviss was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in the 2015 reference book Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Deviss was first mentioned in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary, a guide book published in 2005 and written by James Luceno, where he was first pictured, albeit unnamed. He received the designation \"CT-65/91-6210\" in Guide to the Grand Army of the Republic, a reference article published in Star Wars Insider 84.\nDeviss is based on Clone Commander Bly's old color design, which was changed to better match the Felucian environment from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. While the red clone commander does not appear in the movie, he was used as the basis of the \"clone commander\" figure for the film's toy line. The figure would eventually be repainted green in a later wave.",
