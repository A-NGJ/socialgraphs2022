 "content": "\"Tails\" was the nickname of a TIE fighter pilot in the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing during the Galactic Civil War. Several weeks after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Tails was among thirty-two TIE fighter pilots, making up two squadrons, which were deployed aboard the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Aerie under the leadership of Lieutenant Preartes to hunt the New Republic EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Hellion's Dare, which was escorted by two of its own squadrons.\nThe Aerie and its complement drove the Dare and its escorts out of the Jiruus system and chased New Republic vessels through the Oridol Cluster, tracking them by picking off a starfighter when it received jump coordinates before escaping into hyperspace. The New Republic pilots thought of Tails' nickname due to the ion trails left by the TIE pilot's fighter. Tails also displayed a habit for making sharp turns and having wild firing patterns. Taking some losses along the way, the Aerie's squadrons were able to destroy the Hellion's Dare and all but two of its escort fighters.\n\"Tails\" appeared in a starfighter in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, the initial installment of the Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron trilogy which was written by Alexander Freed.",
