 "content": "Garthus Hal was a Human explosives expert and bomber for hire.\nHis early life included stints as a soldier, a pirate, and a gambler, but he soon became recognized for his skill in demolitions. With his reputation established, he went into business along with a small band of \"lads,\" as he called them, as freelance bombers. Garthus had no scruples and hired himself out equally to the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance, or to various terrorist factions, whoever could afford his services. He became infamous working for Moff Jander Graffe, who hired him to commit terrorist acts on the planet Esseles in the name of the Rebellion, including one bombing at the Togatto Speedway that killed many popular racers.",
