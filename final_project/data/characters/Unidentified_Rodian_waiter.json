 "content": "A Rodian worked as a waiter at the Convors Perch Restaurant in the Wealthy District of the planet Milvayne. At some point the waiter became associated with the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the Rodian secretly provided the Crimson Dawn-alligned bounty hunter Dengar with a pair of blasters disguised as a special meal to use to carry out an assassination of Lord Khamdek, the leader of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, during a meal at the restaurant. After Khamdek's death, a firefight broke out between Dengar and forces of the Mourner's Wail. The hunter used the Rodian as a hostage and the waiter was shot by a Mourner's Wail member, which killed them. As the Rodian died, Dengar thanked them for providing the blasters and offered thanks for their service on behalf of Crimson Dawn, before he pushed the waiter's corpse into another Mourner's Wail member.",
