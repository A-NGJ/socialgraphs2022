 "content": "Plennid was a male Human Republic Diplomatic Corps Minister during the period of time known as the Cold War.\nPlennid was traveling through the Deucalon Spaceport Plaza when he and his bodyguards were ambushed by the Kintan Kings, a violent Nikto gang who controlled large portions of the area. Plennid's bodyguards were killed, and, several Republic passcodes were on the bodies and were stolen and looted from by the violent gang. Desperate for some form of help, Plennid asked a traveling Republic-aligned hero if they could recover the passcodes. The hero succeeded, and defeated several Niktos in the process. Plennid then asked the hero to report to Ambassador Averdon in the Promenade region.",
