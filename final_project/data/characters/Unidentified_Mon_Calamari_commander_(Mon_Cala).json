 "content": "A Mon Calamari fought against the Galactic Empire during the invasion of Mon Cala as a commander. Throughout the conflict, the Mon Calamari reported to Admiral Raddus.\nDuring the Imperial invasion of Mon Cala, this Mon Calamari commander was aboard a Mon Calamari Star Cruiser in the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet. His superior, Admiral Raddus, was tasked with the defense of the southern polar regions by King Lee-Char and came up with a formidable tactic, which Imperial Governor Wilhuff Tarkin thought brilliant. Raddus requisitioned the Star Cruiser and others from the nearby Mon Calamari Shipyards and linked their advanced shielding together. Their combined shields created a large shield bubble around the small fleet. During the defense, the commander reported to Raddus that the shields were still holding at full power, to which Raddus retorted that they of course were. The commander then asked Raddus if the Imperials would ever become tired of losing and withdraw, with Raddus replying that he almost hoped they wouldn't.\nEventually, Tarkin's three Imperial I-class Star Destroyers began bombarding the northern hemisphere and the turbolaser fire began tearing through the Mon Calamari settlements. The commander soon reported to Raddus that a fifth settlement, Zeran Town had been destroyed. The commander then told Raddus that the bombardment was increasing its pace but had not targeted the southern hemisphere. Raddus told the commander that the planet's curve was in their favor, but once the Star Destroyers target them, their shields would only survive a few hits. Raddus had the commander order the other ships to de-link their shields on his command. When the commander asked what would happen in the meantime, Raddus said they would remain fighting.\nShortly after, Raddus received an message from Mon Cala's king, Lee-Char, which ordered a planet-wide ceasefire of all of Mon Cala's defensive forces. Raddus was shocked at this and refused to do so, saying they could not just give up. Lee-Char surrendered to Moff Tarkin but the man had the bombardment continue until the king was arrested. The Star Destroyers now started hitting the southern hemisphere, prompting Raddus to act. He told the commander to order all cruiser to launch. The commander refused to believe the cruiser would survive against the Star Destroyers but Raddus told the Mon Calamari that they would be sitting there waiting to die otherwise. The commander did so and the cruisers launched and made to the blockade. As the cruisers passed, two of them were shot down but the one which Raddus and the commander were stationed on survived and Tarkin let the last three go, saying they would be found eventually.\nThis Mon Calamari had orange skin and brown eyes. Raddus trusted him to report all news to him during the defense of the southern polar regions and had the Mon Calamari take his orders to the other vessels. When Raddus told the commander to have the cruisers ready to launch, the Mon Calamari had doubts of Raddus' strategy, although Raddus assured the commander that it would be better than simply waiting to die.\nThe commander wore aegean blue clothing with a vivid denim blue tunic over his torso. His sleeves were rolled short and his belt matched the color of his tunic.",
