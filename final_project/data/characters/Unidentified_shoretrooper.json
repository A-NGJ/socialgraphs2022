 "content": "A shoretrooper stationed on the planet Niamos, the Imperial eventually encountered and interrogated the fugitive Cassian Andor for suspected anti-Imperial activity. Prior to departing the area, they requested assistance from a nearby KX-enforcer droid. The droid then pinned Andor against a wall, having interpreted the stormtroopers verbal command to \"hang on\" to him literally until his return from inspecting a local shelter.\nAndor was eventually transported to face an Imperial judge, where he was charged with civil disruption, Anti-Imperial speech, fleeing the scene of anti-Imperial activity, and attempted damage to property. Found guilty and imposed a sentence of six years, he was then escorted away by two additional shoretroopers.\nThis character was voiced by Sam Witwer.",
