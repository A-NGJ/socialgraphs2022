 "content": "Brock was one of the ISB officers serving on the Reprisal under Colonel Vak Somoril. He was killed by the BloodScar pirates.\nShortly after the Battle of Yavin, Brock accompanied Gilling Agent Mara Jade to the BloodScar's base on Gepparin. In truth, however, he was commissioned by Colonel Vak Somoril to kill Mara Jade. Upon arriving on Gepparin, he waited until nightfall for his accomplice Gilling to ambush her while he distracted her. However, Mara used the Force to foresee the plan, so she was not caught in the planned ambush. When the pirates were awakened by the blaster noise, an unknown pirate ultimately shot Brock.",
