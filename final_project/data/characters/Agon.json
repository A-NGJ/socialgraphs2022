 "content": "Agon was an individual who lived on the planet Ridlay during the time of the Clone Wars. In one of the planet's total eclipses—which occurred every fifty years, bringing with it the appearance of beings that Ridlay's inhabitants believed to be ghosts—the beings instead attacked the inhabitants, driving them from their homes. After Jedi Master Mace Windu and a group of Galactic Republic clone troopers were dispatched to investigate the subsequent lack of communications on Ridlay, Agon was sent to warn them. Shortly after Agon's arrival, the supposed ghosts arrived, and Agon led Windu and the clones to the shelter where the displaced residents were hiding.\nAfter speaking with the group's leader, Windu wished to investigate the Ascension Well, where the spirits emerged from, and the leader assigned Agon to guide him. Once Agon, Windu, and the clones arrived at the Ascension Well, they were once again confronted by the beings, though Windu determined through the Force that they were alive and that their minds were conflicted. Before Windu could investigate further, Confederacy of Independent Systems leader Count Dooku subsequently revealed his presence to the group atop a Multi-Troop Transport.",
