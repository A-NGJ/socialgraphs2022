 "content": "Anspi'shel was a female Twi'lek who lived during the time of the Cold War and was an associate of the Rattataki Kaliyo Djannis. She had gang connections and she used them to raid ships. At one point she and Kaliyo raided an Exchange ship with out realizing it. Kaliyo managed to frame the raid on an innocent dock worker and claimed they were there to stop the raid to improve relations with the Exchange. It worked and though it paid off for Kaliyo, Anspi'shel ended up worse off later. At one point she saved Kaliyo's life in Ord Mantell by getting her to Nal Hutta but she did so in a way that humiliated her.\nAnspi'shel crossed the Exchange on Nar Shaddaa which put a bounty on her head. Cipher Nine aided Kaliyo Djannis in rescuing her from the Exchange though Kaliyo held a grudge against her and followed up by selling her out to a local bounty hunter in Nar Shaddaa.\nIf the agent player chooses a light side option, he/she can warn Anspi'shel of Kaliyo's intention to sell her to a bounty hunter and she will escape before Kaliyo returns.",
