 "content": "A clone trooper was part of the Republic task force that invaded the planet Xagobah in 19 BBY. During the ensuing conflict against the Separatists, the Republic forces, including the clone trooper, besieged Mazariyan, the citadel of the Techno Union Foreman Wat Tambor. When the Separatists counterattacked, the trooper was struck and killed by a missile from a Hailfire droid.\nA clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, the trooper was born on the planet Kamino to fight for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. In 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic dispatched a strike force to conquer the Separatist fortress world Xagobah. The clone trooper was part of this task force, which laid siege on Mazariyan citadel, a living-structure that was bioengineered together with native Xagobah lifeforms. The citadel was commanded by Techno Union Foreman and key Separatist figure Wat Tambor.\nThe trooper and the Republic forces bombarded Mazariyan from dug-in positions 500 meters away from the citadel, but the attack had very little effect due to the healing abilities of the fortress. After some time, Tambor launched a counterattack, sending hundreds of battle droids, droidekas, Hailfire droids, and spider droids to engage the Republic troops about 200 meters away from the citadel walls. The clone was part of the troops who engaged the droids and, like his comrades, broke formation upon engaging the enemy. Seconds into the fighting, the trooper was hit by a missile fired by a Hailfire droid and killed upon impact. His death was witnessed by the young bounty hunter Boba Fett, who was looking for a way inside the fortress to capture Tambor.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, the trooper stood 1.83 meters tall. During the siege of the Mazariyan, the trooper wore clone trooper armor.\nThe clone trooper first appeared as an unidentified character in the 2004 young readers novel Boba Fett: A New Threat, which was written by Elizabeth Hand.",
