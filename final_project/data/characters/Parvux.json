 "content": "Parvux was a male Zabrak scientist who worked on the Death Mark laser project on Alderaan for the Republic during the Cold War. When the Sith apprentice Lord Nefarid attacked the project, Parvux was saved by the Jedi Master Orgus Din. Parvux helped Din and his former apprentice temporarily disable the weapon, and Din escorted him to safety.\nA male Zabrak, Doctor Parvux worked on the Republic's Death Mark laser project during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. Based on the Core World of Alderaan, the satellite superweapon was designed to end the planet's civil war quickly and with minimal loss of life.\nHowever, the project was attacked in 3643 BBY by Lord Nefarid, the Sith apprentice of Darth Angral. Nefarid's forces overwhelmed the security at Mensaav Laboratory, but the Jedi Master Orgus Din arrived and pushed back the attackers. Nefarid was forced to summon the native Killiks as reinforcements, and Din barricaded himself and Parvux—the only member of the project he could save—in one of the lab's secure chambers.\nWhen Din's former apprentice arrived, the pair defeated a Killik ambush and discussed the issue of the Death Mark laser. After informing the Jedi Knight that the Mirialan Aleyna Hark was in fact a spy who had the weapon's targeting device, Parvux suggested shutting down several power generators to disable the Death Mark laser temporarily. While the Knight did so, Din escorted the doctor to safety at Wardpost Duvaal.\nParvux was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears in the Jedi Knight storyline on Alderaan as part of the mission \"Siege Mentality\". After the player and Orgus Din defeat the Killik Praetor, Parvux tells the player to disable three power generators to stop the Death Mark laser temporarily.",
