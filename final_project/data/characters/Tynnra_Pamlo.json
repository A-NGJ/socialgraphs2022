 "content": "Tynnra Pamlo was a human female politician who served in the Imperial Senate as the senator for the planet Taris during the reign of the Galactic Empire and was a member of the Civil Government of the Alliance to Restore the Republic as the Minister of Education and worked closely with Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service. She feared that an attack against the Galactic Empire and its planet-destroying Death Star would put Taris in mortal danger.\nTynnra Pamlo hailed from the planet Taris, which she represented as a member of the Imperial Senate during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Though a member of the Senate, she was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served as the Minister of Education in its Civil Government. In that capacity, she worked closely with Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service and received many reports about atrocities carried out by the Empire, including the Siege of Lasan, the sterilization of Geonosis, and actions on Ghorman. She worked with Airen Cracken to release counterpropaganda in hopes of gaining sympathy from resistance groups.\nIn 3 BBY, she attended Leia Organa's Day of Demand. When the Day of Demand ceremony was over, Queen Breha Organa took the hands of Tynra, thanking her for her presence, instead of congratulating her daughter. Palmo also attended several dinner parties at the Royal Palace of Alderaan hosted by Bail and Breha which actually served as strategy meetings where they discussed matters such as the assassination of Quarsh Panaka. At one of these dinner parties, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin unexpectedly joined them, which caused Breha, in an attempt to disguise the true nature of the meeting, to pretend to drunkenly accuse her husband of having an affair with Mon Mothma of Chandrila. Palmo raised her hand as if to block out the couple due to sitting right next to them.\nWhen the Alliance learned of the existence of the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets, Pamlo had no doubt of its existence but was wary of launching an attack against it. She wanted to consult with her people about it, and feared that the Alliance had no chance against such power. She also worried that an attack against the Empire would put her homeworld in danger of being destroyed. Shortly after the meeting on Yavin 4, Pamlo traveled back to Coruscant to publicly decry the Imperial battle station before resigning her office.\nTynnra Pamlo was a human female of Tarisian origins, with dark skin, dark hair, and brown eyes. She wore a Tarisian Amulet of the Robb.\nThe character of Tynnra Pamlo was created for the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, in which she is portrayed by Sharon Duncan-Brewster. Her backstory was fleshed out in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, by Lucasfilm Story Group creative executive Pablo Hidalgo.",
