 "content": "Ala Kimbo was a male Human from Corellia who was wanted by the Hutt Clan for unknown reasons. He believed that he could escape the Hutt Clan by masquerading as a prison guard at Desolation Alley. In 32 BBY, Jango Fett claimed the bounty and proved him wrong.\nAla Kimbo's Bounty is worth 4,500 credits alive and 2,200 dead. He was presumably taken alive as he was worth more alive.",
