 "content": "Pete Vandhaar, nicknamed \"Left-Hander,\" was a male Human criminal, who operated as a pirate during the Galactic Civil War.\nVandhaar was born on Therpsis, a small mining planet. Deprived of any paternal presence, he suffered a difficult childhood and developed a heroic personality to compensate for his melancholia.\n\"Left-Hander\" became an adventurer, a smuggler obsessed by the danger. He roamed the entire galaxy in search of thrills and credits.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, he was stationed on Providence as pirate captain.\nPete Vandhaar was a cynical man who seemed to always have something to prove. His eyes harbored a constant scornful look, but he would always joke and babble with friendly manners, although he was highly opportunistic and calculating.\nMore sociable than his colleagues, Vandhaar was nonetheless a rash trickster. However, he was quite charismatic and attracted a loyal crew, which never used unnecessary violence.\nHe liked wearing pilot's gear, always had a heavy blaster on his left and a vibroblade in one of his boots. A small cigarra never left his mouth.\nPete Vandhaar was created by Jean-Michel Ringuet for the ambiguously canon roleplaying aid \"Providence,\" which appeared in the French magazine Avalon 1. He was illustrated by Jean-Marc Emy.",
