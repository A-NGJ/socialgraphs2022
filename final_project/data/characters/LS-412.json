 "content": "LS-412 was a human male scout trooper that served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire. In 1 BBY, he and his comrade LS-515 were knocked out by the rebel Garazeb Orrelios while patrolling the perimeters of the Lothal Jedi Temple. His armor was stolen by the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, who used it to infiltrate the camp.\nLS-412 was a male scout trooper who along with his comrade LS-515 were assigned to patrol the joint Imperial and Mining Guild excavation camp at the Lothal Jedi Temple. While he and LS-515 were patrolling the perimeter on 614-AvA speeder bikes, they stumbled upon a holographic projection of Grand Admiral Thrawn from the Battle of Atollon. When they went to investigate, they were attacked and knocked unconscious by the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios, a member of the Spectres rebel cell.\nThe rebel Ezra Bridger stole his armor and speeder bike while the Mandalorian Sabine Wren posed as LS-515. Despite the presence of the rebel impostors, the absence of the two scout troopers was noted by a stormtrooper, who noticed that the two had deviated from their patrol route and never finished their perimeter sweep. Disguised as LS-412, Ezra was able to unlock the Painting of the Mortis gods, which led to the mystical World Between Worlds.\nLS-412 was a male scout trooper who wore white armor over a black uniform. He rode a 614-AvA speeder bike as part of Imperial military patrols around the Lothal Jedi Temple.\nLS-412 first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Four episode \"Wolves and a Door\", which first premiered on February 26, 2018. Despite not speaking in this episode Dave Filoni is credited for playing a Imperial Scout trooper.",
