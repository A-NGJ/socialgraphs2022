 "content": "Jaryn Minoze was a male Nikto spice smuggler who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nBy the time following the Battle of Yavin, Jaryn Minoze was a member of the ryll smuggling ring of the Chirq Council. The ryll smugglers transported the spice onto Corellia and unloaded it at a bunker in the Vella plains where they refined the spice.\nIn 1 ABY, a young man by the name Civius Bain got indebted to the smugglers Jaryn Minoze and Oret Sturm and was forced to work for the smuggling ring. His desperate mother Olivia Bain later met a spacer and begged to rescue her son. The spacer accepted and headed to the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer found Civius Bain in the bunker but the young man explained that he could not leave the smuggling ring since he was still indebted to the smugglers. The spacer therefore killed both Jaryn Minoze and Oret Sturm, allowing Civius to finally escape.\nJaryn Minoze was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jaryn Minoze was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives,\" published on June 8, 2006.",
