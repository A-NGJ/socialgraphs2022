 "content": "Padda was a Twi'lek who resided at Zirtran's Anchor and was a co-owner of Chabak's with his cousin Quink. Padda and Quink were relatives of Chabak's original owner, who took over when he disappeared mysteriously.\nPadda was the younger of the Chabak cousins and somewhat of a braggart, who liked to impress people with his stories of romantic conquest and and gambling victories. In reality he was the spoiled son of wealthy and influential Twi'leks on Ryloth and had very little experience away from his homeworld. Lacking any sense of reality, he remained oblivious of how many times he had been close to getting killed by customers who were tired of listening to him.",
