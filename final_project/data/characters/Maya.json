 "content": "Maya was a Human female who served as a Alderaanian Security agent and a member of Senator Bail Organa's personal security detail during the Clone Wars. Shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Organa sent her on a mission to recover cargo essential for weakening the Empire.\nMaya, a native from Alderaan, worked for the Alderaanian Security for a few months after the end of the Clone Wars. Following the declaration of the New Order, she was sent, along with Sirona Okeefe on a mission to Brentaal IV aboard the Banshee. On Sel Zonn Station in orbit above Brentaal, Maya encountered Imperial resistance and was badly wounded during a skirmish. She asked a group of spacers to fight off the Imperials pursuing her. Maya further convinced the spacers to help her retrieve Organa's cargo - an Alderaanian Security agent frozen in carbonite.\nThe spacers that assisted Maya are actually roleplayer-controlled characters in The Traitor's Gambit, the first adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, produced by Wizards of the Coast to supplement the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, Saga Edition. The roleplayers can successfully complete Maya's mission even if she dies during the skirmish, meaning that her canonical fate is unknown.",
