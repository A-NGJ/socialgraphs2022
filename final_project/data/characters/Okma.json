 "content": "Okma was a human male who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire's Coalition for Progress division. During the Galactic Civil War, he served aboard the IGV-55 surveillance vessel Enduring Pride. Between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, Okma and Minister Pitina Voor, the chair of the Coalition, observed as the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra and the assassin droid Triple-Zero were on the run on the planet Milvayne while a live feed from Triple-Zero's eyes was being broadcasted to the people.\nVoor argued to Okma that action was to be taken on Aphra and Triple-Zero while the captain was worried about the agreement the Empire had with Milvayne to keep an invisible presence. When the people of Milvayne then began to become aggressive over the pair's capture by some hunters, the minister ordered Okma to shoot them down. Okma then confronted Aphra on Milvayne and attempted to make her get Milvayne back on track for him. She then used a seismic pulse to knock him back and Triple-Zero killed him and his stormtroopers.\nOkma was a human male captain in the Coalition for Progress, or CFP, the Galactic Empire's propaganda division who served aboard the IGV-55 surveillance vessel Enduring Pride during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra and the assassin droid Triple-Zero were on the run on the planet Milvayne, being connected with proximity bombs that were set to detonate in less than ten hours. Triple-Zero's eyes were also broadcasting a live feed of his vision to the residents of Milvayne.\nAbove Milvayne, Okma, aboard the Enduring Pride, was discussed the situation with the chair of the CFP, minister Pitina Voor. He and the minister reviewed the viewing figures of Triple-Zero's live feed, which had reached the billions by then. Voor called it unacceptable, but Okma pointed out that an agreement between the Empire and Milvayne made it so that they could only keep an invisible presence. Voor shut his point down, comparing him a brainless stormtrooper, an irresponsible pilot and a hostile inspector. She told Okma to \"spit on can't\" and reminded the captain that they were public relations.\nWhen Voor inquired on tracing the broadcasting signal, Okma told her that they needed to capture the droid. Voor then asked of the public mood, and one of Okma's controllers reported the insurrection markers to be grade 2 on Milvayne. As Okma assured the minister that the Milvayne Authority, Milvayne's law enforcement agency, was able to control this, another controller reported that the authority had just captured Aphra and Triple-Zero. Voor requested the footage of this to be put on-screen. Okma suggested that the situation would be resolved by itself, and Voor asked to hear audio of Milvayne's residents.\nShortly after, Aphra and Triple-Zero escaped the Milvayne Authority, but were captured by the monster hunters Winloss and Nokk. Aboard the Enduring Pride, increasing reports of public aggression and civilian disrespect were reported and Okma told Voor that the civilians liked Aphra and Triple-Zero. Voor recounted Milvayne's status as a \"model Imperial planet\" and the agreement the Empire had with the planet's authorities. Okma assumed she meant that they should not intervene with Aphra and Triple-Zero, but the minister convinced him she meant otherwise and ordered him to fire the Enduring Pride's railgun. Okma argued that this would only cause more harm, but she forced him to fire the gun regardless.\nThe Enduring Pride fired at Winloss and Nokk's starship, with Aphra and Triple-Zero aboard, causing it to crash at Milvayne's underworld. Okma went down to confront Aphra with three stormtroopers and a number of cam droids. He commended her survival of the crash and tried to convince her that she would express her love for the Empire through Triple-Zero's live feed. After he stated his intentions to tear Triple-Zero apart to track the individual behind his live feed, Aphra tried to remind Okma that she and the droid were linked by proximity bombs. Okma told her that he would deactivate them.\nOkma then said that if Aphra did not comply with him, she would become \"compactor feed.\" Aphra then stated a code, which confused Okma. That was when the code triggered a seismic pulse, knocking Okma back and incapacitating Aphra. After the pulse was triggered, Triple-Zero was reactivated and asked Okma for his high-clearance access codes. Okma refused, and so Triple-Zero murdered the captain's stormtrooper guards and then tortured Okma for the codes before killing him. By the time Aphra regained consciousness, she Okma was hanging by his feed with his head on fire.\nOkma was hesitant to take action on Milvayne, being mindful of the agreement the Empire had when annexing the planet. He continued to voice this concern to Minister Pitina Voor. When Okma confronted Aphra, he tried to convince her that she was going to voice her love for the Emperor's rule through Triple-Zero's live feed. He further threatened to make the rogue archaeologist \"compactor feed\" if she did not comply. Okma was had light skin, brown hair and brown eyes.\nOkma wore a white jacket with a captain's plaque. He also wore black trousers, shoes, and a black cap and belt.\nOkma first appeared in the comic Doctor Aphra  29, written by Simon Spurrier, illustrated by Emilio Laiso and published by Marvel Comics on February 27, 2019. He was identified in the following issue, Doctor Aphra  30, which was also written by Spurrier, illustrated by Laiso and published by Marvel comics, on March 27, 2019.",
