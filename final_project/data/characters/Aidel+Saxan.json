 "content": "Aidel Saxan was a Human female.\nSeveral years after the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, she had become the first Five World Prime Minister of the Corellian system. She married fellow politician Denjax Teppler, but they divorced amicably some years later. At the start of the Second Galactic Civil War, she was middle aged.\nSaxan was assassinated by the Sith Lady Lumiya in 40 ABY during negotiations with Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon of the Galactic Alliance, the victim of a high-powered blaster shot to the chest. Thrackan Sal-Solo, the Head of State of Corellia, was suspected of involvement, which was proven afterward by Jacen and Lumiya.",
