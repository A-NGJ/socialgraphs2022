 "content": "Aldogh was a male Ortolan who served as a supervisor of the Ortolan colony on Hoth during the Galactic War.\nIn 3642 BBY, Aldogh was supervising an Ortolan colony on Hoth around the Crescent Canyon tech depot. When he discovered that Imperials had attacked the facility, he was able to send a distress call to Aurek Base, which sent a Republic citizen to assist. An Imperial officer named Korl Torin tortured Aldogh, who revealed to him about the gas pipes under the facility that could be used to blow up Aurek Base from below. When Torin left, Aldogh barricaded himself until the help could arrive.",
