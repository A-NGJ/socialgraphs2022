 "content": "\"Six-Ten\" was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nIn around 20 BBY, clone troopers launched a raid on a Separatist factory in the Outer Rim. They were tasked with stealing an encrypted file on a data chip, one crucial to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Separatist battle droids discovered this and attacked the clones. Six-Ten was tasked with decrypting the file, which forced him to rush. He attempted to decrypt the file, while his fellow soldiers held off the droids.\nThe droids overwhelmed the clones outside of the facility and entered the building. The clone troopers inside were killed, including Six-Ten, who was shot in the head. Unfortunately, a B1 battle droid recovered the chip and escaped in a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle, just before clone reinforcements arrived on the scene.",
