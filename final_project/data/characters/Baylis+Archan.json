 "content": "Baylis Archan was a male Human Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as an apprentice to Jedi Knight Sha Koon.\nA Human from Corellia, Baylis Archan was discovered to be Force-sensitive and taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple as an infant. Entering into the Temple academy, Initiate Archan was encouraged to develop his naturally heightened telepathic abilities during his training there. After graduating from the academy, Archan was chosen by the Kel Dor Jedi Knight Sha Koon as a Padawan.\nWhen the Clone Wars broke out between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Archan and his Master led the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic against the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, taking up the rank of Commander. Deployed to the planet Giju to lead the ongoing battle there, Archan and the men he fought alongside died in combat, leaving Koon to bring the battle to a successful conclusion. Holding him in her arms as he died, Koon sensed his passing through the Force; her connection to Archan was very strong, as she would feel a similar pain when her uncle, the esteemed High Council member Plo Koon, was killed during the first stages of the Great Jedi Purge.",
