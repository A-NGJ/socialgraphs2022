 "content": "\"Checkbox\" was a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic who served on the Arquitens-class light cruiser Stellar Rise during the Clone Wars. During the war, General Grievous of the Confederacy of Independent Systems infiltrated the cruiser, killing Checkbox as soon as he revealed his presence.\n\"Checkbox\" was the nickname of a human male clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic who was born on the planet Kamino, cloned from the bounty hunter Jango Fett. During the Clone Wars, against the Confederacy of Independent Systems between 22 BBY and 19 BBY, Checkbox was stationed aboard the Arquitens-class light cruiser Stellar Rise.\nWhile taking inventory of crates that had been picked up during a stop near the Kazlin system, he noticed something off about the boxes he was checking—a stone mite–like noise was coming from the one nearest him. As the clone looked closer, listening to the noise, a blue lightsaber belonging to Separatist General Grievous sliced through, hacking Checkbox vertically in two. Grievous had infiltrated the Stellar Rise in search of High Republic–era artifacts and had brought several IG-100 MagnaGuards with him for the job. Two of Checkbox's fellow clones later came to investigate why he was missing from his post only to be killed by the MagnaGuards.\nCheckbox had a meticulous mind, suited for administrative work rather than combat. As a Galactic Republic clone trooper, he stood 1.83 meters.\nCheckbox wore a helmet.\nCheckbox was created for \"Galactic Tales: Saber Truth,\" the second installment of the Galactic Tales series of short stories. The story was written by Richard Dinnick and was published in Star Wars Insider's 210th issue on May 3, 2022.",
