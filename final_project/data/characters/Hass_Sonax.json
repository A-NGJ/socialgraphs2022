 "content": "Hass Sonax was a Sluissi slicer in the employ of Cecil Noone around 0 BBY. A cyborg, she used a BioTech Industries Borg Construct Aj^6 cyborg headband in her work. Personal experience led her to despise Imperials.\nThe daughter of dockworkers, Sonax was one of six siblings. She and her five sisters worked twelve hour shifts at the Sluis Van Shipyards. When the opportunity arose for two temporary maintenance technicians onboard a Imperial Star Destroyer, Hass and her sister Resh signed on. However, she and her sister were treated very badly. After a blown fusion coil caused a thirty-six hour delay, the captain of the warship came to the tech room and executed Resh as punishment. This caused Hass to jump ship when it arrived in the Roon system.\nSonax's personality was irritable and withdrawn, due to the combination of the trauma from her sister's death and the cyborg implant she had installed.\nSonax had a BioTech Industries Borg Construct Aj^6 cyborg headband that she received while working for an accountant on Kelrodo-Ai.",
