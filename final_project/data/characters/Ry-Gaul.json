 "content": "Ry-Gaul was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic. Serving the Republic as a Senior General in the Grand Army of the Republic, Ry-Gaul fought in the Clone Wars against the Separatist Droid Army. When the Order was disbanded and the Republic fell to the Galactic Empire, Master Ry-Gaul went to ground; eventually falling victim to the Great Jedi Purge.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Ry-Gaul was educated by the Jedi Order at the Coruscant Jedi Temple; eventually the man achieved the rank of Jedi Master. Tall and imposing, Master Ry-Gaul was widely respected by his peers, considered to be very knowledgeable about the galaxy. A silent man, Master Ry-Gaul only spoke when he needed too, demonstrative of his deeply thoughtful nature. Having constructed a silver-bladed lightsaber during his time as a Jedi Knight, Master Ry-Gaul selected the young Teevan Initiate Tru Veld to be his Padawan around 32 BBY.\nDuring the Separatist Crisis, which plagued the Galactic Senate, Master Ry-Gaul and Padawan Veld were sent on many missions, keeping the peace during the Galactic Games on Euceron and ending violence on Radnor among many others. In 23 BBY, Master and apprentice accompanied Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Siri Tachi and Soara Antana, along with Padawans Anakin Skywalker, Ferus Olin and Darra Thel-Tanis on a dangerous mission to the Sith tombworld of Korriban. During this mission, the aim of which was to track down and apprehend Sith Cultist Granta Omega and mad scientist Jenna Zan Arbor, Padawan Veld's lightsaber malfunctioned, leading to the death of Thel-Tanis.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Republic, Master Ry-Gaul took up the rank of Senior General in the Grand Army of the Republic and led clone troopers of the 2nd Sector Army against the Separatist Droid Army.\nIn the last months of the war, Grand Master Yoda personally dispatched Master Ry-Gaul on a highly secret mission to the Outer Rim Territories. In his absence, he tasked his former Padawan and friend Jedi Veld to research weaponry in the Jedi Temple Archives, thinking that he would be safe there. During Master Ry-Gaul's mission, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Palpatine, revealed his true intentions to the Order and issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, which commanded the clones to turn on their Jedi allies and execute them. With the Order effectively disbanded, the Republic collapsed and was replaced by a Sith-run Galactic Empire.\nBecause he was still undercover, Master Ry-Gaul was left unaware of the events transpiring around the galaxy. However, he was intercepted by two scientists, Tobin Gantor and Linna Naltree, who assisted him in evading detection by the Empire by giving him false IDdocs and helped him return to Coruscant in search of answers. Learning that Tru Veld had died on Coruscant during the attack which left the Temple in ruin, Master Ry-Gaul delved deep into the Coruscant underworld where he met with Master Fy-Tor-Ana, now known as Solace. Master Ana had been tracking him, searching him out to warn him that Imperial Grand Inquisitor Hydra was also on the hunt for the former Senior General.\nDuring his time on Coruscant, Master Ry-Gaul had begun to discover a trail of missing scientists from around the galaxy, including his saviors, Gantor and Naltree. In the company of Master Ana and her companion, former Jedi Ferus Olin, Master Ry-Gaul met the young boy named Lune Divinian. Agreeing to help train the young Force-sensitive boy, the task soon became too overwhelming for the man, who had more pressing matters, and Divinian was sent to Olin's hidden asteroid base to train with Master Garen Muln.\nJoined by Ferus Olin's young friend Trever Flume, Master Ry-Gaul set out on a mission to rescue Linna Naltree from the clutches of the crazed scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Infiltrating her apartment on Coruscant, the Jedi Master and Flume were forced to go on the defensive as they escorted Naltree to a turbolift. Drawing his lightsaber as Zan Arbor and her security team closed in, Naltree injected Zan Arbor with the madwoman's own memory drug, wiping clean Zan Arbor's twisted, yet brilliant mind.\nHis mission complete, Master Ry-Gaul and his team of associates and allies were met with the dilemma of escaping Imperial City. Attending the Galactic Luxury Starship Manufacturers' Convention in a bid to commandeer a ride, Master Ry-Gaul used the Force to persuade an executive of Sleeker Systems to sell a protype of a new model. Soon after departing, the team noted a homing beacon attached to the ship; this discovery eventually allowed the group to uncover a mole amongst their number. Rebel leader Flame, who had worked with the group on many assignments, was revealed to be the Imperial agent Eve Yarrow. Acting decisively, Ry-Gaul ditched the ship in a remote spaceport while Master Ana left Yarrow on a remote world, the Jedi team was able to regroup back at the hidden asteroid base established by Ferus Olin.\nDespite their struggles and tribulations, the respite and solace that the hidden base promised proved false. Another turncoat had penetrated the group and all were betrayed as Darth Vader moved to destroy the base with his new superweapon. When the group attempted to flee, their remaining starfighters exploded, sabotaged by the traitor on the base. Stranded, Masters Ry-Gaul, Ana, and Muln gathered the young acolyte Lune Divinian inside an escape pod and saw him safely off the asteroid.\nThe three Jedi, colleagues from a dead era, stood side by side as they realized and accepted that the odds were insurmountable. Vader's superweapon was fired once, and the asteroid was destroyed utterly, killing all those present on its surface.\nRy-Gaul was known as a tall, dignified, and quiet man who seldom spoke. However, when he did speak, it was usually worth listening to, for his wisdom and experience made him widely respected.\nRy-Gaul was a powerful lightsaber combatant, but often prevented fights through simple intimidation. His technique, according to Obi-Wan Kenobi, mimicked Qui-Gon Jinn's version of Ataru. Kenobi further observed that, much like Jinn had, Ry-Gaul moved quickly for his size, his grace surprising while his great strength never flagged.",
