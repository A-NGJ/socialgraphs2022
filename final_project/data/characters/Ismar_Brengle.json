 "content": "Ismar Brengle was a Human female scientist who worked for the rebellious Sith Lord Grathan against her will on the Sith capital planet of Dromund Kaas.\nIn 3646 BBY, during the Cold War, Brengle was tricked into slavery during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire by Lord Grathan with the promise of exciting research projects. Although initially delighted, she soon came to realize she had been tricked into working for him. In an attempt to seek revenge against Lord Grathan, Brengle wanted to steal plans for advanced cybernetic limbs, created by another of Lord Grathan's scientists, Lanniter Droge, which she hoped to sell to a contact for a large fee.\nIn 3643 BBY, Brengle met an Imperial individual who was attacking Lord Grathan's estate. Pleased to see the destruction of her captor's property, Brengle asked the individual to download the cybernetic's data from Lord Grathan's main computer. Having shut down three separate terminals to allow themselves access the main computer, the spacer was able to download everything. Brengle was very excited and promised to pay the spacer for there help. The spacer later received a substantial reward for their help.",
