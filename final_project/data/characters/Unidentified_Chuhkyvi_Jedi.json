 "content": "A Force-sensitive member of the Chuhkyvi species was native to the planet Iskalon. As a Chuhkyvi, the individual had tan skin pigmentation, yellow eyes, four-fingered hands and a keen sense of smell. The young Chuhkyvi was inspired by the example of Kiro, a Chuhkyvi who became a folk hero among his species as the \"First to Swim,\" a designation he received for leaving Iskalon. Kiro, also a Force-sensitive, fought alongside Luke Skywalker and was offered Jedi training by the Rebel commander, although he ultimately turned down that opportunity. Sometime after 4 ABY, the young Chuhkyvi was inspired to similarly leave the ocean-homeworld of Iskalon, and became a Jedi in the New Jedi Order.\nThe Chuhkyvi Jedi was Force-sensitive and had an intense hatred for dishonesty and lawlessness. The Jedi held Kiro in high admiration.\nRich Handley and Joseph Bongiorno wrote the article The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series, published in Star Wars Gamer 1 in 2000. This article included roleplaying statistics for the Chuhkyvi species, and mentioned that at least one member of the species became a Jedi.",
