 "content": "Geph was a male Neimoidian who served as a sergeant in the army of the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire. In 3640 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Ilum while a battle that took place there. During the battle, Geph sold weapons from a stall in the Republic base camp. While at the stall, he wore white armor without a helmet. Geph had red eyes and skin and no hair.\nGeph appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Weapons Vendor for Republic players on Ilum. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Geph was removed from the game along with the rest of the Weapons Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
