 "content": "Dree-Tekes was a female Gran Jedi Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the decade leading up to the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Gran, Dree-Tekes was inducted into the Jedi Order where she received instruction in the ways of the Force, eventually being selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master. During her apprenticeship, Dree-Tekes was dispatched to the Gran colony world, Stend IV, in order to prevent the Army of Life from releasing clodhoppers on the planet.\nUpon her arrival on the planet, Dree-Tekes recruited four local Gran militiamen to help her in her attempt to board the terrorist group's delivery ship, the Majestic Gundark. As the freighter touched down on the planet to deliver its cargo of clodhoppers which were intended to be used in restoring the natural order of the planet, Padawan Dree-Tekes led her allies in a raid on the ship, hoping to destroy the cargo before it could be unloaded.",
