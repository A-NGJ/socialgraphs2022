 "content": "Kolac Pru was a Kaminoan male who worked as a freelancing scientist on the black market. During the Imperial Era, Pru hired the human Mahjo Reeloo as an assistant, and he created a clone of her. During this time, Pru was contracted by the Mandragonian Mob to replicate a sample of a thornsuckle plant, a poisonous species believed to have gone extinct. The Mandragonian Mob intended to mass-produce the plant to create a bioweapon. When Reeloo discovered this, she attempted to foil Pru's operation with a defoliator bomb. The device was activated aboard Pru's starship, and both he and the thornsuckle sample were presumed to have been destroyed.\nKolac Pru first appeared in the canon junior novel Pirate's Price, which was written by Lou Anders, illustrated by Annie Wu, and published in 2019.",
