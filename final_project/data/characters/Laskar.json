 "content": "Laskar was a Human male who occupied a place of high prestige on the planet Tirahnn during the Imperial Period. Once a small-time thief and a fence for stolen goods, Laskar eventually accrued a large fortune and influence on Tirahnn, and moved into a tower in the upper-crust community known as the Heights. Although by 0 ABY he thought he had put the past behind him, he received a shock when Corellian smuggler Han Solo—whom Laskar still owed a large amount of money to—broke into his home one night. Although Laskar desperately offered to pay his debt to Solo, the smuggler was only after information on Kharys, the Majestrix of Skye, which Laskar provided.\nLaskar appeared in Star Wars Annual  1, written by Chris Claremont and released in 1979. In the issue, Laskar was illustrated by Mike Vosburg.",
