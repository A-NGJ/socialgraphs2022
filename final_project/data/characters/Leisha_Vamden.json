 "content": "Leisha Vamden was a female Human who lived on the destroyed planet of Taris.\nShe and four other refugees, Fayem Schall, Urana Kiel, Vidas Kawats, and Semist Bada, were forced out of their local settlements by the Republic because of the high number of scavengers and thieves. They asked a traveling Republic aligned hero if he could recover a few items from their settlement, for her and the rest of her group. The individual defeated the scavengers and was able to recover all of the requested items. After the hero returned, all of the refuges gave their thanks.",
