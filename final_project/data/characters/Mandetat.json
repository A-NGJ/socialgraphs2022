 "content": "Mandetat was a human male who served the First Order as a technician on the Starkiller Base superweapon. He was one of the many personnel involved in the process of firing the weapon, manning a station in the primary fire control room of the base. He was present for the weapon's first use in destroying the Hosnian system where the New Republic Galactic Senate was located. He then took part in the preparations for the weapon to be fired at the Ileenium system, but the base was destroyed by the Resistance before the weapon could fire. When lieutenant Rodinon decided to flee the base, Mandetat also left his station and ran after Rodinon. While in the control room he wore a black Starkiller engineer duty uniform with static-grounded boots. Mandetat had brown hair and fair skin.\nMandetat first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. He was was identified in the film by a Technician saying: \"Technician Mandetat to 44.59 North, 104.7155 West.\" \"Baryonic Matter Conversion complete in Precent 12\", and also received a name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. He was portrayed by Jack Laskey, but was listed in the end credits as \"First Order Officer\".",
