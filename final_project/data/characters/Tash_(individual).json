 "content": "Tash was a male Human who worked selling medium armor in the market section of the Alderaanian Great House of Organa's estate in the Apalis Coast region of the planet Alderaan. He worked during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, in which he served as a sergeant in the military of the Republic-allied House Organa. He had fair skin, brown eyes, and brown hair, which included a small beard on his chin. While selling his goods from a stall, he wore armor and carried a blaster pistol.\nTash appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Medium Armor Vendor for Republic players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Tash was removed from the game along with the rest of the Medium Armor Vendors. His position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
