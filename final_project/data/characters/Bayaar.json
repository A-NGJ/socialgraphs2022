 "content": "Bayaar was a male Ansionian sentry and scout of the Situng Borokii clan of the Alwari nomads, who roamed the hill country and vast plains of the planet Ansion during the time of the Separatist Crisis, before the Clone Wars.\nBayaar, as commander of the Borokii overclan guard, welcomed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luminara Unduli, and their Padawans, to the Borokii encampment after they had arrived on Ansion to mediate a border dispute between the nomadic Alwari tribes and the planetary government, the Unity of Community, on the eve of the Clone Wars. The aim of the diplomatic mission was to prevent Ansion's secession  from the Galactic Republicâ€”a Sith- and Commerce Guild-led plot.\nIt was Bayaar who loaned a Borokii knife to Jedi Master Unduli to secure for the Council of Elders its required tuft of albino surepp fur, which would afford the Jedi an audience with them. Bayaar was struck dumb with astonishment when Unduli actually accomplished the feat and dismissed the fact that she'd lost his knife in the process: he mused that his offworlder friends were powerful indeed, and told them he would remember the moment for his grandchildren. Having helped make them presentable for their meeting with the Borokii elders, it was Bayaar who later advised the Jedi of the council's readiness, after its deliberations, to declare its acceptance of the terms of the Jedi's proposal to ensure Ansion's retention within the Republic.\nBayaar, the foremost warrior of the elite Situng Borokii subclan, also served as captain of the honor guard to the Jedi as they traveled back to Cuipernam to influence the final secession vote . While en route to the municipal hall where the Unity Council had convened, Bayaar and his troops successfully defended the Jedi diplomats against thugs hired by Soergg the Hutt and his majordomo Ogomoor, who had been tasked by Commerce Guild Presidente Shu Mai to prevent any Jedi interference with the vote to secede.\nBayaar possessed a confident, intrepid, but also a friendly and good-natured personality that was encouraging to the Jedi, who quickly grew fond of him. Professional in his demeanor, he and his guards, unlike the initially mistrustful Yiwa clan, were neither suspicious nor afraid of strangers.\nBayaar was, however, not entirely comfortable in his position of diplomatic go-between for the Borokii Council of Elders and his Jedi guests. He would much rather have been out on the prairie, patrolling a picket line, weapon in hand. Even so, Bayaar found that he rather liked the \"squinty-eyed offworlders\" who had been charged to his care, and the contemplation that any of them might be injured or killed troubled him greatly. He was delighted also with the ingenious outcome of the Borokii-Januul skirmish, masterminded by the Jedi to \"set an example\" for both overclans: not one warrior was injured or killed, though Bayaar had expected to lose many friends that day, among both his clan and the offworlders.\nBayaar, in his role as sentry leader, was richly attired in lightweight armor that gleamed in the sun. His six-guard outrider patrol that originally welcomed the Jedi rode impressively attired sadain mounts and bore traditional long knives and Malarian laser pistols. Proud generational warriors, members of his troop \"sat imperiously in their saddles.\"",
