 "content": "Ewane was a Human male who served as the Supreme Governor of New Apsolon, and was the father of Alani and Eritha.\nNew Apsolon had formerly had a totalitarian system of government, in which a small, wealthy population called the Civilized was considered much more important the the Workers. Ewane had been a hero of the common people and a leader of the local resistance. Because of that he became a prisoner of the secret police organization of the Civilized government know as The Absolutes, as a result of that his two daughters grew up without him, being raised by a fellow Worker, Lenz. After the revolution he was selected to run as Supreme Governor in the first free election. Ewane won, and later ran for re-election, winning once again. However, shortly after, he was murdered. His successor was his closest friend, Roan, a Civilized that fought for equality between Workers and Civilized. Roan was killed too, in a plan plotted by Ewane's twin daughters Alani and Eritha to achieve power in New Apsolon.",
