 "content": "Eekar Oki was a Mon Calamari male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, Oki was present in a meeting of members of the Jedi Order after they were contacted by Confederate General Grievous during his imprisonment of Jedi Master Eeth Koth, and was present later in the year in the Galactic Senate Building. In 20 BBY, Oki welcomed back lost Jedi trainees after they were returned from Wasskah, and in the following year he attended the funeral of the victims of a bombing at the Jedi Temple's hangar.\nEekar Oki, a Mon Calamari male, served as a Jedi during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, Oki was present among other Jedi, standing to the right of Finn Ertay, in the Jedi Temple's communication center when the Jedi Order received a message from the Separatist General Grievous. Grievous had captured the Jedi Master Eeth Koth and tortured Koth in the holographic message. Oki left shortly after Grand Master Yoda told the Jedi Initiates to leave.\nLater in the same year, Oki spoke with fellow Jedi Anakin Skywalker in a hallway of the Galactic Senate Building in the midst of a lockdown made in response to a bombing which occurred at Coruscant's central power distribution grid. Oki and Skywalker's conversation was cut short by the arrival of Senator Padm√© Amidala and Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, after which Oki walked away. In 20 BBY, the Jedi was also present when Padawan Tano, as well as the Jedi Initiates O-Mer and Jinx, arrived at a landing pad on the Jedi Temple's exterior aboard the Halo, having returned from being rescued by Wookiees on the moon Wasskah. There, Oki stood next to Ertay and several Wookiees.\nAfter the bombing of the Jedi Temple's hangar, in 19 BBY, Oki walked through the halls of the Jedi Temple, first passing Masters Mace Windu and Yoda, who were speaking with Skywalker and Tano, before also passing by Sora Bulq and Ki-Adi-Mundi. He also attended the funeral in honor of the bombing's victims, standing with his head down between Bulq and Senator Mon Mothma.\nOki had mottled blue and orange skin, as well as black eyes. He had a single barbel on his chin, which indicated youth.\nWhile in the Jedi Temple and the Senate Building, Oki wore brown Jedi robes and carried a lightsaber.\nEekar Oki first appeared, albeit unnamed, in \"Grievous Intrigue,\" the ninth episode of the second season of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, which first aired on January 1, 2010. Oki was identified by name in the episode's accompanying episode guide on StarWars.com, in its \"Trivia \u0026 Details\" section.",
