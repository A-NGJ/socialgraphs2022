 "content": "Zsu Val was a male Chiss who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Zsu Val was detained in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. In 1 ABY, an accident took place in the research facility. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Zsu Val, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nThe Chiss took shelter in Camp Epsilon, the most unsafe camp since it was located in the courtyard of the Imperial Research and Prison Facility, the place where lived the most dangerous undeads. Other survivors in the camp at that time included the technician Sogan Varga, the mechanic Nils Cridmeen, the Inquisitor Klex Fulgor, and the stormtroopers GT-643, KD-121 and HX-138. Zsu Val was in charge of the forward defense of the camp and used to recruit spacers who ventured into the Quarantine Zone to help him in that mission.\nLater, a group of spacers helped the survivors refugees of camp Camp Epsilon to repair a damaged Lambda-class shuttle present in the camp. The survivors and the spacers eventually escaped the Quarantine Zone altogether with the shuttle.\nZsu Val was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Zsu Val was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
