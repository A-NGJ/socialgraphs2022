 "content": "7173 was the designation of a human male who served as a member of the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire. In 14 BBY, 7173 was stationed on the planet Zeffo as part of a squad guarding an abandoned village and complained to another trooper about the low temperature.\nThe pair also discussed a skungus that had exploded in their commander's quarters, which 7173 believed had been placed there on purpose. When the other soldier revealed that his next assignment was on a covert mission with Purge Troopers, 7173 claimed to have turned down the same assignment as he did not want to abandon his post.\nIn 14 BBY, the Jedi Knight Cal Kestis killed 7173 when he was on his way to the Tomb of Eilram on a mission to restore the Jedi Order.\n7173 first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The trooper is one of the two participants in several conversations that can be overheard between a stormtrooper and a scout trooper on Zeffo, although it is not clear which of the two troopers is 7173. While 7173's death is not required within the game's storyline, this article assumes that the player defeats all enemies within the game.",
