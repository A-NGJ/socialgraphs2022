 "content": "Lessah was a female Nautolan who worked for the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. She worked as a Republic representative on the planet Taris. When the Arcona Senaru traveled to Taris hoping to analyze how the planet's wildlife had adapted to the post-bombardment ecosystem, Lessah served as his contact. Senaru believed that his research could help save his own planet's ravaged ecosystem, but Lessah was helping him just so she could advance her own standing. When a Republic-allied individual who was helping Senaru delivered the Arcona's scanner to her, they reprimanded her for her selfishness.\nRepresentative Lessah was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. She appears in the Taris mission \"Disease on a Distant World\".",
