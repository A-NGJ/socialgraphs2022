 "content": "Balek was a male Human Acolyte of the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was the twin brother of Wydr.\nDuring the Cold War, Balek and Wydr attended the Sith Academy on Korriban. During their trials, Balek and Wydr were called to meet with Overseer Harkun, who told them that they would never become Sith or beat Ffon due to how weak they were. However, if Balek and Wydr were to kill another acolyte, they would earn the right to go home. Balek didn't like the idea, however his brother believed that this would be the only way for the two brothers to leave the academy alive.\nAfter the acolyte entered the training room, Balek and Wydr cornered the acolyte. Since he liked them, Balek apologized to the acolyte, explaining that he and Wydr had to do this in order to earn their freedom. Both of the brothers immediately engaged the acolyte, but the acolyte eventually defeated them.",
