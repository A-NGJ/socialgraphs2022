 "content": "Nworb Yorel, best known as Big Nworb Yorel the Bad, was a Human male criminal who lived on Kashyyyk during the time of the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he was a member of the Canopy bandits, a criminal group that operated from a camp in the region of Kachirho. A tall man, Nworb Yorel had a cybernetic arm replacing his right arm and was known to often wear the helmet of a Rebel battle armor to hide his face.\nIn 1 ABY, Big Nworb Yorel the Bad was present in the Canopy bandit's camp when it was attacked by a group of spacers.\nNworb Yorel appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Big Nworb Yorel the Bad was added to the game with the release of the expansion pack Rage of the Wookiees on May 5, 2005.\nIn the game, Big Nworb Yorel the Bad was present in the Canopy bandit's camp on Kashyyyk. The camp was featured in the quest \"The Missing Researchers\" but Big Nworb Yorel the Bad was not involved in the quest, nor in any other quest. Big Nworb Yorel the Bad was known in games files as \"ep3_canopy_boss\", suggesting that this character was intended to be the leader of the Canopy bandits.",
