 "content": "Agen Kolar was a member of the Jedi Order in the Galactic Republic. In addition to being a member of the Order, Kolar was a Zabrak Jedi Master, a notable duelist, and sat on the Jedi High Council. He and Saesee Tiin were killed by Darth Sidious in a lightsaber duel alongside fellow Jedi Kit Fisto and Mace Windu. These four were the first casualties of the Jedi Purge.\nAgen Kolar was born on Coruscant prior to the Separatist Crisis. He was found to be Force-sensitive and brought to the Jedi Temple to be trained as a Jedi. He eventually rose up to the rank of Jedi Master. He soon gained a Padawan named Tan Yuster.\nKolar participated in the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict that sparked the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Alliance. As a participant, he was a member of the Jedi assault team assembled by fellow Jedi High Council member Mace Windu to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala from being executed by the Separatists. During the battle, Kolar's Padawan Tan Yuster was overwhelmed by B2-series super battle droids and killed. The Jedi Master recovered the blue kyber crystal from his fallen apprentice's lightsaber and later added it to his own as a homage.\nIn the last year of the Clone Wars, Grand Master Yoda experienced a vision of Kolar's death at the hands of Darth Sidious whilst on the planet Dagobah to learn the secrets of immortality.\nIn 19 BBY, Kolar replaced fellow Zabrak Eeth Koth on the Jedi High Council after Koth was forced to step down. He took part in many important discussions such as when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine requested that Skywalker be appointed to the Council. He was also present when Palpatine reported that General Grievous was hiding on Utapau and suggested that they dispatch Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The Council instead dispatched Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nDuring the last days of the war, Kolar was part of another team assembled by Windu, this time to arrest Palpatine—who was secretly Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith. Of the four Jedi Masters sent to arrest the Dark Lord, Kolar and Saesee Tiin were near effortlessly killed and the first two to die in the Jedi Purge. The other two Masters, Kit Fisto and Windu, also perished and Sidious transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and destroyed the Jedi Order.\nAgen Kolar's impulsive personality often led him to leap into battle without thinking and he was known to strike first and ask questions later. He was also considered a valuable member of the Jedi Council. Windu had a high opinion of Kolar's combat skills, which led him to recruit the Zabrak in the attempt to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Sidious, however, easily killed Kolar and Tiin. He stood 1.9 meters  tall.\nHe was a master swordsman of the Jedi Order and his lightsaber skills were widely celebrated and renowned. Kolar he was confident he could defeat anyone, but despite Kolar's reputation, Darth Sidious was able to slay the Zabrak Jedi with a single blow.\nKolar built his lightsaber in such a way that it used dual crystals, which allowed the color of the lightsaber blade to ignite with either his green blade or his deceased student Yuster's blue blade. The latter's weapon was used during Kolar's assistance in helping to arrest Palpatine, who killed him and Tiin swiftly.\nAgen Kolar was first created by Star Wars creator George Lucas, who originally intended for Kolar to be the character Eeth Koth in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. However, there are several differences between the characters' physical characteristics that Koth had that Kolar lacked. Lucasfilm soon decided to create a new character: Agen Kolar. Kolar was created as a new character for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. He went on to appear in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, and he appeared in a vision in \"Voices,\" an episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. However, it is the model of Eeth Koth that is used during the brief scene. Agen Kolar was portrayed by Tux Akindoyeni in both films.\nStar Wars: The Prequel Trilogy – A Graphic Novel depicts Kolar as having lines.",
