 "content": "Daiv Dekven was a male Human scout in the Rebel Alliance. In 1 ABY, Dekven was wounded on Dantooine while searching for a new place to hide in case of discovery by the Empire. He had to recover in a hospital at a pirate outpost. At the outpost, he met a spacer who was willing to check out a cave for him, to see if it was occupied by the Mokk.\nDaiv Dekven was a non-player character in Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He was one of many \"heralds\", NPCs that were introduced in August 2003 and were used to guide players to static points of interest and dungeons.",
