 "content": "Antaria Wellos was a female Chiss Jedi who had served the Jedi Order in the decades before the rise of the Galactic Empire and the fall of the Republic. While a Jedi, Wellos was considered to demonstrate a melodramatic personality uncharacteristic in her contemporaries.\nA Force-sensitive Chiss, Antaria Wellos was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order before the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Declaration of a New Order that marked the end of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Retreating into exile, Wellos took refuge on the planet Rori where she survived the Great Jedi Purge initiated by the Empire. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, Wellos was approached by a spacer traveling through a spaceport on Rori. The spacer presented Wellos with a Jinsu Razor lightsaber.\nAntaria Wellos was featured as a Non-Player Character in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, where she was involved in the \"One-Handed Fifth Generation Lightsaber\" quest.",
