 "content": "Yuv Kal Zaer was a member of a species that dominated Wild Space through scientific advancement centuries before the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Holding the title of lead design analyst, Zaer composed a report about the deployment of a weapons project against a planet cataloged as test environment JX967A24; the deployment was far more successful than the past three weapons tests, leading Zaer to laud the work of the project's master designer.\nYuv Kal Zaer was mentioned in the Codex entry \"History of Iokath: Entry 1\" in Knights of the Eternal Throne, the 2016 Digital Expansion for the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
