 "content": "Furran, sometimes known as Furran of the Intari, was a Filordus individual who worked as a permitor in Depatar. Furran was associated with the House Intari, and had a name that was common for the Filordus species. As Filordi were considered unusual by many other species, Furran had fewer job opportunities than other permitors, and the ongoing disappointments led to often seeming angry and gruff with other beings.\nIn 31 BBY, Furran made contact via comlink with visitors landing in a starship, hoping to be hired as a permitor by the visitors. Other prospectives included Gusimin the Honest, Koyi Kobad, Maltok, and Sadana. Furran and the other permitors were disappointed to discover that the visitors had already hired Fot Ducela.",
