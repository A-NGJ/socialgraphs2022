 "content": "A male Ho'Din Jedi Master served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive Ho'Din male was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, ascending to the rank of Jedi Master. Having constructed his own green-bladed lightsaber, he studied as a Consular, specializing in the art of healing and becoming one of the Order's healers. Selecting a young Human Initiate as his Padawan, the Ho'Din traveled the galaxy with the boy training him all he knew.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Master took up the mantle of General within the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic. Along with his Padawan, the Master was assigned to assist in the evacuation of the planet Nadiem following an invasion by the Confederacy. While ushering citizens to the rescue shuttles, he came a cross a young mother and her wounded child. Taking a moment to heal the boy's wounds, the Ho'Din Master marveled at the boy's sense of calm amidst all the turmoil. Suspicious of the boy's Force-sensitivity, the Ho'Din summoned his Padawan to take a blood sample of the boy, which came up positive for sensitivity.\nBecause there were limited shuttles off the planet, and the Order was in desperate need of new recruits, the Master offered to designate the boy for priority evacuation, if his mother agreed to give him over to the Order for training. Assuring the young woman that her son would reach safety at the Coruscant Jedi Temple within two days, she agreed, and her son was taken off world. Not long afterwards, the Ho'Din was forced into battle with the Separatist Droid Army to defend the refugees. Surrounded by battle droids, the Jedi was quickly overwhelmed by the superior number of droids.",
