 "content": "\"Gold Two\" was the callsign given to a female human Rebel pilot serving under Captain Jon Vander in Gold Squadron. She was one of the squadron members who escorted Rebel Senator Mon Mothma's starship, the Chandrila Mistress, to an important meeting on Dantooine. When the convoy rendezvoused with the starship Ghost, of Phoenix Cell, for refueling, Gold Two argued with some of the Spectres about some of their past missions, believing that the group attracted too much Imperial attention. When Imperial ships arrived, forcing the Rebels to flee, Gold Two was going to pilot her Y-wing; unfortunately, she was knocked out when Imperial fire hit the Ghost, and Ezra Bridger flew her fighter instead. After she recovered, Gold Two was present in the Ghost's cockpit when Mothma delivered the speech that led to the founding of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nThe woman known as Gold Two was part of the Y-wing starfighter squadron known as Gold Squadron, which was affiliated with the rebellion. In 2 BBY, Gold Two and her fellow pilots escorted a Taylander shuttle Chandrila Mistress carrying the outspoken Senator and rebel Mon Mothma into hiding. Mothma had incurred the wrath of Emperor Palpatine by denouncing the Ghorman Massacre. Mothma's colleague Senator Bail Organa arranged for Gold Squadron and Mothma's ship to rendezvous with members of the Spectres rebel cell in deep space.\nGold Squadron and Mothma's ship arrived shortly after the Spectres' VCX-100 light freighter Ghost had destroyed a tactical infiltration pod carrying an E-XD-series infiltrator droid. The Ghost then docked with Mothma's freighter and proceeded to refuel Gold Squadron's Y-wings. While aboard the Ghost, she conversed with the Spectres Garazeb Orrelios and Ezra Bridger about their role in blowing up the Imperial Communications Center on Lothal and Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Star Destroyer Sovereign.\nWhen Zeb claimed responsibility for the latter, Gold Two chastised them for their stunt because it had caused the Galactic Empire to tighten security across the Outer Rim Territories. When she blamed the Spectres for making their life harder, Zeb retorted that they like doing things the hard way. Gold Two's Captain Jon Vander then joined the conversation and reprimanded the Spectres for alerting the Empire by destroying the infiltration pod. Ezra then responded that the other rebels should have given them more information rather than being so secretive.\nWhen the Spectres' astromech droid Chopper uttered an insult, Gold Two took offense. The Spectres' captain Hera Syndulla tried to calm the argument by saying that her crew did the best with the information they had. Mon Mothma's senatorial aide Erskin Semaj then added that the tactical probe droid was probably looking for them. Shortly later, an Imperial Arquitens-class command cruiser and Gozanti-class cruiser exited hyperspace and began attacking the rebel ships. Gold Two fell off a platform and was knocked unconscious. Hera took her to a medical bay while Ezra flew her starfighter.\nAfter the rebels eluded a trap set by Grand Admiral Thrawn in the Archeon Nebula, the rebels managed to reach the planet Dantooine. There, Gold Two praised Ezra for his bravery and piloting skills and invited him to fly with her squadron. Shortly later, Gold Two watched as Mon Mothma gave an impassioned speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion. Shortly later, the rebel fleet arrived above Dantooine and the Rebel Alliance was formed.\nGold Two was a brusque and hardened female human pilot who flew with Gold Squadron during the Age of the Empire. She was critical of the Spectres for taking risky actions against the Empire and making it harder for other rebel cells to operate. However, she gained a better respect for the Spectres after they helped her and her fellow rebels travel with Mon Mothma safely through the Archeon pass. As a gesture of reconciliation, she invited Ezra to fly with her squadron.\nGold Two first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Three episode \"Secret Cargo\", which first premiered on Disney XD on March 4, 2017. She was voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, who also voiced the antagonistic Governor Arihnda Pryce.",
