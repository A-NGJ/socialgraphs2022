 "content": "Bervin was a Human male soldier serving in the Rebel Alliance's Special Forces who was trained in cold-climate combat. In 3 ABY, he was among the 1,000 SpecForce troopers who were assigned to protect Echo Base, the Alliance High Command headquarters on the ice planet Hoth. After the Alliance's Commander Luke Skywalker was attacked by a wampa outside Echo Base, Major Bren Derlin ordered troopers to patrol the base's perimeters, with Bervin being assigned to one of the perimeter posts.\nBervin's perimeter post was attacked by a wampa, with its roar and his screaming being heard by Derlin and Alliance historian Voren Na'al via comlink. The wampa had killed Bervin and dragged him into the Hoth wilderness. Derlin and Na'al rushed to the post to find a blood trail leading through a caved-in wall to where Bervin was dragged out. Similar attacks on soldiers at perimeter posts were done by the wampas.\nIn 1989, Michael Stern created Bervin for \"The Horror By Night,\" a short story published in the West End Games sourcebook Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back.",
