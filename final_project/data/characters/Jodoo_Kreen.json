 "content": "Jodoo Kreen was a male Quermian Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic throughout the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive, Jodo Kreen was instructed in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order from infancy to the time he passed his Trials of Knighthood and elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. Serving the Order faithfully during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Kreen took up the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic as part of the war effort.\nNear the end of the war, Jedi Kreen was stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple when the Jedi High Council received reports of dark side activity in the Coruscant Undercity. Sent to investigate, Kreen came across the source of the malicious energy; the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar. Engaging Ezzar in lightsaber combat, Kreen was overpowered by the darksider and slain. Leaving his body where it lay, Ezzar fled the scene to fight another day. Two weeks later, the Heroes of Cularin discovered Kreen's decaying corpse as they tracked Ezzar across Coruscant. It was recovered and returned to the Jedi Temple to receive proper funeral rites.",
