 "content": "Shange was a Cathar prince and hero on his homeworld who opposed the Cathar joining the Galactic Republic. In 3661 BBY, Agents with the Republic Strategic Information Service took Shange and some of his followers captive and placed them in stasis in the SIS's The Tomb prison on Belsavis. Twenty years later, Imperial Non-Human Relations learned of his imprisonment and sent operatives to free him and his allies so their story could create a scandal for the Republic and the SIS, thereby leading more alien species to join the Empire.",
