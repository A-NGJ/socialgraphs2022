 "content": "Nuris Blaht was a male Caarite, who lived on Caarimon during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nBlaht worked for the Caarimon Ministry of Conservation and held the title Deputy Undersecretary to the Assistant Chief Subcounsel of the Greater Caarimon Communications Division of the Caarimon Ministry of Conservation. His job was to greet off-worlders when they arrived on Caarimon, although he didn't get to do this much, as not many people traveled to Caarimon. During the Clone Wars, he greeted the Heroes of Cularin when they arrived in the city of Joventusek on Caarimon.\nBlaht was friendly and enthusiastic about his job.",
