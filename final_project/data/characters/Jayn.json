 "content": "Jayn was a male Phindian mercenary pilot during the Galactic Civil War. He had a ship called Leilana's Dagger, named after his long-lost love Leilana. Jayne ultimately met his fate on the moon of Iope, in the Rinn system, while his skills were tested by the Imperial assassin X-7. Soon realizing that no reward was worth attempting to prove himself against X-7's onslaught, Jayn attempted to flee the system. Nonetheless, his ship was disabled and destroyed in the upper atmosphere of the moon. Ironically, Jayn had planned to return to Phindar and settle-down after collecting his money, like he had always promised Leilana.",
