 "content": "Mytus Adema was a human who served the Galactic Empire as a lieutenant in the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif. An ambitious man who disliked his superior officer, General Sotorus Ramda, Adema hoped to one day make a damning report on the general's behavior. Adema was on duty in the Citadel's command center in 0 BBY, when Director Orson Krennic of Imperial Imperial Military Department of Advanced Weapons Research arrived to retrieve information on communications made by scientist Galen Erso.\nShortly after Krennic's arrival, a series of explosions visible from the command center marked the beginning of a Rebel Alliance attack on the Citadel aimed at stealing the plans for the Death Star superweapon. During the fighting, Adema was fooled by false reports of rebel activity on several of the Citadel's landing pads but also reported to Krennic the rebels' genuine attempt to access the tower's data vault. Foiling Krennic's efforts to stop them, the rebels successfully transmitted the plans to the Alliance Fleet in orbit, before the Death Star itself obliterated the Citadel with a blast from its superlaser.\nMytus Adema was a human male from Planetoid A.17 in the Toria-vic Nebula who worked as a lieutenant in the service of the Galactic Empire. In the year 0 BBY, Adema was stationed in the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif under the command of General Sotorus Ramda. He was present in the Citadel's command center when Director Orson Krennic of the Empire's Imperial Military Department of Advanced Weapons Research division arrived there to retrieve from the facility's archives all recorded correspondence ever sent by Imperial scientist Galen Erso. Krennic's order caused Adema and every other officer in the room, save Ramda, to flinch due to the sheer number of records involved.\nAs Krennic waited for the correspondence to be delivered, a series of distant explosions visible from the command center were set off by a team of Rebel Alliance soldiers that had infiltrated Scarif's defenses in order to steal the plans for the Death Star superweapon from the Citadel. Adema and the other Imperials in the command center watched in shocked silence through the room's viewport until Krennic yelled at them to mobilize the Citadel's stormtrooper garrison and respond to the attack.\nAs fighting broke out between the rebel and Imperial forces around the Citadel, Adema began receiving requests for help and anomalous reports of large numbers of rebel attackers sighted at several of the Citadel's landing pads. Some of these reports were genuine, but others, including those from Pad Two and Pad Five, were false attempts by defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook and fellow rebel Corporal Stordan Tonc from aboard the stolen Imperial cargo shuttle SW-0608 on Pad Nine to distract the Imperial forces. Adema fell for the ruse and, after asking for confirmation from Pads Twelve, Ten, and Eight, ordered that men be sent to Pad Five, where no rebels were actually fighting.\nShortly after being fooled, Adema received a report of unauthorized access in the Citadel's data vault, as a three-person rebel team had sneaked inside the tower to find the Death Star plans while the battle raged outside as a diversion. Adema immediately reported the new development to Krennic, who was reading through the Galen Erso correspondences he had received so far. Krennic quickly worked out what was happening and left to confront the rebels in the vault with two death troopers.\nIn an attempt to prevent the battle station's plans from falling into rebel hands, the Empire destroyed the Citadel soon after with the Death Star's superlaser. Nevertheless, the rebels on the ground succeeded in transmitting the stolen plans from the planet's surface to the Alliance Fleet in orbit prior to their deaths, ultimately allowing the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.\nMytus Adema was a zealous, purposeful, and unusually ambitious young officer who disdained General Ramda's command of the Citadel Tower as overconfident and lazy. Adema watched his commanding officer's actions closely in the hopes of one day being able to provide a damning report on the general, thus supplanting him in the eyes of Director Krennic.\nAdema considered the Death Star a welcome and potent symbol of Imperial might that should be respected. When reporting the unauthorized access of the Citadel's data vault to Krennic, Adema's head twitched to the side, seeking support from other officers in the control center, but he received none. Adema had light skin, green eyes, and brown hair. He spoke Galactic Basic Standard with an aristocratic accent.\nWhile on duty at the Citadel Tower, Adema wore a standard gaberwool Imperial officer's uniform, including a cap with an officer's disk. He carried a private datapad in a shockproof case on his belt, the buckle of which also bore an officer's disk, and wore a code cylinder and a rank insignia plaque on his breast. The plaque showed two red squares and one blue.\nLieutenant Adema was portrayed by Jack Roth in the 2016 Anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The character's name was listed in the film's credits despite never being spoken in the film itself. Adema's first name, Mytus, was then revealed in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and published the same day as the film's release, December 16, 2016. The film's novelization, written by Alexander Freed, includes additional lines of dialogue for Adema when he speaks with Director Krennic that are not present in the film.",
