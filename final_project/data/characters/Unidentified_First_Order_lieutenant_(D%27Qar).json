 "content": "A First Order officer was stationed the on bridge of the Thunderer, a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer under the command of First Order Agent Tierny and Commander Pyre during their search for the supertanker fuel depot Colossus. After the First Order TIE Fighter Pilot cadet DT-533 was persuaded to hand in her personal comlink because Resistance member Kazuda Xiono had sent a transmission to it, the officer informed Pyre and Tierny that the cadet's comlink had been decrypted, allowing the Colossus to be located at the planet D'Qar, where a battle had recently been fought as the main body of the Resistance evacuated their base there.\nAfter the Star Destroyer's arrival in the Ileenium system, the officer informed Pyre and Tierny that the sail barge Galleon, belonging to the Warbird gang of pirates which had formerly worked for the First Order prior to being betrayed, had been scanned inside the wreckage of the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix.\nThe officer was killed during the rescue of Tamara Ryvora, when the battlecruiser was destroyed by the Colossus Resistance, killing the entire crew.\nThis First Order officer first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance Season 2 episode \"A Quick Salvage Run.\" He was voiced by Jonathan Lipow.",
