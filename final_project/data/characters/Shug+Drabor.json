 "content": "Shug Drabor was an legendary Anzellan male engineer. During the High Republic Era, he oversaw the construction of several MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruisers, including the Halcyon at the Santhe Shipyards on the planet Corellia.\nShug was born on Corellia, but primarily grew up on Chandrila. His mother was a welder that instilled in him the belief that a ship was only as strong as its bonds. As she aged, Shug began chartering her to and from the shipyards, taking on other passengers as well, inspiring him to establish the Chandrila Charter Company, which eventually evolved into Chandrila Star Lines when Shug decided to expand into luxury starliners.\nShug Drabor first appeared in the novel The High Republic: Midnight Horizon, which was written by Daniel Jos√© Older. He was later pictured in the first issue of the comic book miniseries Star Wars: Halcyon Legacy, which was written by Ethan Sacks, illustrated by Will Sliney.",
