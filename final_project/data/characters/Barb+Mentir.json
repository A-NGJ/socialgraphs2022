 "content": "Barb Mentir was a male Weequay pirate that was part of Hondo Ohnaka's pirate cartel. During a Galactic Republic mission to Florrum, Mentir and Turk Falso conspired against Ohnaka to take the spice meant for ransom for themselves. Mentir utilized a Flarestar-class attack shuttle to shoot down the Nu-class attack/transport shuttle carrying the Republic envoy. Eventually, when Falso's plan fell apart, Mentir was killed when Count Dooku used the Force to manipulate Falso into shooting Mentir during his escape.\nBarb Mentir was a male Weequay member of Hondo Ohnaka's Ohnaka Gang. When the opportunistic Ohnaka captured the Sith Lord Count Dooku and soon after Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, the pirates demanded a ransom from the Republic in the from of spice. When a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle traveled to the pirates' base on the planet Florrum, Mentir and Ohanka's second in command Turk Falso decided to shoot down the ship. Mentir piloted a Flarestar-class attack shuttle and used missiles to shoot down the Republic ship. The pirates then claimed the spice and traveled back to their base.\nHowever, the survivors of the crash would advance across the Doshar fields to the base, eventually assisting in freeing the three captives. As the Sith Lord escaped, he advanced on Mentir and Falso, who were outside with their ship. Choking Falso, he used he Force to manipulate him into shooting and killing Mentir with his own blaster.\nBarb Mentir was identified in canon in the book Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles. He was voiced by James Arnold Taylor, who also voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi throughout the series.",
