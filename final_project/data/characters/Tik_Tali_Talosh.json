 "content": "Tik Tali Talosh was the President of the Max Rebo Fan Club's Derf Chapter.\nTalosh was a Human from the planet of Derf who dreamed of auditioning for his favorite musician, Max Rebo. His dream came true when he was invited to play with Rebo's band at Jabba's Palace, shortly before the Battle of Endor.\nAfter the band broke up, he wrote a biography of it, entitled Blue Man's Group. Furious because he had not asked permission to publish the biography first, the band cut ties with him. Though disappointed, Tik forever treasured his brief status as a member of the Max Rebo Band.\nTalosh first appeared in Stop That Jawa!, and he was depicted as a three-legged humanoid with black hair, turquoise sclerae with red pupils and olive-colored skin. In Who's Who in the Max Rebo Band, he was also depicted as a blond-haired blue-eyed Human.",
