 "content": "Tase Somer was a human male who served as the Head Curator of the Coruscant Museum during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Somer was known by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra to buy and sell artifacts on the black market to fill the collection of his museum, and maintained a network of clients and sources. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Somer, along with several other individuals in his black market network, had his arm dismembered by the archaeologist Kho Phon Farrus, who sought artifacts of the Ascendant, a cult obsessed with replicating the effects of the Force. Sometime after Somer's dismemberment, Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros traveled to Somer's residence on the planet Coruscant to speak with Somer about acquiring an Ascendant artifact for Lady Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation. When they arrived at Somer's residence, they discovered the dismembered arms of Farrus' victims, including Somer's.",
