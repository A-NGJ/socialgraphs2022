 "content": "\"Dr. Gray\" was the codename for a Human female scientist working in Grand Admiral Thrawn's of the Empire of the Hand lab on a Sith–Jedi hybrid. Dr. Gray made several logs in a computer chip that was found by Jaden Korr. She was killed when the Sith–Jedi clones turned mad and killed everyone in the lab. Jaden hypothesized she tried to reason with the clones, but was decapitated near a turbolift in which the clones placed her head. Dr. Gray's recording was a vital warning to Jaden Korr about the clones.",
