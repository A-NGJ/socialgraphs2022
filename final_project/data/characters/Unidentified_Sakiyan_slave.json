 "content": "A female Sakiyan served a Hutt as a slave along with two other Humanoids and a Klatooinian. She sat beside the Hutt with one of the humanoids whilst he met with another Hutt and their slaves. The Sakiyan had black skin, and no hair as was common for her species. On at least one occasion, she wore a Gold neck piece and arm bracelet along with a white skirt.\nThis Sakiyan first appeared in a picture illustrated by Chris Trevas for the 2009 book The Essential Atlas, written by Jason Fry and Daniel Wallace. The picture that contained the Sakiyan was used in the book to illustrate Hutts and the various slave species of Hutt Space which served them.",
