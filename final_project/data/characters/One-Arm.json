 "content": "\"One-Arm\" was the appellation given to the female wampa that Luke Skywalker encountered in the ice cave on Hoth in 3 ABY.\nA female wampa resided in the ice cave on her native world Hoth in which Luke Skywalker was taken to after being attacked whilst mounted atop a tauntaun by amale wampa. When Skywalker awoke, he was dangling from the ceiling of the cave. Attempting to gain his bearings, Luke surveyed the cave and noticed the wampa was eating the remains of a tauntaun. Luke used the Force to pull his lightsaber from the ice and cut himself free, and escaped with a facial scar and bruises. In the process, the wampa lost her arm when Skywalker used his weapon to fend it off.\nThe wampa later became head of a band of other wampas, organizing them into a group capable of attacking the hunters who arrived on the world. They even devised how to stealthily break into Echo Base. When Skywalker returned to Hoth in 12 ABY with Callista Ming, the wampa recognized him, and tried to kill him again. The wampa was slain by Luke in the battle.\nThe wampa came to be known as \"One-Arm.\"\nWhile it is often believed that the wampa that attacked Luke when he was riding his tauntaun is the same wampa in the ice cave, it is not. The book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy labels the events before and during the Battle of Hoth and clearly describes both a male and female wampa.\nIn Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, when One-Arm loses her arm, the severed limb appears to be too short to account for her whole arm, which she is shown missing in the very next shot.\nThe wampa was portrayed in The Empire Strikes Back by Industrial Light \u0026 Magic employee Howie Weed.",
