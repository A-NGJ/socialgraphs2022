 "content": "\"Ando\" was the nickname of a clone trooper sergeant who served in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars, he was part of a battle group that was sent to the planet Kothlis to stop a Confederate invasion. Ando fought in the ensuing battle, which became difficult for the Galactic Republic since the Confederate General Grievous introduced a computer virus that jammed all Republic communications. Despite the new weapon, the Republic was eventually successful in repelling the attacks. Following the battle, Ando stayed with Clone Captain Drayk and Clone Sergeant Ven on Kothlis to coordinate the remaining troops.\nThe clone trooper sergeant nicknamed \"Ando\" was one of the many Human clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett that were bred on the planet Kamino to fight in the Grand Army of the Republic. In the year 21 BBY, the Galactic Republic dispatched a fleet of cruisers to the planet Kothlis. Ando and his battle group were part of the fleet and were ordered to defend the planet from an attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by the cyborg General Grievous. When the Republic fleet arrived near Kothlis, Grievous made use of a computer virus that jammed all Republic communications. Although their mission was complicated by the virus, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi ordered an attack in retaliation. Aboard the Republic flagship Indomitable, Ando and his comrades boarded LAAT/i gunships and landed on Kothlis, where they fought against deployed Confederate battle droids. Due to the superior number of droids, the Republic's ground troops suffered heavy losses. However, the technicians aboard the Indomitable were able to restore the communications that were being blocked by the computer virus, and the Republic fleet drove Grievous and his fleet out of the system, forcing him to abandon his plans of capturing Kothlis. After the Confederate fleet had withdrawn, Republic starfighters supported the ground troops, and the Republic was victorious.\nThe attack from the Confederacy left heavy casualties, and the remaining Republic troops had to be coordinated. Because Kenobi had been injured during the battle, Ando received the order to oversee the clearing work in conjunction with Clone Captain Drayk and Clone Sergeant Ven. In accordance with the command, they remained on Kothlis.\nSergeant Ando was raised and trained on the planet Kamino and, like all clone troopers, he stood 1.83 meters tall. He fought for the Galactic Republic's Grand Army and gained an order from Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to coordinate the remaining Republic troops with the help of Captain Drayk and Sergeant Ven.\nAndo was first mentioned in the novel Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth, the fourth novel in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars novel series. The novel was published in February of 2010 and was written by the Australian author Karen Miller. In the novel, Ando was mentioned in a conversation between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi after the attack from the Confederacy had been repelled.",
