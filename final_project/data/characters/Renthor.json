 "content": "Renthor was a Human male from Corellia. Along with Kym and Ulbert, Renthor was a former student of a Force-user who was not quite sane and had corrupted the Jedi Code. Despite having no aptitude for the Force, Renthor and his fellows took their teacher's creed to heart. Unfortunately, the corruption of Jedi Code caused them to believe that mechanical devices had to be destroyed.",
