 "content": "Shol Bestros was a Miraluka male Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire.\nA Force-sensitive Miralukan male, Shol Bestros was born several years before the beginning of the Great Galactic War with the resurgent Sith Empire in 3681 BBY. Unlike many of his species, Bestros turned his back on the Jedi Order until the Zabrak Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach recognized the youth's power and convinced the young Miraluka to join the Order. Bestros was trained in the ways of the Force by the Order and eventually attained the rank of Jedi Master by 3684 BBY, becoming a member of the Jedi High Council.\nFollowing the Great Galactic War, Master Bestros returned to the ancestral Jedi homeworld Tython with the rest of the Order and helped rebuild during the Cold War, residing at the Temple there. Hoping to construct a retreat on the Tythos Ridge, all attempts were foiled when the native Flesh Raiders invaded the area and established a camp there.",
