 "content": "Sora Tas was a female Zabrak Jedi who served the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. She was stationed aboard the space station Carrick Station.\nSora Tas appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as one of the endgame PvE gear vendor for the Jedi Consular class; her actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history. She was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
