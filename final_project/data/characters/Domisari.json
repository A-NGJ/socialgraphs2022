 "content": "Domisari was a female Human assassin who worked for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nDomisari pretended to be one of the many treasure hunters searching for a hidden treasure said to be on Space City. She was tasked with killing the Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole and his two charges, Tash and Zak Arranda, and was offered a hefty reward if she were to succeed. Dannik Jerriko killed her before she could get to the Arranda children and Hoole.\nShe was valued as an assassin by the Empire because she had no qualms with murdering children and women. Her matronly and grandmother-like nature and false kindness often allowed her to gain the trust of her victims, so that she could move in for the kill with her target off-guard.",
