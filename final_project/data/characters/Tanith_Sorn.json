 "content": "Tanith Sorn was a female Human who served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War.\nTanith Sorn worked as a bridge officer aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, where she developed a rivalry with her fellow bridge officer Lieutenant Ein Truminn. In 3 ABY, around the time of the Battle of Hoth, Sorn began to suspect that Malkor Trel, a crewman aboard the ship, was a spy for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Sorn's suspicions were correct and Trel decided to silence her to prevent his cover from being blown, by programming some of the ships ASP-7 labor droids to murder her. The droids killed Sorn and afterwards, a group of Executor crewmen, including Suba, were chosen by Darth Vader to investigate her death.",
