 "content": "An Aqualish male served as a governor and supported the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. In the year 19 BBY, the governor and his wife attended a gala held at the Senate Building on the Separatist capital planet Raxus to celebrate the Confederacy's bestowment of the Raxian Humanitarian Award upon its leader, Count Dooku. As the count spoke with his former apprentice, Asajj Ventress, at the event, he noticed the governor in attendance and thanked him for coming. The governor told Dooku that he was honored, and enthusiastically shook the count's hand. As a member of the Aqualish species, the governor had arachnid-like tusks which, at the gala, appeared white and polished. The governor wore a well-kept uniform while attending the gala, which was weighed down by epaulets and medals.\nThe Aqualish governor appeared in the 2015 novel Dark Disciple, written by Christie Golden and adapted from an unfinished eight-episode story arc for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series, which was written by Katie Lucas, Matt Michnovetz, and Dave Filoni.",
