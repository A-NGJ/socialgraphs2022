 "content": "Blasty was the nickname of a Clone tank gunner who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nLike all other clones, Blasty was a clone of Jango Fett. He was a clone gunner who served in the Clone Wars. He was a very obedient trooper, and, according to clone 1139, a kiss up. Blasty was also the only clone in his group with a nickname. Blasty had good skills and could hit a spider droid in the eye from a distance. He also knew how to drive a tank, even if it was a Separatist tank.\nBlasty was in the same squadron with clone troopers 1137 and 1139 during the hunt for R2-D2. 1139 hated Blasty. When Blasty took down a spider droid by himself, he got praise from all of his squadron except 1139.\nIn the first comic he is in, Blasty has an antenna on his helmet. He is only seen with it once, and the rest of the time he has a plain helmet.",
