 "content": "Urdig was a male Pureblood Sith living during or after the Cold War.\nTormentor Urdig was added to Star Wars: The Old Republic with Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion as a World Boss for Dark vs. Light system. Whenever the dark side of the Force reaches victory state on a server, Tormentor Urdig has a chance to spawn at one or more of selected locations on Tatooine alongside other Dark Side World Bosses. Though killing him is required for an in-game achievement, it is impossible to determine when his death took place.",
