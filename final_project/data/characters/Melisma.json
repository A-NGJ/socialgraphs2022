 "content": "Melisma was a female Ryn, and the sister of Droma. A refugee of the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was evactuated from Ord Mantell to Gyndine to Ruan. Along with many other refugees, Melisma was later taken from Ruan to Fondor by smugglers hired by the Peace Brigade. The refugees were left abandoned on a derelict space station to be taken as slaves by the Yuuzhan Vong when the extra-galactic invaders attacked the system. Melisma and the other refugees were eventually rescued from the station by Han Solo and Droma during the Battle of Fondor.",
