 "content": "Zirchros was a Hutt crime lord born around the year 5341 BBY who lived during the reign of the Galactic Republic. Around the year 3641 BBY, Zirchros possessed a secret cache of artifacts that his father had owned that had come from an extinct civilization. At that time, Zirchros was dying in his medical facility, and telling tales of his knowledge of the early Republic's criminal elements.\nZirchros was a male Hutt crime lord living during the time of the Galactic Republic. He was born around the year 5341 BBY, and he had a father who had obtained a collection of cultural artifacts from a civilization that had been extinct for some time by Zirchros's later years. At some point, Zirchros learned the location of the artifacts, and he also had a large amount of knowledge of the early criminal underworld of the Galactic Republic. When Zirchros came into possession of the artifacts, he kept them a secret. Around the year 3641 BBY, Zirchros was dying in his medical facility at the age of 1,700 years. As he stayed there, Zirchros told individuals about the old Republic underworld.\nOne individual who came to talk to Zirchros for some time was able to obtain information about the artifacts, obtain them, and bring them back to an individual they worked with.\nNear the end of his life, Zirchros was willing to share stories of his knowledge of early Republic criminal elements. At the age of 1,700 years, he had lived a long time for a member of the Hutt species.\nZirchros is first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG released by BioWare. He is featured in the archaeology crew skill mission entitled \"Memoirs of a Crimelord,\" which is available for players of both the Sith Empire and Republic factions. In a crew skill mission, the player sends one of their companions to complete the mission, but due to the mission being available to all classes, it is unknown who met with Zirchros. As a reward for the mission, the player receives some lost artifact fragments. The player can choose not to send their companion of the mission, so it is not guaranteed that anyone met with Zirchros.",
