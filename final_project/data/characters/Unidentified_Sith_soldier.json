 "content": "A Human male Sith soldier served under Darth Malak's Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War fought against the Galactic Republic. In 3956 BBY, the soldier was stationed on the Outer Rim world of Taris, which had recently been captured and blockaded by the Sith. A few days after the blockade began, he conducted a raid on the South Apartments of the Upper City, accompanied by two battle droids. When a Duros resident objected to his searches, the humanocentric soldier shot him with his blaster rifle. However, the event was witnessed by Republic soldiers Carth Onasi and Revan, the latter of whom was also an amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith. The Sith soldier realized that they were Republic fugitives and ordered his battle droids to attack, but the duo was able to defeat the two droids and kill the soldier.\nA Human male Sith soldier served under Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak's Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War fought between the Empire and the Galactic Republic. In 3956 BBY, the Sith sent a large fleet to capture Taris, an Outer Rim member world of the Republic. The fleet intercepted and ambushed the Republic cruiser Endar Spire upon its arrival in the system, and, although the ship was destroyed, several troops were able to survive by fleeing to the surface in escape pods; two such men were Republic war hero Carth Onasi and fellow soldier Revan, who was actually an amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith. After the battle, the Sith instituted an orbital blockade of Taris to prevent any of the surviving Republic forces from escaping. The Sith soldier was part of an occupation force that was stationed planet-side to restore local order and hunt down any remaining Republic personnel.\nA few days after the battle, the soldier, accompanied by two sentinel droids, raided the South Apartments of the Upper City, the highest levels of the Taris ecumenopolis. Onasi and Revan, who were hiding in the apartments, were leaving their room when they found the soldier arguing with two Duros residents. When one of the Duros, Ixgil, complained about the Sith's frequent raids on the building, the soldier shot him in the chest with a blaster rifle, killing him. The soldier then noticed Onasi and Revan and, recognizing them as Republic fugitives, ordered his battle droids to attack while he engaged the remaining Duros. The soldier and his droids were unable to defeat their enemies and were killed as a result. The second Duros thanked Revan for saving his life and expressed his hope that no more Sith would come to cause trouble. He then promised to move the soldier's body elsewhere to throw any investigators off the track.\nThe Sith soldier was an aggressive and humanocentric individual, referring to aliens as \"scum.\" He was also prone to anger, which caused him to react violently to situations, such as when he shot Ixgil for complaining. However, the soldier was able to successfully deduce that Onasi and Revan were Republic fugitives upon seeing them in the South Apartments, which had a largely alien population. The soldier had brown hair, dark eyes, and dark skin.\nIn addition to speaking Galactic Basic, the Sith soldier was able to understand Durese, the language of the Duros species. He was able to wield a blaster rifle, although he was unable to defeat Onasi and Revan, even with help from his two battle droids.\nDuring his raid on the South Apartments, the Sith soldier carried a blaster rifle and a backpack while wearing the gray uniform typical of Sith soldiers not equipped with armor. He used the backpack to store a frag grenade, a poison grenade, an adrenal strength stimulant, and an adrenal stamina stimulant.\nThe Sith soldier first appears as a non-player character in BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, a video game released for Xbox on July 15, 2003 and for PC on November 18, 2003. The character is featured in one of the early scenes on the planet Taris, the first planet the player visits after escaping the Endar Spire. The player encounters the Sith soldier after leaving the player's apartment hideout for the first time. The player does not have an opportunity to interact with the scene between the soldier and the two Duros until the Sith soldier identifies Onasi and the player as Republic fugitives and orders his droids to attack. There is no possibility of avoiding the fight, which occurs regardless of the player-character's gender or alignment in the Force. After the soldier has been defeated, the player can loot the soldier's remains to obtain his blaster rifle and the equipment contained in his backpack.\nIn the cutscene, a number of quotes are said differently from the dialogue subtitles. In the first case, the subtitles read as \"Okay you alien scum,\" but the voice actor clearly says, \"Right, you alien scum.\" In the second case, the subtitles read \"Hey, what's this?\" instead of the spoken \"What's this?\"",
