 "content": "Kufbrug was a female Gamorrean and the clan matron of the Bolgoink clan. She was a huge sow at nearly two meters in height and weighing over two hundred kilograms. She wore her long green-brown hair in braids and was covered with a large number of morrts. This plus her large number of children marked her as especially attractive to Gamorreans.\nHer original husband was the clan warlord Vrokk and one of her elder daughters was Gundruk. Kufbrug and Guth were in love. When Vrokk died and Guth was framed and expected to be killed, Kufbrug fell into a depression. This was lifted when Callista Ming recruited her for help with the kheilwar that had killed Vrokk. The pair fought the insect for an entire night before killing it, clearing Guth's name. Kufbrug and Guth were then married.\nKufbrug was particularly intelligent for an unmodified Gamorrean, able to puzzle out forgery and think of contingencies, to the surprise of Callista Ming. While she was seen as an incredibly attractive and commanding person, she was also sentimental and became depressed when she believed her beloved Guth would be killed.",
