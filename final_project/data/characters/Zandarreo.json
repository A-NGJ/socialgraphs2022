 "content": "Zandarreo, also known as the Jetsam of Lasan was a Lasat gladiator who was among the enslaved combatants at the Grakkus Arena on Nar Shaddaa. Zandarreo was scheduled to face the Wookiee Wrollanppf in a match to the death, according to a preliminary advertisement presented by Toren to Grakkus the Hutt, which billed the pair as \"One-Eye Volant the Eviscerator\" and \"Zandarreo, Jetsam of Lasan.\" A copy of the poster promoting Zandarreo's prospective match against Wrollanppf was placed in the pages of Maz Kanata's Smuggler's Guide while it was in Toren's possession.\nZandarreo was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide by Daniel Wallace.",
