 "content": "Janice Nall was a female Twi'lek who ran a droid shop located on the upper levels of Taris during the Jedi Civil War. Her droid business suffered due to the confiscation of her assault droids by the occupying Sith authorities in 3956 BBY, and the bigoted attitudes of the planet's Human nobility.\nIn 3956 BBY, when the Sith Empire occupied Taris, Janice Nall had most of her droids confiscated by the Sith. She suspected that the Sith either feared that insurgents would buy the droids to use against them or desired the droids for their own operations. Consequently, when the former Sith Lord Revan visited the shop with his companions, she possessed only two utility droids—both of them T3-series—in stock.\nThe cheaper of the two, T3-H8, was purchased by Revan. The droid had recently undergone repairs that quickly proved inadequate when it exploded as soon as it left the store. A disappointed Revan secured the full refund of 50 credits, and possibly more to compensate for the trouble, in accordance with Nall's policy.\nThe far more expensive T3-M4, heavily customized for unrivaled expertise at security slicing, was commissioned specifically by the Exchange crime lord Davik Kang. When Revan came to purchase the droid, he deceived Nall into believing that he was collecting it for Kang. Unbeknownst to Nall, the Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo responsible for setting up the order had conspired with Revan and his companions to use the droid to break into the Sith military base and steal the launch codes needed to bypass the Sith blockade.\nAs a Twi'lek citizen of the Upper City of Taris, Janice Nall was accustomed to the prejudice against non-humans that pervaded upper-class Tarisian society. Because of this speciesism, Nall had to work extra hard for her business to thrive, and she was passionate about defying the societal expectations of female Twi'leks to be little more than sexualized dancers, much less mechanics or business owners. She was indeed hardworking and committed to her job, a diligence motivated in part by her deep sentiment for droids. From her perspective, droids lacked the fatal flaws ubiquitous among all species. She believed that no droid would lust for violence as sentients did and that there was no such thing as an inherently malicious droid, only those misused by immoral owners. The prejudice she suffered discouraged her from mingling with the locals, and she much preferred the company of her droids.\nIn the context of the dueling ring run by Ajuur, Nall was disgusted by the prospect of bloodshed for the sake of entertainment. She was moreover disdainful towards swoop gangs, seeing them as nothing but thugs that wreaked havoc throughout the Lower City. In spite of this, she found the Hidden Beks tolerable, and had on occasion sold droids to them.\nJanice Nall was an expert droid technician who possessed the skills necessary to run a relatively successful droid business even in a city where speciesism against non-humans was the norm. Her reputation was notable enough to warrant the attention of the Exchange, who entrusted her with providing a top-of-the-line security hacking droid. In spite of this, her skills fell short in the reconditioning of the T3-H8 unit, which continued to be faulty and prone to self-destruction even after her repairs.",
