 "content": "Don Danga was a Human male who served as the patriarch of the Danga family on Sulon during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 BBY, his estate was attacked by a Corellian light freighter controlled by Imperial commandos of the Ghost Battalion, in an attempt to blame the Rebel Alliance. When his family was killed, Don Danga was around his maintenance shed and tried to hit the freighter with a shoulder-launched device. Energy bolts hit him and the missile he was trying to reload, and he disappeared in an explosion blast.",
