 "content": "Kaesii DuPree was a Human female spy who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nKaesii DuPree was trained as a spy by the Galactic Empire before the Battle of Yavin. During her training at the Imperial Academy, she encountered a man who became her lover. Kaesii and the man eventually completed their training and became spies for the Empire. However, although the man was later selected to join a spy elite corps, Kaesii was washed out of the program and assigned to Imperial Administration on Coruscant Growing frustrated by this situation, she finally deserted shortly before the Battle of Yavin without leaving any trace, leaving her lover without a word. Kaesii DuPree fled to the Outer Rim and established herself as a freelance spy and forger on Tatooine. Joining the local criminal underworld, she worked to undermine Jabba the Hutt's position on Tatooine. After the Battle of Yavin, DuPree resided in the city of Mos Eisley and used to work from the Lucky Despot cantina.\nIn 1 ABY, Kaesii DuPree learnt that a manager of the White Thranta Shipping Company, Durr Roddack, had stolen plans for a military prototype speeder. The White Thranta Shipping Company was a front for Jabba the Hutt's criminal organization but the Roddack had stolen the plans for his own profit, without informing Jabba. DuPree then dispatched a spy trained by her associate Lercer Gaia to infiltrate the White Thranta Shipping base to recover the plans. After the spy succeeded in the mission, Kaesii DuPre contacted one of Roddack's rivals to announce that she could sell him the plans. Durr Roddack learnt about the offer and started panicking, thereby convincing DuPre and her buyer that the plans were authentic. Finally, Kaesii DuPree threatened Roddack to reveal the theft of the plans to Jabba and blackmailed him to get extra money.\nKaesii DuPree later recommended the spy to another associate, Sarlis Beni, for a mission with the objective to retrieve a datapad with sensitive information stolen from the Incom Corporation by a gang of pirates.\nKaesii DuPree was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Kaesii DuPree was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
