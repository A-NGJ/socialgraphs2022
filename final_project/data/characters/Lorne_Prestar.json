 "content": "Lorne Prestar was a Human male, who was the Chief of Security in Mos Taike on Tatooine, and a Mos Taike veteran guard during the Galactic Civil War.\nDuring 1 ABY, Lorne Prestar received a complaint from a tourist of Mos Taike concerning a worrt near town was harassing the locals. He thought nothing of it, until he received further complaints from tourists. Frustrated with the worrt situation, he hired a spacer to seek and kill the animal. The spacer easily succeeded in doing so, much to the delight of Prestar.\nUnfortunately, Prestar later learned from Gramm Rile that a mutant mound mite attacked a Sand Dragon 'Fresher sales representative. Prestar was unsure if Mos Taike had a serious infestation problem, or if the worrt was in fact not the critter which was bothering the locals. Either way, Prestar needed the spacer to find and kill the mound mite. The spacer once again succeeded, but Prestar's troubles were not at an end.\nIn town there was a local troublemaker who roughed up one of Igma Kotos' friend. Seeing as how her friend worked for the Corellia Times, Prestar grew worried that he and his town would receive bad press. He promptly instructed the spacer to find the thug and teach him a lesson, using force if necessary. The spacer found the thug and ended his life. However, it would not be the final mission for the spacer.\nPrestar received urgent intelligence that a Tusken War Party was advancing on their location. Prestar needed the spacer to defend the weak front while his guards covered the additional fronts. After a fierce battle, Mos Taike emerged victorious. Unfortunately, several of the guards fell, but the spacer survived, much to the relief of Prestar.\nLorne Prestar was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He gave a short series of quests to players in Mos Taike, but could also be found standing idly by in Mos Eisley.",
