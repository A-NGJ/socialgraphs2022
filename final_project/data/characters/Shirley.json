 "content": "Shirley was a talented singer who was known by her stage name, the \"Chanteuse of the Stars\". Shirley was particularly known for performing in front of celebrities and politicians, with her hit song I'm Just His Satellite being regarded as elevating the jaunt style of pop music to a more respectable level. In 3 ABY, her agent, Morti, was able to get her a gig performing for the Imperial Governor of Kabray at Kabray Station during a diplomatic summit. However, after she arrived, she refused to perform, exclaiming that the entire thing was simply a freak show. Morti was dismayed over her decision, as he knew the governor would be very displeased. He was all set to invoke a tough clause in Shirley's contract to get her to perform, but she had departed from her dressing room. Instead, Morti found Leia Organa and mistook her for his talented star. In order to keep from being exposed as a Rebel operative, Organa was forced to perform for the governor in Shirley's place.",
