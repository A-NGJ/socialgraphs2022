 "content": "Waif was a female Tarasin, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nWaif lived on Cularin, the Tarasin homeworld, where she was a member of the Bark Lovers' Alliance, a local environmental group. She worked in the Alliance's office in the city of Gadrin and knew Selima DeWitt.\nIn Find the Lady, the player characters can speak to Waif if they visit the Alliance's office.\nThe term \"waif\" refers to a being who, either by hardship, loss, or similar circumstances, were removed from their original surroundings. The usage of such a term is to denote a homeless or orphaned child, similar to \"street urchin\" or \"ragamuffin\".",
