 "content": "A male Human Force-user was confronted by the bounty hunter Boba Fett at some point during the Galactic Civil War. He wore a robe resembling that of the Jedi apparel and wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber in battle.\nThis character was depicted on the \"Forsake Fear\" card of the Champions of the Force, the base set of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game, which was illustrated by artist Monte Moore. Since the time period of the game is set around 0 ABY-3 ABY, it is uncertain whether this character may be identified as a proper member of the Jedi Order.",
