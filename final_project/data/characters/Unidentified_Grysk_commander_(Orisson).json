 "content": "A member of the Grysk species commanded six Prism-class BattleChiefs part of Grysk operative Jixtus's fleet. Around 18 BBY, they reported the Chiss Clarr light cruiser Orisson's encounter with the Grysk warships in the Rhigal system's Junkyard asteroid field. Jixtus's ally, the Chiss Patriarch Clarr'ivl'exow, accepted the officer's word; however, he did not know why the Orisson was there, as he had no orders that would have led her to the Junkyard.\nThe commander was mentioned in the 2021 novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil, the final installment in the Ascendancy Trilogy written by Timothy Zahn.",
