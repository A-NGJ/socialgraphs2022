 "content": "Karalan was a Krish smuggler and a member of the security staff of the Mytaranor Slaving Council.\nKaralan began his career working for crime lords in the Lexas systems, but instead of earning money, he only accumulated debts. He eventually lost his ship and was almost killed by a bounty hunter.\nHe managed to hook up with Talas Piran and Tir'uh, two high-ranking members of the Mytaranor Slaving Council, and they liked him enough to hire him for the security staff of their mobile headquarters, the Mandalorian Dungeon Ship Vanquisher.",
