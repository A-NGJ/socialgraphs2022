 "content": "Radrrl was a Wookiee who sought to spread the ideals of Life Day. He was one of four Wookiees within his family.\nDuring the Life Day festivities of 1 ABY, Radrrl resided on Endor and on Yavin 4 with his family. His family included Oraalarri, Anarra and Tebeurra.\nOraalarri would have spacers speak to Radrrl and other members of his family to learn more about Life Day. Though naturally sympathetic to the Rebellion, due to the Empire's enslavement of his species, he, like the rest of his family, welcomed Imperials to their home. They told these Imperials that while they themselves may not be bad people, corruption and darkness would consume them as they grow more powerful within the Empire.\nRadrrl was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. During the Life Day event of 2004, players could talk to Radrrl on either Endor or Yavin 4 to learn about Life Day.",
