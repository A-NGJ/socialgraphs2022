 "content": "Tivbak was human male who lived during the High Republic Era. He was obsessed with Svi'no Atchapat after they dated at a university. He used a tracker to track her, but he stopped when a court ordered him to stop tracking her. Around 230 BBY, he learned from the gossip holos that Svi'no would visit Corellia, and he went there to meet her, but Kantam Sy used a mind trick on him to make him go home and rethink his life.\nThe scene where Tivbak appears in The High Republic: Midnight Horizon is reminiscent with the scene with Elan Sel'Sabagno and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Attack of the Clones, both of them having background characters meeting a Jedi who mind trick the character to go home and rethink their life.",
