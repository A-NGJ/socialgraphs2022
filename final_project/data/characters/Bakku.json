 "content": "Bakku was a male Reigat, who was a member of Sleeper Cell V-16 for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nBakku lived in Downside, a slum area in Fabrillan, the capital city of the planet Malthor. He worked as strong man for a local gang leader there and also carried out duties as a bouncer at her bar. Around 0 BBY he was the muscle for Sleeper Cell V-16, a Rebel Alliance sleeper cell.\nBakku was quiet, intimidating and anti-social. He joined the Alliance because they let him be that way, rather than imposing rules and regulations onto him, like the Galactic Empire did.\nBakku was a fearsome combatant with exceptional strength and skill in hand-to-hand combat. He was also well skilled in a variety of weaponry, including blasters, grenades, and melee weapons.\nBakku would typically carry a Vibro-ax and a heavy blaster pistol. He had a weapons cache that contained a variety of explosives and six Fragmentation grenades.\nBakku was designed by Ted Stark for Cracken's Rebel Operatives, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1994. He was illustrated by Brian Schomburg.",
