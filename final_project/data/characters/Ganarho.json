 "content": "Ganarho, nicknamed \"the Exile,\" was a male Wookiee assassin who operated in the Anoat sector at the time of the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade. One of the few assassins in the sector with skills to rival the secret order of Kouhun, he was known to stalk and\nsmother his victims. Although his activity secured him a large fortune, Ganarho spent none of it and lived in squalor.\nSeveral months into the blockade, the Wookiee assassin joined the crew of a young smuggler from Burnin Konn, assisting on various missions.",
