 "content": "Drixa Dreul was an elderly Human female who lived on Tatooine in the city of Mos Eisley. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin a spacer who was working for Dyxle Pedette's Tasty Dried Critters came by her house to deliver an order of fast food. When the spacer got there, Drixa found out that the fungus dippers that she ordered were not there. She complained to the spacer that the spacer and Dyxle messed up her order, then sent the bill to Dyxle, minus the cost of the fungus dippers.\nDrixa Dreul was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Drixa Dreul was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
