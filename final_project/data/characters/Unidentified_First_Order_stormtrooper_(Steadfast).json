 "content": "A human served as one of the First Order's stormtroopers assigned to Kylo Ren's flagship the Steadfast. As Ren and his Knights strode through the Steadfast's corridors into the conference room, the stormtrooper noticed the group and made a comment to their fellow guard about the Knights of Ren, prompting their colleague to turn toward them and remark \"ghouls!\"\nThe stormtrooper was portrayed by Karl Urban in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, although in the movie credits, the actor is merely listed as providing \"additional voices\". According to Urban, he visited director J.J. Abrams while the latter was shooting the film and Abrams put him in a stormtrooper uniform, resulting in what the actor referred to as \"a really fun day on set\" for both of them.\nIn 2013, when asked if he would appear in Star Wars, Urban stated that he would never do a Star Wars movie because he was recognizable from Star Trek and he felt that seeing a Star Trek actor in a Star Wars movie would be a big turn-off for the audience. However, in 2018, he stated that if he was given the opportunity, he would be glad to be part of it, commenting on the way fellow Star Trek actor Simon Pegg was completely unrecognizable in The Force Awakens and that there were ways and means to make a Star Wars appearance happen.",
