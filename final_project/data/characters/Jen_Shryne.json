 "content": "Jen Shryne was a Human male from Weytta and a loyal citizen of the Galactic Republic. He and his wife Jula Shryne had a son, Roan Shryne, who like his mother was Force-sensitive.\nWhile Jula was abroad pursuing her smuggler career, Jen gave their son—against Jula's will—to the Jedi. This angered Jula to the point that she left Jen. Nonetheless, when Jula was reunited with her son after Order 66, she hoped that Roan would eventually get to reunite with Jen. Sadly, Roan was killed before such could occur.",
