 "content": "Windom Traducier was a New Republic Senate Guardsman who was a secret agent of the Galactic Empire in 5 ABY. Windom was part of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax's plot to attack the New Republic capital of Chandrila by using a transponder to broadcast signals that turned liberated rebel prisoners from Ashmead's Lock into unwilling assassins that attacked Chancellor Mon Mothma and other New Republic leaders. Following the attack on Chandrila, Windom was captured and investigated by the New Republic Security Bureau. He was promptly murdered by the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, who had joined the New Republic.\nWindom Traducier was an undercover Imperial agent of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax who worked as a New Republic Senate Guardsman on the planet Chandrila in 5 ABY. Windom was guarding the former Imperial Adviser Yupe Tashu when the former Imperial loyalty officer–turned–New Republic operative Sinjir Rath Velus and his friend Temmin Wexley visited Tashu seeking information on Han Solo and Imperial fugitives. Windom refused to open the door to Tashu's cell, citing protocol. However, Sinjir persisted and Windom reluctantly allowed Sinjir to interrogate Tashu. From Tashu, Sinjir learnt about a secret Imperial prison on Kashyyyk called Ashmead's Lock.\nAfter Sinjir and Temmin's team freed the Ashmead's Lock prisoners with the help of Han Solo, Windom installed a transponder above Hanna City's opera house under orders from Fleet Admiral Rax. The liberated rebel prisoners had been implanted with inorganic biochips and were central to Rax's plan to assassinate the New Republic leadership on Liberation Day. This transponder was used by Rax to relay signals to the former prisoners who involuntarily met up with Windom. Windom coached the former prisoners for the upcoming attack and equipped them with small, concealed graphene blasters. Traducier used his position as a guardsman to position the unwilling assassins near key New Republic officials including Chancellor Mon Mothma and General Crix Madine at the Old Gather-House and Senate Plaza.\nOn the eve of Liberation Day, Windom was briefing the former prisoner Brentin Lore Wexley when his son Temmin discovered them chatting. To prevent discovery of the plot, Traducier ordered Brentin to finish off the intruder. Brentin stunned his son and hid him inside a crate. On Liberation Day, the former prisoners received a signal from Rax which caused them to attack New Republic officials and military officers. Chancellor Mothma and Commodore Kyrsta Agate were seriously wounded while General Madine and Adviser Hostis Ij were rumored to have been killed. The attack derailed the upcoming Imperial–Republic peace talks with Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and set the stage for the Battle of Jakku.\nWindom managed to assassinate the defector General Jylia Shale and also freed Yupe Tashu under orders from Fleet Admiral Rax. Later, Windom was captured by the New Republic authorities and imprisoned for his role in the attack on Chandrila. The New Republic Security Bureau's investigation discovered that Windom had used a transponder to scramble signals to the inorganic bio-chips inside the heads of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners.\nLater, Sinjir bribed a New Republic guard into allowing him to visit Windom in the interrogation room. Windom taunted the former Imperial that the New Republic was too weak to prevent chaos in the galaxy. Seeking vengeance on Windom for hurting his friends particularly Temmin and his mother Norra Wexley, Sinjir stabbed him with a vibroknife in the sternum. Windom died from his injuries.\nWindom Traducier was a Chandrilan human man who had cresting wave of blonde hair, pale eyes, and a light scar on his chin. He worked as an undercover Imperial agent and New Republic Senate Guard. Traducier supported the Empire and regarded the New Republic as a \"hobbling, crippled, thing.\" Traducier was a deceptive man who led a double-life and could feign pliability. He was a capable killer who killed former General Jylia Shale and almost killed Temmin. Traducier was familiar with operating technology such as blasters and transponders. Supporting Fleet Admiral Rax's plan to rebuild the Empire, Windom let no remorse for his actions. His arrogance towards Sinjir caused his death.\nWindom Traducier first appeared as a minor antagonist in Chuck Wendig's 2016 novel Aftermath: Life Debt, the second instalment in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy.",
