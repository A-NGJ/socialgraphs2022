 "content": "Anya Razar was a human female who trained at the Imperial academy on Arkanis. Born on Coruscant, Razar was an ambitious student who strongly desired to become a member of a secretive group at the academy known as the Commandant's Cadets. She got her chance during a live-fire exercise in on Arkanis in which she arranged the death of Xan Lanier in a test designed to show that she was willing to do whatever it took to become a member. Besides joining the Commandant's Cadets, she hoped for a promotion in her next year to Raithal Academy.\nAnya Razar first appeared in Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy, the fourth and final junior novel in the Servants of the Empire series. The book was written by Jason Fry and released October 6, 2015. During development of The Secret Academy Fry considered but rejected an idea of proposing that the characters of Anya Razar and Captain Phasma from Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens were one-and-the-same.",
