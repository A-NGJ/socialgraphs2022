 "content": "Organa was the male Human Viceroy of Alderaan before he was succeeded by his son, Bail Organa. He was also the father of Rouge, Tia and Celly Organa.\nIn 32 BBY, the high houses of Alderaan came into conflict over the line of ascent to Viceroy. Known as the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, it strained the relations between the House of Antilles and the House of Organa in particular. A mediation delegation sent by the Galactic Senate maintained that the Organas had the proper claim to the seat, and this member of the family became the new Viceroy.\nThe first name of the character has not been revealed. He was likely married to Queen Mazicia Organa, although no official source has yet addressed this.",
