 "content": "Dahnis was a female Twi'lek from Nar Shaddaa. She liked playing Pazaak with men in particular, and so spent much of her time at the Pazaak Den. She also sold cards there. Meetra Surik stumbled upon her when she was searching for one of the missing Jedi Masters, Zez-Kai Ell.\nDahnis was an aggressive Twi'lek with a penchant for flirting with attractive males. She would often go out of her way to play with men rather than women, ignoring them outright if they asked to play if a man who caught her eye was present. She would often make snide remarks at their expense when she won games of Pazaak.\nIf one plays Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords as a male Exile, or brings Atton Rand, Disciple, or Bao-Dur into the Pazaak den with them, Dahnis forfeits her Pazaak match to your character. When Dahnis agrees to play pazaak with the player, the Exile instantly wins without any game triggered.",
