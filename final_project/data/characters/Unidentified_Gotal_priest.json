 "content": "The unnamed priest of H'kig was captured during the First Battle of Obroa-skai. The male Gotal was one among hundreds brought to Harrar of the Yuuzhan Vong priest caste, who oversaw the selection of those individuals worthy of being sacrificed to the gods after the military victory.\nHarrar spoke briefly with the Gotal priest, interrogating him about the basis of his religion. Harrar offered the priest the opportunity to recognize the Yuuzhan Vong gods, so that his life would be spared. The Gotal priest responded that only a false god would desire death and destruction, adding that his god made no demand for blood sacrifices. When Harrar suggested that the infidels' god had abandoned them in their time of need, the Gotal responded that they had not been abandoned because the Jedi still remained. The priest and the Intendant then spoke briefly of the dual nature of the Force. Harrar broke off the conversation, determined to exterminate the Jedi Knights.",
