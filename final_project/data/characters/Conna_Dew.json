 "content": "Conna Dew was a human female Elder from the planet Polyneus. She was an Elder of Cliff, the birthplace of New Republic pilot Wyl Lark. Lark had called Dew his friend since he'd been fourteen years old, ever since she had caught and scolded Lark for spying on a stranger's wedding feast. Some time after the Battle of Jakku but before 11 ABY, Lark visited Dew when he had journeyed to Cliff to consult with a Sun-Lama about treating a sur-avka's mangled claw. He helped her yank desiccated husks of dead creeper vines off her house as she told Lark that her old caretaker had decided to become a Sun-Lama at the age of ninety-nine. After working and talking for a while, Dew told Lark that the Hik'e-Matriarch is looking for a senator to represent Polyneus in the New Republic Senate and suggested Lark as the best candidate. Shortly thereafter, Lark did become senator of Polyneus.\nConna Dew appeared in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed.",
