 "content": "Hol Okand was a male Human who served as a starfighter pilot of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nFlying under the callsign Gold Six, Okand flew with the Y-wings of Gold Squadron in the early years of the Alliance. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, Okand played a role in disabling the deflector shields of an Imperial outpost at Kashyyyk, where he flew as Jon Vander's wingman, using his ion cannons to bring down the shields.\nWhile stationed at Massassi Station, Okand was befriended by Chewbacca, newly arrived with Captain Han Solo prior to the arrival of the Death Star. In the following battle, Okand lost his life after his fighter was shot down by TIE fighters.\nAlthough the Customizable Card Game states that Okand flew a Y-wing at the Battle of Yavin, he is actually seen in the cockpit of an X-wing in the film. Fansites credit Okand's portrayer as David Eynon.",
