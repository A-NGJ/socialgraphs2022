 "content": "The Nercathi clan was a Twi'lek family on Ryloth dating at least as far back as the Dark Age of the Galactic Republic. Among its members was Jedi Lord Newar Forrth, the protector of Ryloth during the New Sith Wars. Following the death of Forrth, clan members crafted three beautiful crystallite skulls to comemmorate the Lord. Each skull represented one of the primary Twi'leki tenets - Jasshi'rr, Waala, and Keysshi. Surviving through the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Imperial slavers raided the clan during the Galactic Civil War. To put an end to the relentless raids the clan allied with the Rebel Alliance, supplying much need troops in return for weapons and protection.",
