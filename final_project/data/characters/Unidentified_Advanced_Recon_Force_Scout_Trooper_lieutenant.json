 "content": "This Advanced Recon Force Scout Trooper served as a lieutenant early during the Clone Wars. The Clone Lieutenant, along with his fellow Clone Commander, was tasked with tracking down Jabba Desilijic Tiure's son, Rotta who was kidnapped by bounty hunters.\nGrown on the planet Kamino from the DNA of Jango Fett, a bounty hunter who became the template of the clone trooper army, this clone was a Clone Lieutenant and ARF trooper in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars who served in a regiment.\nAfter Rotta, Jabba Desilijic Tiure's son, was kidnapped by a band of alleged bounty hunters, the lieutenant was dispatched along with an ARF trooper commander in a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle to track down the bounty hunters and uncover Rotta's location.\nAfter tracking bounty hunters dispatched by Jabba himself to the B'omarr Order Monastery on the planet of Teth, the commander ordered the lieutenant to contact Jedi General Mace Windu, where the commander then informed him on the situation. The commander told Windu that the monastery was too heavily fortified for them to do anything by themselves, and received the order to stay hidden and to await further orders. Once Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and the 501st Legion arrived in the Teth system, the ARF troopers made their way to Skywalker's Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship with their Nu-class transport. Landing in the hangar, the lieutenant reported to General Skywalker that there were at least two droid battalions protecting the monastery, and that landing on the monastery would not be possible.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, the lieutenant was a human male that stood at 1.83 meters tall, had natural black hair, and tan skin. The lieutenant believed himself and the commander to be the best scouts in his regiment.\nAs an ARF trooper, the lieutenant was specialized in stealth and reconnaissance. He, along with the commander, were capable of flying a Nu-class transport.\nThe lieutenant was equipped with green camouflaged clone trooper armor, and was equipped with a holoprojector.\nThis trooper first appeared in the 2008 theatrical animated film, Star Wars: The Clone Wars.",
