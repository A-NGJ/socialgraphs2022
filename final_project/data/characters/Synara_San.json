 "content": "Synara San was a female Mirialan who served as a member of Kragan Gorr's Warbird gang during the era of the New Republic. The Warbirds raided the Colossus refueling platform on behalf of the First Order, which wanted to occupy the station for their upcoming war to reconquer the galaxy. Following a botched raid on a Darius G-class freighter, Synara was rescued by the Resistance pilots Kazuda Xiono and Poe Dameron who believed she was a member of the freighter crew, not a pirate herself. Kazuda, who had become a resident of the Colossus, helped get Synara permission to live on Colossus as a refugee. She contacted Kragan Gorr, who instructed her to remain on the platform and spy for him.\nAs Synara settled to her new life on the Colossus as an undercover pirate, she was torn between her loyalty to Kragan and her new friendships with Colossus residents, particularly Xiono and Tamara Ryvora. Synara helped save the Colossus from the rokkna known as Bibo's mother and warn the residents about the kidnapping of Captain Imanuel Doza's daughter Torra Doza. Synara's actions earned Xiono's friendship and he helped her escape from the First Order. Synara returned Kaz's favor by convincing the Warbirds to help Team Colossus when the station fled into space.\nAfter the Colossus escaped into space, Synara and her fellow Warbirds helped the Colossus residents on a few salvaging and hunting expeditions. She helped to foil the First Order agent Nenavakasa Nalor's plot to exploit tensions between Doza and the pirates and to capture the Colossus. Synara also helped Kaz and Jarek Yeager to rescue Resistance agent Norath Kev. When Kragan plotted a mutiny on the Colossus, Synara sided with Kaz and the Colossus residents and helped to defeat the mutiny.\nSynara San was born on the planet Mirial. As a child, San lived on the streets of Vanqor, and claimed that she learned how to shoot from her father, who took her hunting. Eventually she was saved from Vanqor's streets by Kragan Gorr, who cared for her as his own child. San regarded their relationship as a debt. During the New Republic Era, she became a member of Kragan's pirate gang, which had been hired by the First Order to attack the Colossus platform on Castilon, thereby pressuring the platform's owner, Captain Imanuel Doza, into inviting the First Order onboard.\nGorr sent the Neimoidian spy Hallion Nark to the Colossus as an inside agent. Nark soon gave them the all-clear for an attack on the platform. During the attack, San served as Gorr's co-pilot on his shuttle. While fighting Ace Squadron, the defenders of the Colossus, an individual fell onto the windscreen of their shuttle. Gorr and San shook him off and continued to cause havoc on the platform. However, a disturbance occurred on the comm channel. San tried to stop it, but it began jamming all of the shuttle's systems. The Aces used this to their advantage and shot down one of the pirate fighters, forcing Gorr to order a retreat.\nFollowing their failed attack, Gorr contacted Major Elrik Vonreg of the First Order to update him. San stood with Gorr when Captain Phasma entered the conversation, being very displeased with their efforts. Gorr promised her that soon Imanuel Doza would be begging the First Order to take control of the Colossus.\nLater, San led members of the gang in raiding a Darius G-class freighter in an asteroid field near Castilon. The freighter was carrying a cargo of Kowakian monkey-lizards, including an unusual giant one which devoured most of the pirates. San managed to survive by locking herself in a cargo crate, where she fell unconscious. When the derelict starship was investigated by Resistance members Commander Poe Dameron, Kazuda Xiono and the astromech droids BB-8 and CB-23, they discovered the unconscious San in the crate and, mistaking her for a member of the crew, rescued her.\nSan didn't wake up until she was already on Castilon, in a shuttle flown by Jarek Yeager. She initially punched Xiono upon waking up, but he told her they only wanted to help, and claimed that she had been rescued by two pilots, and that he and Yeager had volunteered to take her to the Colossus for medical treatment. San was surprised that she was being taken to the platform, and claimed that she had been a victim of the pirate attack, and that her identification had been stolen. Xiono and Yeager got her registered at the platform, but Yeager, who was slightly suspicious of San, told Xiono that if anything went wrong, it was his responsibility. San, once alone, contacted Gorr and told him where she was, and he told her to blend in and stay put until he had an assignment for her.\nSan got a job at the Colossus' loading docks, working as a salvager. She frequently argued with the other salvagers there, and got into a few fights with them. During her work there, she became acquainted with Flix and Orka, owners of the Office of Acquisitions, and regularly sold them unopened chests and crates the salvagers had recovered, due to the duo's love of surprises.\nSome time after her arrival, Xiono, who had attempted to befriend her, and his co-worker Tamara Ryvora came to the loading docks in search of a CoMar Tri-Tracker chip, which they needed to repair the tracking computer for the Colossus' defense turbolasers, a job for which Team Fireball had secretly been hired. San informed the two that they were in luck, as they had one chip left, and Ryvora, who took a liking to her, told her to charge it to Yeager's Repairs.\nAware that such chips were used in targeting computers, after Xiono, Ryvora and the droid BB-8 left, she climbed on top of the loading dock and took a look at the turbolasers with macrobinoculars, suspecting them to be out of commission. She contacted Gorr's gang, first speaking with Drell, before informing Gorr of her suspicions. He told her to confirm that the targeting computer was offline, so that if the Ace Squadron left the platform, the pirates could launch an attack.\nAlthough San had helped Xiono and Ryvora find the Tri-Tracker chip, Xiono admitted to BB-8 that he wasn't sure if he trusted her. While Xiono, Ryvora and Neeku Vozo were working on the computer, San, in search of more information, came to the repair shop, surprising them as Vozo, who was extremely literal-minded, hadn't warned the other two in time as he had taken orders not to speak of the tracking computer job as meaning he had to cover his mouth with his hands whenever he spoke. San claimed she had come only because the salvagers had a surplus of connector couplings, and was bringing them spares on the house. Xiono and Ryvora tried to hide the computer from San's view, and Xiono unconvincingly claimed it was a \"food steamer,\" but she had already deduced what it was.\nTo get San out of the shop, Ryvora offered to take her to lunch at the Colossus marketplace. At the marketplace, as the two women were talking after eating, they saw all five Aces depart the platform, on a mission from Captain Doza to escort in an important shipment, which led Ryvora to realize she had to get back to work. San got herself to a secluded spot inside and contacted Gorr, informing him he had an opening. The pirate gang shortly arrived to carry out a second attack.\nDuring the attack, after she had finished working on the targeting computer, Ryvora saw explosions at the loading docks and grew worried for San, deciding to run over and help her. Xiono sent BB-8 to assist. When Ryvora managed to reach San at the docks, she was shocked that Ryvora had actually come to help her during the attack, which Ryvora explained as being what friendship was all about. Accosted by one of her fellow pirates, San punched him out before he could reveal their association, which impressed Ryvora. After the pirates had departed, San thanked Ryvora for coming to help her, and went back to helping with the cleanup, her cover intact.\nLater, Synara San sold the merchants Flix and Orka a treasure chest. However, the treasure chest turned out to be full of thermal detonators. Flix and Orka accidentally activated the detonators but managed to throw the chest into the ocean before the detonators could explode. Shortly later, Synara appeared and offered to sell them a new chest, which they gladly accepted.\nDuring one of her salvaging trips, San recovered a wrecked Z-95 Headhunter. She contacted Xiono about it as she thought he could use some of the parts for the Fireball. When Xiono and Neeku Vozo arrived at the loading docks, she was just raising the wreckage into the platform. Xiono offered her lunch in thanks for her assistance, but she politely declined his offer. When she hopped onto the wreckage to inspect it, she heard a noise and recoiled at a strong odour, which revealed itself to be a small sea creature. As San and Xiono watched in disgust, Vozo was instantly taken with it, adopting it as a pet and naming it Bibo.\nLater, when she next contacted Gorr, he asked her why she'd missed several check-ins, and she defended herself by pointing out that she was busy spying. Gorr informed San that he had discovered that the pilots who rescued her were members of the Resistance, which surprised her. He showed her a picture from one of the freighter's security cameras, showing Dameron, Xiono and their droids inside the freighter. However, due to smoke and low lighting conditions, San couldn't recognize anyone in the hologram before she had to shut off her comlink because she heard Xiono approaching.\nWanting to find out more about her rescuers, and knowing that Xiono had seen them, San invited him along on her last salvaging trip of the day aboard her salvaging skiff. Once on the ocean, although Xiono got tired of salvaging rather quickly, San asked him about the pilots. He claimed not to know anything about them, and that they were just pilots, before adding that one of them had been \"kind of handsome.\" San suggested that she knew who Xiono was: a lover of secrets, like herself, a claim that he unconvincingly denied.\nAlmost immediately afterwards, San and Xiono became aware of an enormous creature under the water, and decided to return to the Colossus, only to realize the creature was going the same direction. Near the platform, they had to swerve their vehicle to avoid a huge tentacle that came above the water before smashing down. Arriving at the Colossus marketplace, San and Xiono attempted to warn people of the approaching monster, but were ignored, and two security droids attempted to arrest them for causing a panic. The sight of many more tentacles above water proved the truth of their warning, and San and Xiono were able to activate the pirate alarm that lowered the market's protective blast doors. When the door became damaged, San suggested that as she'd heard Xiono was a good pilot, he go help the Aces while she closed the door. Fiddling with the control panel's wiring proved the trick.\nAce Squadron and Xiono's borrowed Fireball tried to drive away the sea monster, which turned out to be a mother rokkna searching for her child Bibo. In the end, Tam managed to convince Neeku Vozo to return Bibo to his mother, ending the Bibo incident peacefully.\nUnder orders from Commander Pyre, Kragan Gorr embarked on a plot to kidnap Captain Doza's daughter Torra Doza in order to force him to accept First Order \"protection.\" Without informing her about the kidnapping plot, Kragan contacted Synara and ordered her to smuggle the pirates Valik and Drell inside Doza Tower. Synara reluctantly complied with the pirate captain's orders.\nAn unhappy Synara entered Aunt Z's Tavern where Torra, Kaz, and Tam took pity on her. Torra invited her to her room in Dozza Tower for a game of Drone-Blaster. During the game, Synara impressed Torra with her marksmanship. Synara claimed that her father took her hunting on Vanqor as a child. Synara used her visit to Doza Tower to map out the building's layout and security.\nLater that night, Synara met Valik and Drell, who arrived in a cargo container in the Colossus loading docks. Valik and Drell refused to disclose the mission to her but claimed that their heist would yield a lot of profit. Synara and her fellow pirates scaled Doza Tower with a grappling hook. While Synara waited outside, Valik and Drell overpowered the security droids and kidnapped Torra.\nWhile waiting, Synara contacted Kragan and confronted him about kidnapping Torra. When Synara demanded to know why he hid the details of the mission from her, Kragan chided her for getting soft and befriending the locals. Kragan ordered Synara to rendezvous on a skiff and bring Torra to him now. Choosing her new friends over her pirate band, Synara instead informed Kaz that Torra was in danger. Synara also alerted Captain Doza, who dispatched Ace Squadron after Torra's pirate kidnappers, who had fled on speeder bikes.\nDespite Kaz and Ace Squadron's efforts, Valik and Drell managed to reach Captain Kragan's sail barge Galleon with the captive Torra. Shortly later, the First Order Major Elrik Vonreg arrived in an Upsilon-class command shuttle. Kragan thought that Major Vonreg had come to pay but the First Order instead attacked them and rescued Torra. By rescuing his daughter, Major Vonreg was able to convince Captain Doza to accept First Order protection.\nThe following morning, a bitter Kragan informed Synara that the First Order had betrayed them and that their deal was over. Shortly later, Kaz thanked Synara for helping him with Torra. When Kaz questioned Synara about the two strangers from last night, Synara claimed they were offworld scavengers. In private, Kaz and BB-8 did not believe her and suspected that she was helping the pirates or was a pirate herself.\nAfter the First Order occupied the Colossus, Synara tried to buy passage offworld but was unable to secure a ticket due to a lockdown on travel imposed by the First Order. Realizing that the First Order were after her, Synara kept a low profile at her workplace in the docks, convincing her colleague Glem to let her work on the night shift in order to avoid First Order attention. Kaz became concerned about Synara after First Order stormtroopers visited Yeager's garage and questioned them about Synara's whereabouts.\nIn desperation, Synara contacted Captain Kragan for help. Since the First Order had imposed a tight cordon around the Colossus, Kragan was unable to help but told Synara to find her own way out of the station and arrange to rendezvous with the Warbirds. Kaz and BB-8 were eavesdropping. BB-8 was initially unwilling to help but Kaz insisted on helping because Synara had helped rescue Torra and save the Colossus from Bibo's mother.\nThat night, Kaz and BB-8 met up with Synara and offered to help smuggle her out of the Colossus. Though Synara was a pirate, Kaz wanted to help a friend in need. Kaz's initial plan was to smuggle Synara aboard a container onto a Star Commuter 2000. Though Kaz and BB-8 managed to get Synara aboard the ship, they were pursued by stormtroopers. Synara came to rescue and knocked out the stormtroopers. However, helping her friends cost her to miss her flight offworld.\nWith Synara unable to travel off the Colossus by ship, Kaz's friend Neeku advised Synara to escape via an escape pod in the depths of the refueling platform. Despite being pursued by stormtroopers, Synara and her friends managed to reach the escape bay in the lower levels of the Colossus. Synara wished Kaz farewell before escaping into the ocean aboard the escape pod. Synara then arranged to rendezvous with Kragan and the other pirates at sea.\nSynara's absence was noticed by one of her Colossus friends Tamara Ryvora, a colleague of Kaz. When Kaz explained that Synara was not uncomfortable with the First Order presence, Tam wondered why her friend had not bothered to say goodbye, unaware of her pirate identity.\nSynara and her fellow Warbirds were sailing Castilon's oceans aboard the Galleon when they received Kazuda Xiono's transmission seeking aid from Resistance General Leia Organa. Synara listened with concern as Valik played Xiono's recording to the pirates.\nAfter Xiono and his friend Jarek Yeager instigated an uprising against the First Order on the Colossus, Synara San and her fellow Warbirds came to their aid aboard the Galleon. San ordered the pirate gunners to take down the marauding TIE/fo space superiority fighters and managed to shoot down one. They then boarded the Colossus, which escaped into hyperspace.\nAfter the Battle of Castilon, Synara and her fellow Warbirds accompanied the inhabitants of the Colossus during their journey through space. Due to her friendship with Xiono, Xiono confided in her about the space station's dwindling supplies. When Synara discovered that Xiono had tried to contact his former friend Tamara Ryvora, San counselled him about the danger of being in contact with someone who had joined the First Order.\nLater, Synara helped Xiono convince her fellow pirates to take part in a mission to salvage a coaxium canister from the wrecked Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, which orbited D'Qar. To sweeten the deal, Synara promised the pirates that they could help themselves to the weapons and tech aboard the dreadnought. The pirates traveled with Xiono, Neeku, and Kaz's astromech droid CB-23 aboard the Galleon to the Fulminatrix.\nWhile the other pirates plundered the dreadnought for weapons and tech, Synara accompanied Neeku, Kaz, and CB-23 to the engine room. Despite being attacked by First Order forces under Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny, the pirates and their Colossus allies managed to extract the coaxium canister and install it into the Colossus's engine room. Following their escape, Synara asked Xiono and Neeku to consider how the First Order managed to track them down. She confronted Kaz about the conmlink message he sent to Tam. Though Kaz and Neeku refused to believe that Tam had betrayed them, Synara wasn't so sure.\nIn response to a food shortage on the Colossus, San and her fellow Warbirds agreed to help Kaz and Torra hunt a massive winged jakoosk on the icy world of Celsor 3. While Kragan was eager to hunt the jakoosk in order to curry favor with Captain Doza, she warned that hunting the creature was a \"fool's errand.\" As San had warned, the jakoosk proved too much for the pirates to handle and the pirates Snarl and Drell were left stranded. Ultimately, Xiono, Torra, and CB-23 succeeded in hunting down and killing the creature. Following the hunt, San forced Snarl and Drell to apologize to Xiono and Torra for abandoning them on Celsor 3.\nSynara San accompanied Xiono on a mission to rescue the stranded Nikto engineer Nenavakasa Nalor in space. Since the Colossus needed a second engineer, Captain Doza agreed to welcome Nena aboard the Colossus. While Nena claimed to be fleeing from the First Order, she was actually a First Order agent in the service of Agent Tierny. Nena befriended fellow engineer Vozo but used her friendship to drive a wedge between the Colossus residents and the Warbirds. She claimed that the pirates were draining the station's power source. In truth, Nena had been sabotaging the Colossus's systems in order to facilitate the ship's capture.\nWhile Xiono was investigating whether the pirates were draining the Colossus's power, San confronted him and managed to convince him of the pirates' innocence and Nena's duplicity. Though San, Xiono and Neeku were unable to stop Nena from escaping, they were able to reverse her sabotage, allowing the Colossus to escape into space. Kaz also managed to convince San and the pirates to unplug their power source so that the ship could escape into hyperspace.\nLater, Synara was present during a gambling game between Xiono and the Warbirds. Synara praised Xiono's success. When Xiono accidentally elbowed a cup into the path of the Gamorrean pirate Gork, San managed to calm Gork down.\nAfter the Resistance operative Norath Kev was captured by the bounty hunter Ax Tagrin on the planet Varkana, Xiono and Yeager enlisted her help since the mission involved \"bodily harm.\" San accompanied Xiono, Yeager and CB-23 to Vargo Spaceport where their presence attracted the attention of the First Order spy Lechee. They managed to track Kev's distress signal to a house but were attacked by Tagrin, who wanted to collect a First Order bounty on the fugitives.\nSynara managed to fight Tagrin, giving enough time for the others to escape the building. Following a struggle on the house's balcony, San managed to kick him over the edge. After reuniting with Xiono, Yeager, and CB-23, the four confronted Leechee with San restraining him with a blaster. Under duress, Leechee told the group that Kev was being held inside Tagrin's starship Dalkor Dagger at the spaceport. Prior to leaving, San shot his comlink to prevent him from warning the bounty hunter.\nXiono, Yeager and CB-23 boarded Tagrin's ship and found Kev. However, they were trapped by the wily bounty hunter who departed the spaceport, intending to rendezvous with the First Order. Synara followed her friends in a speeder bike. San's friends manage to damage the Tagrin's starship, causing to crash on the outskirts of Vargo Spaceport. San and Yeager fought against Tagrin but the bounty hunter proved a formidable opponent. Xiono and CB-23 took the opportunity to escape.\nTagrin subsequently captured Synara, Xiono, and CB-23 and brought them before Commander Pyre and First Order Security Bureau Agent Tierny. Tierny tortured San with electricity in an attempt to force Yeager to reveal the location of the Colossus. When Yeager objected, Tierny sought to play on his compassion for the pirate. Tierny then turned her attention to torturing Yeager in order to uncover the location of the Colossus.\nXiono and Kev managed to infiltrate the First Order's base disguised as stormtroopers. They freed Synara and Yeager while CB-23 managed to free herself. The five then returned to their Star Commuter 2000 shuttle but were ambushed by Tagrin. Following a struggle, they managed to escape but were pursued by First Order TIE fighters. The group were rescued by Ace Squadron who escorted them into space. Though they were pursued by Commander Pyre's Star Destroyer, San and her companions managed to escape into hyperspace aboard the Colossus.\nWhile Synara actively made friends and participated in helping the Colossus evade First Order capture, her fellow Warbird particularly Captain Kragan began to form feelings of animosity towards Captain Doza. During a trip off the Colossus Kragan purchased several B2-series super battle droids from Sidon Ithano, which he intended to use to take over the space station. In Kragan's absence, an unwary Synara tried to reason with Captain Doza, opining that his surveillance of the pirates would make them more likely to rebel against Doza's authority. Following Kragan's return, Doza placed the Colossus on lockdown.\nKnowing Synara's sympathy to the inhabitants of the Colossus, Kragan sent Synara into the Colossus marketplace to distribute the food that he had gathered during his trip outstation. In Synara's absence, Kragan enlisted a seemingly unwary Neeku Voxo into repairing the battle droids, claiming they were part of the station's new security detail. At Aunt Z's Tavern, San confided in Xiono about her suspicions about Kragan's motives in bringing the droid. Returning to Warbirds' hangar, the duo were captured by Kragan and the other Warbirds, who locked them into a makeshift cell with Vozo.\nBelieving that obstacles to his plan had been eliminated, Kragan initiated a mutiny, using the B-2 battle droids to take over the station and eliminate Captain Doza's security droids. However, Vozo had a back-up plan and used the reprogrammed B1-Series battle droid \"B1\" to free them from their cell. Synara accompanied her Colossus allies to the hangar where they confronted Kragan and his pirates, who were about to force Captain Doza and Yeager to walk into space. Under Vozo's orders, B1 ordered the B2 to disarm the pirates except Synara.\nFollowing the defeat of Kragan's mutiny, San convinced Captain Doza not to imprison her former pirate comrades in the station's brig but to banish them. In return for allowing them to leave, the pirates had to leave their weapons behind and the Galleon's hyperdrive was disabled. While Kragan was bitter that his adopted daughter had betrayed him, Synara countered that the Colossus had shown mercy. Following the pirates' departure, Captain Doza said that it must have been difficult for San to turn against her family. San responded that the inhabitants of the Colossus were her new family.\nSynara took part in the defense of the Colossus during the station's flight from Aeos Prime after the First Order discovered their presence.\nAfter the Colossus joined the Resistance, Synara attended a townhall meeting where Captain Doza informed the inhabitants of the space station about Xiono and Yeager's mission to rescue Tamara Ryvora, who had defected from the First Order. After Xiono and Ryvora gave a speech warning the Colossus that the First Order was coming for them, Aunt Z gave a speech urging the Colossus to help them. San voiced her support for Aunt Z's speech, saying that they should help their friends. Synara San, flying Kragan Gorr's shuttle, joined Commander Venisa Doza's Jade Squadron and Ace Squadron, in their attack against Commander Pyre's Star Destroyer. After CB-23 disabled the Star Destroyer's shields, Team Colossus managed to damaged the Destroyer's engines enough to cause their ship's destruction. Once Kazuda Xiono and his companions escaped from the Destroyer, Synara and the rest of the squadron returned to the Colossus.\nSynara San was a female Mirialan with black hair, blue eyes, green lips, and lavender skin. She had traditional Mirialan tattoos on her face, consisting of eight blue diamonds on her forehead and the bridge of her nose. She was technologically adept, which allowed her to get a job as a salvager while undercover on the Colossus.\nSan's time on the Colossus caused her to develop a friendship with a few of residents, particularly Kazuda Xiono, Tam Ryvora, and Torra Doza. Due to her new bonds, San struggled to balance her loyalty to Kragan Gorr with her new friends. Kragan grew concerned that Synara was choosing her friends over her loyalty to her fellow pirates and did not inform her fully about their operations. When she learned that the Warbird gang was plotting to kidnap Torra Doza, San secretly betrayed her allies to help rescue her.\nSynara's friendship with Kaz gained her a valuable ally who helped her to escape the First Order. Though Kaz had realized that Synara was a pirate, he still regarded her as a friend for helping to save the Colossus from the rokkna Bibo's mother and rescuing Torra Doza. Synara later returned Kaz's favor by convincing her fellow Warbirds to come to Xiono's aid when he instigated an uprising against the First Order on the Colossus.\nDue to her sense of honor, San chastised Snarl and Drell for abandoning Xiono and Torra on the icy world of Celsor 3 and forced them to apologize. As a peacemaker, San helped to calm Gork down when Xiono accidentally elbowed a cup into him. San's friendship with Kaz and other Colossus residents led her to side with the station's inhabitants during Kragan's attempted mutiny. As a gesture of mercy, she convinced Captain Doza to spare the pirates. San regarded the Colossus as her new family. She remained loyal to her new family during the Escape from Aeos Prime and Team Colossus' showdown against the First Order.\nSynara San was adopted by the Quarren pirate captain Kragan Gorr, who saved her from a life on the streets of Vanqor and raised her as his daughter. While initially loyal to Kragan, Synara came to question her loyalty after befriending several Colossus residents including her rescuer Kazuda Xiono and Tamara Ryvora.\nAs a pragmatist, San regarded Gorr's plan to hunt down a winged jakoosk in order to curry favor with Captain Doza as a \"fool's errand.\" San spoke up for Kragan and her fellow Warbirds when the Nikto engineer Nenavakasa Nalor, who was a First Order spy, tried to drive a wedge between them and the Colossus.\nAfter Kragan attempted a mutiny against Captain Doza, she joined forces with Xiono and Neeku Vozo to defeat the coup attempt. She convinced Doza to show mercy on Kragan and the Warbirds by exiling them from the Colossus. While Kragan was hurt by her \"betrayal,\" she considered exile an act of mercy and her debt to Kragan paid.\nSynara initially had an antagonistic relationship with Kazuda Xiono since they were on opposite sides during the Warbirds' raids on the Colossus. After Xiono helped rescue her from a freighter in Sector Six, she initially struck him but calmed down after he reassured her that he was a friend. While Synara was initially a pirate spy, she warmed up to Xiono after the two narrowly escaped Bibo's mother and managed to warn the Colossus about the enraged rokkna.\nAfter befriending Kaz and his friends, Synara experienced a moral dilemma when Kragan ordered her to kidnap Torra Doza. Despite helping the pirates, she warned Kaz, earning his friendship and trust. Though Kaz eventually figured out that she was a pirate, Xiono decided to help her because she was a friend who had helped save the Colossus during the Bibo incident and rescue Torra. Synara later returned Kaz's friendship by convincing the pirates to help the Colossus residents expel the First Order and escape into space.\nDue to their friendship and trust, Xiono confided in Synara about the Colossus's dwindling supplies of food and fuel. She was able to use her position as an intermediary between Kaz and the pirates to convince her fellow Warbirds to help the Colossus residents to extract a coaxium canister from the First Order dreadnought Fulminatrix. Synara also confronted Xiono for trying to contact Tam, who had defected to the First Order. While Kaz still held out hope for his friend, Synara believed that Tam could not be trusted.\nWhen the First Order spy Nena attempted to drive a wedge between the Warbirds and the Colossus residents, Synara managed to convince Xiono of the pirates' innocence by emphasizing her role in selecting the station's power couplings. She also managed to convince Xiono and Neeku of Nena's ulterior motives.\nDue to Xiono's friendship, San ultimately chose to side with the inhabitants of the Colossus over the Warbirds during Kragan's attempted mutiny. She tried to warn Xiono about her suspicions of Kragan's new contingent of B-2 battle droids. After escaping capitavity with the help of Vozo's reprogrammed battle droid B1, she along with Xiono, Vozo and B-1 confronted Kragan, forcing the pirates to surrender after taking over their B-2 battle droids.\nSynara developed a budding friendship with the mechanic Tamara Ryvora. Synara impressed Tam by obtaining a CoMar Tri-Tracker chip, which Team Fireball needed for repairing the Colossus' air defense system. Tam trusted Synara enough to confide in her about her ambition of becoming a successful racer. The two became friends after working together to fight off several pirates in the Colossus' loading docks. Tam was upset when Synara left without saying goodbye after the First Order occupied the Colossus, not realizing that Synara was a pirate who was wanted by the First Order.\nSynara San was a competent pilot. She was also a skilled fighter who could hold herself well in physical combat. In addition, Synara was also a skilled sniper. Besides her occupation as a pirate, Synara was a resourceful salvager who could also pilot a salvaging skiff.\nSynara was also familiar with electronic systems such as power couplings. This allowed her to see through the First Order spy Nena's plot to drive a wedge between the Warbirds and the Colossus residents.\nDue to her combat skills, Xiono and Yeager enlisted her help during a mission to rescue Resistance spy Norath Kev. Despite her fighting skills, she found a match in the bounty hunter Ax Tagrin, who managed to capture her and Yeager following a crash landing and fierce fight.\nSynara San is a character created and developed for Star Wars Resistance. She is voiced by Nazneen Contractor. Earlier designs of Synara depicted her as a Weequay as well as a green-skinned Mirialan, before settling on the latter species but changing her skin color.",
