 "content": "A human male lived on the planet Lothal during the last years of the Galactic Republic's reign, and witnessed the organization transform into the Galactic Empire. On Lothal, he married and had two daughters, Moreena Krai and her younger sister, with whom he lived on his farm. When Moreena was fourteen, the Empire condemned her father's farm and took it so that they could extend their mining operations on Lothal. The Krais then left Lothal and moved to stay with Moreena's grandmother on the planet Alderaan. As the family waited for their transport offworld in Capital City spaceport, Moreena spotted Ezra Bridger, a friend of hers, and called him over to say goodbye. The pair spoke for a while before Moreena's father called her back, as the transport was about to leave.\nMoreena Krai's father first appeared, but was not named, in Ezra's Gamble, a junior novel written by Ryder Windham and released in 2014.",
