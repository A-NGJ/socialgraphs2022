 "content": "Bant Eerin's Padawan was a male Human Jedi Padawan. He served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nIn a galaxy of ever-changing possibilities, the fate of this young Padawan rested directly on his choices, ranging from becoming the hero of the Battle of Akoshissss to dying an ignominious death at the hands of a bounty hunter or becoming a slave in the Spice Mines of Kessel.\nA Force-sensitive Human, he was educated in the ways of the Force at the Jedi Order's Temple academy at Coruscant. As an Initiate at the academy, he befriended a young Iridonian Zabrak named Jaylen Kos, as well as Initiate Ahsoka Tano. Wielding a green-bladed Lightsaber, he remained at the Temple when the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nAs the war taxed the numbers of the Jedi Order, the Jedi High Council decided to speed up the rate at which apprentices were being trained. Approached by Grand Master Yoda, the Human Initiate was dispatched to the planet Kashyyyk where he would find his new Jedi Master awaiting him. After meeting Master Bant Eerin, the newly christened Commander took up his rank in the Grand Army of the Republic and led clone troopers to infiltrate the compound of Bitt Panith during the battle on Akoshissss. The Padawan was initially unaware of his being followed by Initiate Kos and an astromech droid, R3-G0, who would later come into the Jedi's possession. Jaylen Kos, R3-G0, and a clone trooper named Lex were dispatched to deal with Panith's genetically engineered cyborg Krossen during the operation.\nThe unidentified Padawan wields a green lightsaber.\nThis unidentified Padawan only appeared in The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Way of the Jedi, a book styled after the pattern of the Choose Your Own Adventures series of books. The character is intended to represent the reader who, after a brief introductory story, must begin making decisions in order to advance the story, turning to different pages based on the choices made. In all, there were 26 possible fates that could be met by this Padawan, some resulting in his being a hero, some resulting in grave consequences for the future of him and those around him, and some that ultimately seemed neither good nor bad on face, but were merely the result of a troubling conflict such as the Clone Wars. The story described in the above biography is merely one numerous possible fates for this character.",
