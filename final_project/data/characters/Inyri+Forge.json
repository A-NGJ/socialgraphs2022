 "content": "Inyri Forge was a Human female from Kessel. The younger sister of former Rogue Lujayne Forge, Inyri joined Rogue Squadron shortly after the conquest of Coruscant.\nThe Human female Inyri Forge was born on Kessel to Kassar and Myda Forge. Kassar was a teacher who volunteered to go to Kessel under a Galactic Republic program to educate inmates on how to re-enter society upon release. Her mother was one of the inmate students who fell in love with him and decided to stay with him on Kessel.\nInyri Forge had multiple brothers and sisters, including Lujayne, all of whom were still alive and living on Kessel in 6.5 ABY. Lujayne became a member of the New Republic's reorganized Rogue Squadron in that year, but she was killed by Imperial stormtoopers during a raid on the Rogues' Talasea base. In 7 ABY, while the New Republic Provisional Council was planning a strike at the Imperial capital of Coruscant, they decided to release some high profile prisoners in order to cause chaos in the heart of Imperial City.\nOne of those prisoners was Zekka Thyne, of the Black Sun organization. Along with Zekka came Forge, his \"glitterstim cutter\" and lover. Forge, being born on Kessel, and not sent there, was not a criminal, but she was insistent on staying with Thyne, even when the squadron offered to aid her. However, things changed as the undercover mission progressed. Forge began to rethink her loyalty towards Thyne, especially after an incident when they came under fire, and he ran to save himself while Rogue Squadron member Gavin Darklighter came to her aid.\nFinally, things came to a head when Thyne attempted to kill the Rogue Corran Horn, whom he blamed for putting him on Kessel in the first place. Forge shot and killed Thyne before he could go through with it. Having proven herself, Forge aided the Rogues during the Liberation of Coruscant, and she was inducted formally into the squadron in the celebration afterwards. Although she was a political appointee, Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles would have been happy to recruit her anyway.\nForge remained with the Rogues for years afterward, participating in the Bacta War, the Hunt for Zsinj, and the Ciutric campaign. During the latter operation, she was a member of Requiem Squadron where she was disguised as \"Inyon Fass,\" who had bright red hair and was the sister of Teekon Fass.\nLater she achieved the rank of Major during the Caamas Document Crisis, and continued to serve with the squadron well into the Yuuzhan Vong War, fighting in the Battle of Dantooine and the Battle of Kalarba. Under Rogue Leader Gavin Darklighter, she flew as Rogue Five, the leader of Two Flight. Retired by 43 ABY, she joined a group of friends in that year on a mission to save the Calrissian-Nunb Mines on Kessel from a series of destructive groundquakes.",
