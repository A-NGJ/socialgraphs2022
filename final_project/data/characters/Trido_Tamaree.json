 "content": "Trido Tamaree was a Togruta who was the commander of the Royal Togruta Fleet around 231 BBY. Tamaree took part in repelling the Nihil Attack on Valo. When the Royal Togruta Fleet intervened in the battle, Tamaree addressed a message to all participants in the battle, calling on all enemy ships to abandon the battle, stating the address was a final warning and announced that the Togruta would show no mercy. Tamaree was greeted by Jedi Knight Indeera Stokes, who requested that the Nihil be blown out of the sky.\nTrido Tamaree appeared in the novel The High Republic: The Rising Storm, which was written by Cavan Scott and published in 2021.",
