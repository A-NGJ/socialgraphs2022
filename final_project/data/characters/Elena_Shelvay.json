 "content": "Elena Shelvay was an Imperial Security Bureau operative and sister of Corwin Shelvay.\nAfter the murder of the Shelvay family at the hands of High Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne, Elena was kidnapped and re-educated by the ISB. As a result of her re-education she was brainwashed to believe her brother was to blame for her family's murder due to his Jedi teaching. She became emotionally unstable as a result, but regardless of this, she was a competent and dedicated ISB agent. Her loyalty to the Empire saw her rapid ascension through the Imperial hierarchy, and she eventually became the aide of Moff Abran Balfour.",
