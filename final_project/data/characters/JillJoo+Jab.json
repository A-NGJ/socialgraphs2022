 "content": "JillJoo Jab was a female Twi'lek waitress who worked in the Mos Espa cantina during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\nWhile serving in a Mos Zabu cantina, she helped the nerf herder Domo Jones, the protocol droid UR-1 and the Bith musician Blerx sabotage an Imperial purchase of proton torpedoes.\nLater, during 1 ABY, she became involved in a plot to help slaves escape Tatooine. While in the Mos Espa cantina, she encountered a spacer willing to help her with her mission. JillJoo learned that a Twi'lek slave named Sadelli escaped before being shipped off to Nal Hutta. She tasked the spacer with finding her and bringing her back to Mos Espa, so that she could be sent safely offworld. JillJoo encouraged the spacer by offering credits for successfully carrying out her tasks. The space agreed, and went out to find Sadellli. Though the spacer was ambushed by two thugs, they were dispatched, and the escaped slave was safely brought back to the city.\nHowever, Sadelli would not leave Tatooine without her younger sister, Soolami. JillJoo informed the spacer who had helped her before that Jabba Desilijic Tiure wanted Soolami at his side. She also learned that the gang of slavers responsible for all this activity was led by an individual named Woff B'tar, whom she described as a horrible man. The spacer agreed to once again help JillJoo, and sought out to find Soolami. Once again, the spacer was attacked, this time by a thug and a Trandoshan slaver. Fortunately, Soolami was brought back to Mos Espa, so that both she and her sister could leave the planet.\nHowever, JillJoo had one final task for the spacer. She managed to find the whereabouts of the slaver Woff B'tar. He was traveling to Jabba's Palace to explain the shortage of slaves caused by the spacer's actions. She told the spacer that if he could intercept and \"convince\" Woff that the slaving business was not tolerated, she would be forever in the spacer's debt. Fortunately for her, and perhaps the spacer, the spacer agreed to find and kill Woff. JillJoo was happy to hear this, but warned the spacer that killing Woff and his gang could attract the attention of the local authorities. She suggest that the spacer leave immediately after carrying out the task. Fortunately for JillJoo, the spacer once again failed to let her down. The spacer managed to kill B'tar, the Trandoshan, and two cronies who were escorting him. When the spacer returned, JillJoo was quite thankful, and claimed that the galaxy needed more heroes like the spacer who had helped her. Though she gave yet another, greater reward for the spacer's efforts, she admitted that it was not much, because the slave liberation was only funded by the donations of concerned citizens.\nJillJoo Jab first appeared in the comic \"Nerf Herder\". However, she later appeared as a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, players may perform a series of quests for her which involve rescuing Sadelli, and her sister Soolami, and killing the slavemaster named Woff B'tar.",
