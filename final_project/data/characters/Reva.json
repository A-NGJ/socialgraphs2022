 "content": "Reva was a female Twi'lek who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. She was born on the planet Cularin, and lived on the world for all her life. During the Clone Wars, the Thaereian military was driven out of the Cularin system, and Cularin became a full voting member of the Galactic Republic. In the aftermath of the transfer of power, Reva attended a rally in the city Gadrin that had been organized by the Humans Nia Reston and San Herrera, and she voiced her opinion on the changeover, stating that she believed Cularin did not need Thaere and that it did not need the Republic Senate. A Gungan subsequently spoke in support of Reva's claim.",
