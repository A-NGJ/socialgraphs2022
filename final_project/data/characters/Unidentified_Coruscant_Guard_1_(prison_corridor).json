 "content": "A clone served as a shock trooper with Coruscant Guard during the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists. He was stationed at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center in Galactic City on Coruscant.\nAround 21 BBY, when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised himself as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and infiltrated the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center to uncover a plot to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, this clone trooper was on guard in the detention facility along with many other clone shock trooper guards.\nAfter the undercover Jedi became involved in a fight with fellow prisoner Boba Fett, the clone shock trooper guards tried to intervene but the prisoners seized the moment and attacked them and a prison riot ensued. During the fight, a reinforcements squadron of clone troopers arrived from an outside corridor, but they were quickly overpowered and the prisoners managed to escape through the open door. This trooper, along with a fellow one, were also stationed inside the corridors and helped stun the prisoners that came their way, until they received orders to turn their weapons off stun and kill the prisoners if they became too violent.\nThe clone first appeared in the fifteenth episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' fourth season, titled \"Deception\". He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, the actor who portrays all of the clone troopers in the series.",
