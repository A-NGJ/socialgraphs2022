 "content": "A human male pilot served in the Resistance fleet during their war against the First Order and held the military rank of captain. In the year 34 ABY, during the Battle of Oetchi, he piloted the Nebulon-C escort frigate Anodyne. Attempting to flee from the First Order with the other Resistance ships, this pilot's ship was the first to run dry. The ship was then destroyed as General Armitage Hux commented that the ship was the beginning of the end of the Resistance. This pilot elected to remain behind on the Anodyne whilst the rest of the crew evacuated. He informed Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo of this development and wished them good luck just as the ship was completely destroyed, killing him.\nThe character was played by Danny Sapani in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. The pilot had a Resistance rank badge that denoted him as a captain.",
