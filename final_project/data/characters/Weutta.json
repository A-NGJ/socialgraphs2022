 "content": "Weutta was the Head of Security on Phindar approximately 42 BBY. He was responsible for dealing with rebels against Baftu and Terra Derida's rule of Phindar and after a state of emergency was declared on the planet he brought all rebels before Baftu.\nWeutta interrogated Obi-Wan Kenobi after he was arrested for impersonating a guard, not knowing the thirteen-year-old was a Jedi. He used a Force-pike on Obi-Wan and tried to extract information from him about other rebels on the planet. Obi-Wan didn't answer and Weutta brought him before Baftu. Weutta was rather pudgy and rough with his prisoners, but was quite nervous around Baftu.",
