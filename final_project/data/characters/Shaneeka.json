 "content": "Shaneeka was a female Chiss engineer. Sometime following 0 BBY, she was the chief engineer of the hidden township of Aurilia on Dathomir. As many of her predecessors in this job had died prematurely during attacks on the village, she was always very busy repairing and maintaining the town's shield generator.\nThe Mon Calamari Quharek helped her maintain most of the electronics and machinery in Aurilia.\nShaneeka was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. She could be found next to the town's shield generator, and was not involved any of the game's quests.\nShaneeka was added to the game with Chapter 7 in November 2007, along with the rest of the new township of Aurilia.",
