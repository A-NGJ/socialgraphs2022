 "content": "Twylope Nur was a Mohsenian male who served the Resistance as a field medic. He used his ability to smell illness and injury, alongside his natural resistance and defenses, to diagnose his patients and quickly deliver appropriate treatment. He was part of the Resistance group that set up base on the moon Ajan Kloss and was present when the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon returned ablaze from a mission to Sinta Glacier Colony.\nTwylope Nur was a Mohsenian male who served the Resistance as a field medic during their war against the First Order. He was part of the core Resistance group that set up base on the jungle moon of Ajan Kloss under the command of General Leia Organa.\nIn 35 ABY, he was present in the base when the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon returned from a mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony. The starship was heavily damaged and on fire, and Nur was amongst the Resistance personnel who rushed forward to aid in putting out the flames and helping the crew. While the others were tending to the fire, Nur was knelt down in front of the vessel attending to something on the ground.\nFollowing Organa's death, Nur later attended a meeting at the base led by Generals Poe Dameron and Finn, who laid out a plan to attack the forces of the First Order and Sith Eternal on the planet Exegol. The Resistance ultimately emerged victorious with aid from allies from around the galaxy, and following the battle Nur took part in celebrations held on Ajan Kloss, jumping up and down amidst the crowds of joyous allies.\nNur was an amiable individual and was well suited to his role as a medic due to the fact he could smell illness, injury and the bodies natural defenses fighting against them using the sensitive olfactory receptors that lined his long snout. This allowed him to diagnose patients quickly and accurately then administer appropriate treatments. He had large black eyes, white fur and cream skin.\nNur wore a brown tunic over a white shirt and a brown belt.\nTwylope Nur was created for the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo. Concept art of Nur titled \"Wizard 43\" was created by creature concept designer and senior sculptor Luke Fisher for the film. Twylope Nur was played by puppeteer and creature performer Mohsen Nouri, whose name was also used as inspiration for Twylope's species - Mohsenian.",
