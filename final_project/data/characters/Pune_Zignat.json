 "content": "Pune Zignat was a male Aqualish who served as a weapons technician for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the defense of Maridun, Zignat worked under General Lok Durd as he was testing the new Defoliator Deployment Tank.\nPune Zignat was an Aqualish who worked for the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a weapons technician working for the Neimoidian General Lok Durd. He was responsible for aiding Durd in the testing of his prototype Defoliator Deployment Tank on the primitive world Maridun.\nZignat activated the weapon for its first test fire, as Durd wanted to demonstrate the weapon's efficiency to Count Dooku. After the Battle of Maridun, a conflict between Durd's Droid forces and the small resistance of the local Lurmen colony, aided by the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Aayla Secura, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain Rex and Commander Bly.\nIn the wake of Durd's defeat, both he and Zignat were arrested by Republic forces.\nThe character model used for Pune Zignat was first seen in Ziro's Palace in the feature film that debuted the series on August 15, 2008. He was sitting next to the character model used for Silood. Subsequently, the same model used for Zignat made several more background appearances during the series.",
