 "content": "Barlin Fugar was a male Sullustan, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nFugar was a member of the Intarsa League, a criminal organization that operated in the Cularin system. When the League captured the Blue Star Centre, on Cularin, in about 31 BBY, Fugar took up a defensive position in one of the Centre's office buildings. He believed that he and his fellow criminals were in a dangerous situation, which could only resolved by a show of force. He also thought that the situation had been caused by Dersa Welles, the leader of the League, and Corkash Fenc, a Rodian soldier, who were not doing their jobs properly.",
