 "content": "Deeng was a Rodian henchman that worked for Jabba Desilijic Tiure on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nDeeng was a violent Rodian thug, rumored to have murdered his very own mother.\nPrior to the Battle of Yavin, a slave revolt took place in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine. In 1 ABY, Drik Bandrik, a slaver who became upset at Kitster Banai for his persistent attempts to improve the lives of slaves, framed him with organizing the revolt at the palace. Though Kitster was in fact innocent of the accusations, Jabba believed Drik Bandrik, and sent Deeng to kill Kitster. Kitster's life was at stake, but thanks to a spacer who agreed to help him, Deeng was found and killed before he could reach Mos Espa.\nDeeng was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for Kitster in Mos Espa had to hunt down and kill Deeng outside the city.",
