 "content": "Fenn Signis was a male Human from Alderaan who served as a Rebel trooper during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. After Alderaan's destruction, he joined Alliance Special Forces .\nA native of Alderaan, Fenn Signis joined the Rebellion at the age of seventeen and became an exemplary soldier in the Alliance Military. After completing two tours of duty with the Alliance Army, Signis was stationed at the Rebel base on Arda I when he learned of his homeworld's destruction at the hands of the Empire. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the Rebels abandoned the Arda I base and Signis joined Alliance Special Forces vowing to avenge his lost homeworld and bring an end to the Empire's reign of terror.\nSignis was a dedicated soldier loyal to the Rebel Alliance. He was a weapons expert, and was as dangerous working alone as he was working with a squad of SpecForces commandos. He possessed a knack for gaining an advantageous position over his enemies, making him a very dangerous opponent.",
