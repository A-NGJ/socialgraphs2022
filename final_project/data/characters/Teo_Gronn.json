 "content": "Teo Gronn was a male Duros Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA male Duros born on the planet of Coruscant, Teo Gronn was quickly identified as a Force-sensitive and sent to the Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force. Graduating from the Temple's academy after just over a decade of study, Gronn was chosen to become the Padawan of Jedi Master Lyron, a fellow Duros. Accompanying Lyron on a few missions, their fellowship was short-lived as Master Lyron participated and died in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nStationed at the Temple, an orphaned Gronn was quickly reassigned to Master Oshi-Jid and was appointed the rank of Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic. Gronn was again quickly robbed of his teacher when Oshi-Jid perished during the fighting on Muunilinst, sending him back to the Temple to await reassignment. With no available masters, the Jedi High Council was forced to send Gronn on a mission with other Padawans whose masters had been killed. Led by Grand Master Yoda and Master Ulseh, Gronn fought in the battle of Argul alongside his fellow Padawans. While Ulseh was killed and Yoda retreated for reinforcements, Gronn and the other apprentices held off Confederate Commander Drogen Hosh long enough for the Grand Master to return, turning the battle into a victory for the Republic.\nTeo Gronn made his only appearance in Only the Force, a scenario for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In that, the player playing as Gronn can choose Gronn's sex. However, he is described as male in the biographies of the other playable characters, so that can be assumed to be his canonical sex.",
