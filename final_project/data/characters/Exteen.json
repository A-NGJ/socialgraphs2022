 "content": "Exteen was a Zabrak Jedi Knight who served both the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi starfighter pilot and later as an officer in the Republic Navy during the Cold War and Galactic War with the Sith Empire.\nA Zabrak male, Exteen arrived on the Jedi Order's homeworld of Tython in 3643 BBY to take the Jedi Trials the day the crisis surrounding the long-lost Fount of Rajivari ended. By the time the Sith Lord Darth Angral attacked Tython several months later, Exteen had become a Jedi Knight, and he flew a starfighter alongside other members of the Order in bombing runs against Angral's cruiser Oppressor after the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din defeated Angral in battle.\nAfter studying the exploits of military units such as the Republic Special Forces Division's Havoc Squad, Exteen was one of several Jedi who volunteered for Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh's new program to integrate the Jedi Order and the Republic Military in the aftermath of the successful Battle of Corellia when Galactic War broke out with the Sith Empire. Exteen soon achieved the rank of Captain and became the commanding officer of the Republic cruiser Vanguard's Blade, which participated in the second battle for control of the baradium-laced planet of Denova.",
