 "content": "Ganga Lor was a male Chevin crime lord residing on Sel Zonn Station, an XQ2 Platform space station that orbited the Core Worlds planet of Brentaal IV. Lor was a longtime enemy of the protocol droid crime lord Switch, who had arrived at Sel Zonn Station at the same time as Lor.\nAt some point during the years following the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of Palpatine's Galactic Empire, Ganga Lor discovered Switch negotiating with some spacers in Deep Storage Bay V14 for an Alderaanian Resistance agent frozen in carbonite. Angry that he had been left out, he ordered his men to open fire on Switch and the spacers.\nSwitch's thugs and bounty hunters had been paid before not to shoot Ganga Lor's thugs. During the fight, Switch's thugs turned on him and began fighting with Ganga Lor. However, the spacers were able to dispatch the turncoats, and Switch was protected.\nSwitch survived the fight, though Ganga Lor did not.",
