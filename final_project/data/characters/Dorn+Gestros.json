 "content": "Dorn Gestros was a Human male who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Dorn Gestros was involved in Jabba the Hutt's plot to take control of Mos Eisley. The plan was to incite the Tusken Raiders to attack Mos Eisley in order to pressurize the mayor and eventually take control of the city. In 1 ABY, Dorn Gestros frequented the cantina in the city of Mos Espa. During this time, a Twi'lek named Anetia Kah'ryn tasked an entertainer with extracting information from a number of patrons, including Dorn Gestros. Anetia, a performer herself, found that patrons were more willing to divulge information after they have been entertained. Anetia desired information on criminal and Tusken activity on Tatooine, and felt Dorn Gestros might know something. A novice entertainer went to the Mos Espa cantina and performed for Gestros and other patrons. After the performance, Gestros complimented the entertainer. The entertainer used this opportunity to flatter Gestros, and ask him if he knew of any information. Gestros then revealed that someone was riling up the Tuskens, and that some sort of holy site was involved. The entertainer thanked Gestros for the information, and after saying their farewells, reported the information to Anetia.\nDorn Gestros was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Dorn Gestros was added to the game with the release of the with the \"Publish 17\", on May 26, 2005. He was part of a quest given by Anetia Kah'ryn to beginner players who had chosen a career of \"entertainer\". During each server reset, his appearance was randomized, but he consistently appeared as a Human male. Anetia Kah'ryn's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005,",
