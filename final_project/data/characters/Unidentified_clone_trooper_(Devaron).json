 "content": "This clone trooper was stationed on Devaron during the Clone Wars. He served under the command of Jedi General Bolla Ropal, Jedi Commander Tyzen Xebec and Commander Ganch constructing fortifications for non-military purposes. When the Devaron outpost was attacked by a task force led by Cad Bane, he survived long enough to report the abduction of Master Ropal and his holocron memory crystal before being killed by enemy battle droids.\nHe and his fellow clone troopers were assigned to help build non-military fortifications on the Devaronian homeworld under the leadership of Jedi Master Bolla Ropal. Around 21 BBY, bounty hunter Cad Bane launched a surprise attack with a Separatist task force on loan from Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation. When General Anakin Skywalker arrived aboard Resolute to render assistance, he reported that the Republic outpost had been overrun and Master Ropal had been captured by the enemy forces. While still offering his report, he was killed when his position was overrun.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett this clone stood at 1.83 Imperial standard meter.\nThis trooper utilized white Phase I clone trooper armor and a standard DC-15S.\nIn the episode, the clone was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series.",
