 "content": "Ottilie was a human female who worked as a server for guests on board Crimson Dawn crime lord Dryden Vos's yacht, First Light. In 10 BBY, she was serving at a party on the yacht when the starship arrived on the planet Vandor. During the party, Vos's advisor Qi'ra took two of the glasses of quanya from Ottilie's tray and thanked the server.\nOttilie was a human female who worked as a chic server on board the First Light, the personal yacht of crime lord Dryden Vos, head of the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. In 10 BBY, she served Vos's personal guests at a party on the yacht as it arrived at the planet Vandor. As criminals Tobias Beckett, Han Solo, and Chewbacca arrived via turbolift to the starship's viewing platform, Ottilie carried a tray of drinks past her colleague Margo, who then greeted the trio.\nThe server was later carrying a tray with three glasses of quanya reserve intended for Count Chrodber of Serenno, but Vos's advisor Qi'ra took two glasses from the tray as Ottilie strolled past. After passing one on to Solo, Qi'ra thanked Ottilie, asking if the server had been attentive to Dok-Ondar, an Ithorian antiques dealer. Ottilie confirmed she had been very attentive and then left the pair, heading off into the crowd with her one remaining glass.\nOttilie was efficient, observant, and showed just enough initiative to work independently, but not enough to worry her bosses. She was a tall woman with black hair, brown eyes, and light skin.\nWhile on board the First Light, Ottilie wore a black dress with silver sequins and a gold necklace, earrings, and bracelets.\nOttilie was portrayed by Samantha Colley in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology Series film, Solo: A Star Wars Story.",
