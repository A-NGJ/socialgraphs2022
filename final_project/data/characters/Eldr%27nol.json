 "content": "Eldr'nol was a male Stereb, who lived on the planet Prakith during the early years of the Galactic Empire.\nEldr'nol lived with his Stereb tribe in the cave systems beneath the surface of Prakith, and he and his followers were responsible for fulfilling the tribe's logistical needs. In c. 17 BBY, a group of Alderaanian Resistance agents encountered Eldr'nol on Prakith, and he showed them a map of the Prakith cave systems. When the agents eventually left, Eldr'nol was sad to see them go, but he hoped that they would find what they sought.",
