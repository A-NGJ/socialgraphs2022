 "content": "Ramil was a Serennian male, the son of Count Gora and Countess Anya of Serenno, and the older brother of Dooku and Jenza. At one point, Ramil was grievously injured during a racing competition he participated in, only saved by timely intervention of his brother, the Jedi Master Dooku, but was forced to wear a life-preserving suit of armor as a result of the incident. Eventually, Ramil became the Count of Serenno, succeeding his father Gora, hoping he could turn the people against the Galactic Republic through manipulation with the help of a group of Abyssin pirates that he hired. However, his efforts to do so failed when he battled his brother, and Ramil was defeated and killed aboard his ship by Dooku. Dooku then replaced him as the Count of Serenno and as the head of its ruling house, House Serenno.\nRamil first appeared in the audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott.",
