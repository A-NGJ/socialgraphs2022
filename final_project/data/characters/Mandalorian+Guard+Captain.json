 "content": "The Mandalorian Guard Captain was a Mandalorian of clan Ordo. He could be found guarding the entrance to the Neo-Crusader compound on Dxun. When Meetra Surik was trying to get transport to Onderon from Mandalore the Preserver, she had to gain his trust by completing a series of quests. The Mandalorian Captain offered Surik one of these quests, which was to kill the great Zakkeg and bring its ear back to him as proof.\nIn Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, if the player character has received the quest from the Mandalorian Captain about killing the Zakkeg, and if he or she has beaten Davrel in the Mandalorian Battle Circle, Davrel will try to regain his honor by attempting to kill Surik. The player can persuade Davrel to help kill the Zakkeg.",
