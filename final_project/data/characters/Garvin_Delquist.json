 "content": "Garvin Delquist was a male Human who lived on Almas during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDelquist worked as a researcher at the Forard research station, where he was part of a team studying the kaluthin, a plant created by Darth Rivan to make Almas habitable. While he was there, he began to secretly fall in love with Misha Quor-Din, a Padawan at the Almas Academy. In circa 31 BBY, something began killing the kaluthin and Delquist traveled to the Almas Sith fortress to search for any clues about why this was happening. However, he instead found a Sith amulet, which placed him under the influence of the dark side of the Force.\nBased in the fortress, Delquist gathered a group of Dark Jedi followers from among the Believers, a Sith cult that operated on Almas. He had them capture Misha Quor-Din and bring her back to the fortress. However, she did not reciprocate the feelings he had for her, pushing him further under the influence of the dark side.",
