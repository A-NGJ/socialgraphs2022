With Koyo opened the doors to the workshop, triggering a defensive reaction of the home droid WeeGee. The commandos neutralized it with an antipersonnel grenade, and then Santo muted it by putting a beam through its speaker grill.\nAs at that time their target was out, Morgan witnessed the intrusion safely from afar.
