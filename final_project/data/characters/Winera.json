 "content": "Winera was a Princess of Daimar. Her mother, Erra was of the Lamont Dynasty of Daimar and her grandfather was Mitar, the king of Daimar during the last years of the Galactic Republic.\nWinera was a Human female who was born into the Lamont Dynasty of Daimar, the royal house of the planet Daimar, during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Winera was the daughter of Princess Erra and the granddaughter of Mitar, Daimar's king.\nShortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, the Empire established a blockade around Daimar. Concerned for Wilena's wellbeing and determined to prevent her from being captured by the Imperial forces or starving due the impact of the blockade, King Mitar sent Winera, along with Senator Alet Komain and the Jedi Shen-Ji Collun to seek out Winera's uncle Prince Torrin, who operated an anti-Imperial resistance group on the planet Byrsym.",
