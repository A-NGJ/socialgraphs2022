 "content": "Garven Meccamitta was a male Human doctor of noble heritage who was known for his medical genius. He was the chief surgeon and dean of the Rhinnal State Medical Academy located in Rhire on the planet of Rhinnal. He was tall for a Human and towered over his subordinates both in stature and achievement. He had little patience with others and tended to roll his eyes when asked a question. Meccamitta tended to dress in a clean white surgeon's outfit at all times as a mark of his professionalism. He was very strict about enforcing quarantines.",
