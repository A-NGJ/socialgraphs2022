 "content": "Lalo was a Twi'lek assassin who lived in Tolea Biqua on Genarius. Her cover was that of a masseuse who was sent as a gift to her targets. Unlike some other masseuses in Tolea Biqua, her services were limited to the massage, but she was very skilled at it, and often left her client unconscious. She also offered needle-based therapy, and it was these needles which were her weapon of choice when her clients were actually her targets.\nLalo had trained under one of Riboga the Hutt's lieutenants. Before Riboga left the system, he had that lieutenant killed, which freed Lalo to be a freelancer.\nIn Revelations, Lalo's name is misspelled as Lola.",
