 "content": "Kalend Thora was a smuggler who worked for Black Sun.\nThora started off as a weapons smuggler working for Kintan gunrunners. She later spent most of her time in Corellian space where she became renowned for her ability to escape capture. She was later assigned to the Sisar Run where she started working for Vigo Sprax.\nNotable features about Thora were a long scar across her head and her tendency to wear the same flight suit as A-wing pilots of the Rebel Alliance.\nShe began using a Kuat Drive Yards D9 Runner light freighter called the Starknife, when the ship's original owner, a fellow member of Black Sun, was ambushed and killed by an unknown party.",
