 "content": "Valss was a male Chiss who lived during the Galactic War. He was discovered to be Force-sensitive, which in the Chiss Ascendancy meant either exile or restraint from using the powers under penalty of death. Valss however was adopted by Syndic Zenta into the Inrokini family, who sheltered him on Copero where he continued to practice his skills. In 3630 BBY Zenta harbored a fugitive from the Eternal Alliance named Theron Shan on Copero and Valss joined Shan's cause, having experienced a vision of his victory. Together, they stole from Zenta the location of a holomap leading to a superweapon of the Sith Emperor Vitiate and traveled to it. Shan destroyed the holomap after learning the superweapon's location, but as they prepared to leave, the Alliance Commander and Raina Temple arrived to stop them. Valss stayed behind to buy Shan enough time to escape, and was eventually struck down.\nValss appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion as the final boss during the flashpoint \"A Traitor Among the Chiss\".",
