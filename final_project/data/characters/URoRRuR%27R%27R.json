 "content": "URoRRuR'R'R was a skilled Tusken Raider hunter who once attacked Luke Skywalker as the latter was trying to find R2-D2 in the Jundland Wastes.\nA Tusken leader, URoRRuR'R'R was very adept at marksmanship and hunting, and also excellent in hand-to-hand combat with the traditional gaderffii. Unlike most Tuskens, he was not intimidated by machines and had no fear of approaching them. He acquired his hunting rifle, an important status symbol in Tusken culture, by scavenging it from the wreckage of a downed starship near Anchorhead. His group raided moisture farms for water and parts and roamed the Jundland Wastes, preying on unsuspecting travelers.\nAfter Luke Skywalker had C-3PO stop his landspeeder, and as they searched for the errant astromech droid R2-D2, URoRRuR'R'R sprung upon Luke with a vicious bellow, knocking the youth unconscious. As URoRRuR'R'R and his followers were beginning to strip Skywalker's vehicle for parts, Obi-Wan Kenobi showed up, expertly mimicking the call of a krayt dragon. As intended, this unsettled the Tuskens and caused them to flee the scene. However, as Kenobi warned his soon-to-be apprentice Luke, the Sand People would not remain cowed for very long.\nURoRRuR'R'R was played by stunt coordinator Peter Diamond, who was the only stunt person on location in Tunisia. As shown in the documentary Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, Diamond actually only held aloft his gaffi stick once. Editors Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew rewound and repeated this shot several times to make it seem as if he rocked it back and forth in triumph. The famous bellow was then added by Ben Burtt, fashioned from donkey brays.",
