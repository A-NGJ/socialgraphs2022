 "content": "Orla Defra was a female Human who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring the Clone Wars, Defra lived in the platform city Soboll on Cularin and worked as a lab technician as part of a Thaereian military research team. She was an informer for the Cularin Militia and she was able to provide them with technical readouts about Soboll and Thaereian research. After the Thaereian military withdrew all their forces to Soboll, Major Xirossk of the Militia sent the Heroes of Cularin to find out from Defra the location of the Thaereian commander, Kurth San. However, before they could meet with her, Defra was arrested by the Thaereians.",
