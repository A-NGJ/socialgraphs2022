 "content": "A Yuuzhan Vong domain of the priest caste was led by the High Priest Jakan in 25 ABY during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Members of the Yuuzhan Vong elite, the domain was very powerful due to its chief's position as advisor to Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane. Elan, the youngest daughter of Jakan and a Priestess of Yun-Harla undertook a mission to assassinate members of the New Jedi Order. Her success on the mission would have brought even greater prosperity to her domain. Although Elan died before she completed the mission, the domain remained influential and her father was elevated to even greater power.\nThis domain was first mentioned in the 2000 novel The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial written by James Luceno.",
