 "content": "A Gamorrean guard served under crime lords Jabba Desilijic Tiure and Bib Fortuna before the bounty hunter Boba Fett took over Jabba's Palace and established his own gotra. Sometime after the attack, the Gamorrean and a fellow guard were captured and brought before Fett. Refusing to torture the Gamorreans, Fett allowed them both to live as long as they pledged their loyalty to him.\nUnder Fett's service, the Gamorrean wore little in the way of armor, with only a single pauldron on the left shoulder, as opposed to their partner, who wore two pauldrons in addition to a metal helmet. He carried a small sword for melee combat. The two guards came to the aid of their leader when he was attacked by assassins of the Order of the Night Wind and later dragged Fett back to the bacta pod within his palace to heal after the skirmish. After Fett's right-hand Fennec Shand brought the sole-surviving assassin back to the palace, the Gamorrean held a blade to the man's throat on Fett's orders, but the crime lord chose to spare the man's life for a short while longer.\nLater, he participates with his comrade to the Battle for Mos Espa against the Pyke Syndicate and unfortunately they are killed by the Klatooinians when the three crime families betray Boba and join the Pykes. The Klatooinians pushed them of a cliff to theirs deaths.\nThe Gamorrean guard first appeared in \"Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land,\" the premiere episode of the television series The Book of Boba Fett, which released on Disney+ on December 29, 2021. The guard was played by U.S. Marine Collin Hymes. Although the Gamorreans on the show are virtually identical, Hymes stated on his Instagram that he portrayed the \"better looking\" one, clarifying that his character did not wear a helmet, as opposed to Frank Trigg's Gamorrean, which appears more heavily armored.",
