 "content": "Pex was a male Human who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as a public relations officer.\nBy the time of the Battle of Yavin, Commander Pex served as Chief Public Relations Officer of the Galactic Empire. During the Empire Day festivities of 1 ABY, he resided in a hotel at the city of Nashal on Talus. It was here that he instructed an Imperial spacer to visit an Imperial garrison historian on Rori, to help him collect data for a report he was writing. The mission eventually led the spacer to Darth Vader at Outpost GRF-7493 on Yavin 4.\nAn \"Imperial PR officer\" appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Imperial PR officer was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 19\", on June 29, 2005. During the 2005 Empire Day live event from June 29 to July 11, 2005, he could be found in Nashal and started a quest titled \"Happy Empire Day!,\" which would send players on an important mission throughout the galaxy. The web article \"Friday Feature - Empire Day\" on the official Star Wars Galaxies website introduced the Empire Day live event to players and clearly identified the \"Imperial PR officer\" from the game as \"Chief Public Relations Officer Commander Pex\". After the live event ended, Pex never reappeared in the game since the Empire Day event was discontinued until its complete overhaul in 2008.",
