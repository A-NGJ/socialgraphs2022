 "content": "Karina the Great was a Geonosian female who served as the queen of Geonosis and an ally of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. She reigned as the queen of the Stalgasin hive and Geonosis during the war. She died when she was buried alive due to the collapse of the Progate Temple.\nKarina ruled over Geonosis and her hive from beneath the Progate Temple with Archduke Poggle the Lesser acting as Geonosis' public leader. Karina laid many eggs and learned how to bring dead Geonosians back to life. She decided that she also wanted to control Jedi.\nIn 21 BBY, during the Second Battle of Geonosis, Karina was able to have her undead soldiers capture Jedi Master Luminara Unduli when Poggle the Lesser allowed her to follow him into the Progate Temple's catacombs. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker came to rescue her. Karina accused the Galactic Republic of attacking Geonosis and asked why they came before her.\nWhen Kenobi told that she must surrender to the Republic, Karina refused to do so saying that he cannot dictate her and that her empire will last forever. Kenobi then told her that she was incorrect and that she will submit to the Republic.\nKarina then grew angry and ordered her guards to execute them. Kenobi said that if she did that, then the Republic will grow harsher towards her. She still ordered them to execute them by telling Kenobi about her plans to use her children to control Unduli and the other Jedi. She then ordered her guards to get the brain worms and put it in Luminara. However, then Kenobi ordered his clones to attack. Karina was blinded by Commander Cody's troopers, who shined their flashlights in her face. As the Jedi made their escape and took Poggle prisoner, Karina was buried alive when the Progate Temple collapsed.\nKarina the Great had red and black eyes and tan skin. As the leader of her people, she stayed safely underground while Poggle publicly led them. Since she lived underground, she was not used to bright lights and was disoriented when the clones shone their flashlights on her.\nKarina was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who also voices all of the clone troopers in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series.\n\"Legacy of Terror\" is notable for containing several similarities to the 1986 movie Aliens: Just like the alien queen from the science fiction film, Karina the Great is the leader of a hive of aliens and lays eggs, and her giant egg sac and the fan-shaped growth on top of her head, look strikingly similar to the queen from the movie.",
