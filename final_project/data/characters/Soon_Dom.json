 "content": "Soon Dom was a male Human who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Almost all parts of his body except his head had been replaced with cybernetics. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, Dom was present on the planet Dathomir when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility. Soon Dom fell victim to the Blackwing virus, and turned into an undead manifestation. His undead body was controlled by the virus and kept walking around in the Quarantine Zone until it was destroyed by a spacer. At the time of his death, he was wearing a chitin armor helmet.\nSoon Dom was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Soon Dom was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", released on October 12, 2009. He was one of the Undead boss enemies in the Quarantine Zone that players had to kill to complete a collection.",
