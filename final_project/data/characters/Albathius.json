 "content": "Albathius, also known as The Shining Man, was a Human male operative of the Star Cabal. He arrived on Voss around 3645 BBY, and gained great influence among Voss Mystics, convincing the Voss to stay neutral from the war between Galactic Republic and Sith Empire for three thousand days, enough time for the Star Cabal to exert its own influence on the war and keeping the Voss from choosing a side. He promised that in time, the Gormak, Empire and Republic would be eradicated, and no offworlders would come to Voss. He was buried under Voss-Ka after his death.",
