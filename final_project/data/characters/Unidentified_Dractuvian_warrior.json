 "content": "This Dractuvian Warrior lived on the planet of Dractu, and was a member of the sentient Dractuvian species. Sometime during the Clone Wars, this warrior was assigned by his chief to help a Besalisk adventurer named Dexter Jettster find some Dractuvian cave slugs in order to make a meal out of them. Along the way, the warrior helped Dexter out of several dangerous encounters such as large monsters, quicksand, and an attack from an Dractuvian caveworm. After Dexter had received his prize, the warrior bid him farewell as Dexter left the planet in his ship.",
