 "content": "Odoof Grunda was a male Gungan artist who lived on the Naboo moon of Rori. He was talented, but also eccentric and didn't like the city life. One of his paintings showed legendary sculptor Sidoras Bey crafting a statue of Emperor Palpatine.\nSometime after 0 ABY, Jaleela Bindoo asked a spacer to meet Grunda and bring his painting of Sidoras Bey back to Narmle for the annual Narmle Arts Gala, where the image was shown during the opening ceremony.\nIn Star Wars Galaxies Jaleela Bindoo sends the player into the wilderness near Narmle to meet Grunda. Talking to the Gungan non-player character places a painting in the player's inventory which will be removed again when the player talks to Bindoo to complete the quest. Using a trick, the player can put the painting into a backpack or his house, restart the mission and keep the painting for himself. The painting is only a copy of another painting which is called \"Painting of a Ronka Plant\".",
