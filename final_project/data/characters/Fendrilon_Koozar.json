 "content": "Fendrilon Koozar was one of Emperor Palpatine's Advisors during the Galactic Civil War. He had a habit of sticking his nose where it was not welcome and often dined at the exclusive Manarai restaurant on Coruscant. In 3.5 ABY, Prince Xizor secretly arranged Koozar's murder for prying into the affairs of the Black Sun crime syndicate. The Manarai's head chef, Tavvar Va'ran, introduced several poisons into Koozar's meal, which later caused him to throw a hallucinatory fit while aboard his luxury airspeeder. Koozar crashed the speeder into a government building, killing himself in a fiery explosion.\nFendrilon Koozar was an Imperial Advisor who served Emperor Palpatine during the Galactic Civil War. Koozar developed an alarming habit of meddling in business where he was not welcome, including the operations of the Black Sun crime syndicate. He regularly enjoyed the high cuisine of the Manarai restaurant, the most exclusive dining venue in Imperial City on the planet Coruscant, where Black Sun leader Prince Xizor secretly arranged Koozar's murder in 3.5 ABY.\nXizor's chief lieutenant, Guri, visited the Manarai and instructed the restaurant's Master Chef, Tavvar Va'ran, to give Koozar the \"house special,\" a code for adding a combination of natural food seasonings and nearly untraceable chemicals into a victim's dishes throughout the meal. This poisoned recipe would work in conjunction with the natural oils and spices found within the meal, as well as Koozar's own Human digestive system, to cause certain unpleasant effects several hours later, which often resulted in a painful death.\nKoozar's meal that night included an appetizer of raw Wroonian flycatcher filet, followed by a bowl of sufar greens topped with mecolar briddlings and drezzle sauce, and fleek-eel broiled in zaffa oil for the main course; he had not yet ordered dessert. To satisfy Guri's desire for discreetness—she suggested something that might induce hallucinations and cause Koozar to step out of his moving speeder or jump off his tower balcony—Va'ran added a dose of tasteless thetametabuterin to Koozar's flycatcher filet, a hybrid mold on the greens briddlings, and some collafa spice in the zaffa oil.\nThe Master Chef's culinary work had the desired effect. The evening after Koozar's dinner at the Manarai, Va'ran saw on the newsnets that the Imperial Advisor had thrown an uncontrollable fit while in his luxury airspeeder, wresting away the controls from his droid pilot and crashing the speeder into the Ministry of Land Management. Koozar died in the fiery explosion that followed.\nFendrilon Koozar was a connoisseur of fine foods who often dined at the Manarai, Coruscant's most exclusive restaurant and the central gathering place for the Imperial Center elite. As one of the Emperor's Advisors, Koozar had a habit of poking his nose in others' affairs, which eventually led to his murder, as orchestrated by Prince Xizor of Black Sun. Guri, fully trained in proper social etiquette and culture, displayed a distaste for the high tastes to which Koozar often treated himself.\nFendrilon Koozar was created for the short narrative A Very Special Meal, written by Peter Schweighofer for the June 1996 Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook. Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook explains that several influential beings, including an Imperial Advisor, were rumored to have a stake in the Manarai's ownership, but the text does not identify this individual.",
