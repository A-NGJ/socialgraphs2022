He would later emerge several years later leading The Shield, a small militant group that was feeding funds and supplies to Rebel Alliance operatives. Around 0 BBY he wedded fellow operative Filice Ginzork.\nPeert Ginzork served the Galactic Empire as an Imperial Army trooper. He deserted in the middle of deployment and went underground for several months before emerging under the assumed name 'Peert Ginzork'. He met Filice Ginzork sometime after that and the two maintained a relationship for many years before they were eventually married around 0 BBY.\nPeert also set up The Shield, a private security company focused on protecting corporate couriers. He later expanded their business to include executive bodyguarding and counter-espiionage. Secretly the organization were operatives working for Alliance Intelligence under Airen Cracken.\nPeert was the assumed name of a Human male who was very symapathetic to the Rebel Alliance's cause. He tempered his physical training with patience.\nPeert was highly trained in most forms of combat being an excellent shot with blasters, blaster rifles, and artillery. He was also skilled at piloting repulsorlift vehicles and other ground vehicles. Peert was also an effective leader.\nIn combat Peert carried a blaster rifle, a heavy blaster pistol, grenades, a thermal detonator, a comlink and a protective vest.\nPeert Ginzork was designed by Rick Olshak for Cracken's Rebel Operatives, a supplement for the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game that was published by West End Games in 1994. He was illustrated by Mike Vilardi.",
