 "content": "Bibo was a juvenile male rokkna adopted by Neeku Vozo in 34 ABY. After winding up on the Colossus after being caught inside a wrecked Z-95 Headhunter from the Karavian Trench of Castilon's ocean that was salvaged by Synara San, Vozo was taken with the creature immediately after seeing him and decided to adopt him as a pet and name him Bibo. However, this attracted the ire of his mother, a full-grown adult of the species, who threatened the entire platform while attempting to retrieve Bibo. After realizing Bibo was the creature's child, Vozo finally let Bibo go.\nAfter the sabotage of the Colossus, Kazuda Xiono asked Vozo who his friends were, causing the mechanic to mention a particular chair, Buggles, and note how he loved Bibo. Vozo then pondered what Bibo was currently doing.",
