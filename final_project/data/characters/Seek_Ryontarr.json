 "content": "Seek Ryontarr was a male Gotal Jedi Knight who was active in the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Disappearing before the Clone Wars, Ryontarr was discovered over half a century later in a space station deep within the Maw.\nSeek Ryontarr was trained in the ways of the Force, and eventually went onto graduate before being selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master. After Ryontarr passed his Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council, the High Council assigned Ryontarr many missions that took him across the galaxy. One such assignment took him to Nath Goordi, where the death of the planet's ruler placed the lives of the throne's heirs in danger. Resolving the conflict, Ryontarr was known to have left the planet, but never returned to the Temple on Coruscant.\nDeeming his disappearance a mystery, the Curator of Records placed Ryontarr on the roster of missing Jedi, which made its way into the Great Holocron before the end of the Clone Wars. As the Jedi Order was abolished during the rise of the Galactic Empire, all memory of Ryontarr seemed lost until the ancient artifact was rediscovered after the Galactic Civil War by the leader of the reformed Order. Investigating its mysteries, Grand Master Luke Skywalker came across Ryontarr's name as he scanned the text for clues as to any surviving Jedi's location.\nNearly a decade later, Master Skywalker and his son, Ben were investigating a disturbance in the Maw when the pair stumbled across the mysterious Sinkhole Station; the same station Skywalker's wayward nephew had visited five years before. Exploring the space station, the Skywalkers discovered a group of people known as the Mind Walkers, many of them seemingly empty shells. Among them, Ryontarr was the most amicable to speak and introduced Master Skywalker to the techniques used by the Mind Walkers. Ryontarr convinced Skywalker to travel with him to a realm of the Force called beyond shadows to discover what Skywalker's nephew Darth Caedus had seen when he visited the site five years before. While beyond shadows, Ryontarr's body died, but his Force essence still served as a guide to the elder Skywalker to the many places beyond shadows which Caedus had seen half a decade prior.",
