 "content": "Taepalae was a Human female and the leader of a small group of salvagers on Dantooine.\nShe met Meetra Surik near the ruined Jedi Enclave after one of her companions, Jorran, had been trapped in a room after they all had been attacked by laigreks, forcing all but Jorran to leave the Enclave.\nWhen Surik rescued Jorran, Taepalae recommended Surik accept a reward the next time she saved someone's life.\nThe Jedi Exile might provoke Taepalae and her companions to a fight by insulting them during the conversation of their first encounter. This results in a dark side shift for the Exile.",
