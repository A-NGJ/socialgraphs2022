 "content": "Seteem Ervic was a farmer who lived on Saffalore.\nAfter inheriting his family's business, Seteem spent years working to make it successful. He eventually achieved his goal, though it cost him, among other things, his first wife and most of his hair. He hoped his daughter would one day take over and expand the business worldwide.\nOne day, while transporting grain cakes to the city of Lurark, he came upon a woman lying in the road. After getting out to check on her, she drew a blaster pistol, and he turned to find the members of Wraith Squadron gathered around his landspeeder, which he promptly surrendered.",
