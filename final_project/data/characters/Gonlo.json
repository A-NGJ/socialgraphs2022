 "content": "Gonlo was a male Weequay who, along with Jubei, was the personal bodyguard of Saquesh in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War. When Meetra Surik arrived on Nar Shaddaa, Gonlo, Jubei, and Saquesh were all killed when Saquesh refused Surik's request to leave the refugees that he oversaw alone.\nIf the Exile chooses to have the refugee Adana sold into slavery without convincing her mother, Nadaa, to sell herself with her, then she can lie to Saquesh by telling him that the refugees are planning a rescue. He orders Gonlo to have Adana taken away from the refugee sector and sold. \nIf the Exile has a high enough persuasion, she can convince Saquesh to give the refugees more space by claiming that one of the refugees, Geriel, has a contagious ilness. This is a bluff, since in fact the Exile cures Geriel. In this instance, neither Gonlo, Jubei or Saquesh are killed.",
