 "content": "Rute Gunnay was a Neimoidian male who served as an advisor to Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray during the Clone Wars and final years of the Galactic Republic. Gunnay, along with the Separatist Council, met his demise at the hands of Darth Vader on the planet Mustafar.\nRute Gunnay was a Neimoidian who served as a senatorial aide in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars. As such, he was responsible for writing drafts, sending sneaky messages, and managing the secret meetings of self-interested senators. At some point during the conflict, he joined the Trade Federation and Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the Separatist Council was sent to Mustafar at the end of the war, Gunnay accompanied them. The Council's secret ally, Darth Sidious contacted them and told them that his new apprentice, Darth Vader would come and 'take care' of them. However, when Vader arrived the proceeded to slaughter the Council. Helpless, Gunnay was sliced across the chest as he tried to escape into the conference room with his superiors. After Gunnay's death, Vader killed Nute Gunray and the remaining Separatists.\nRute Gunnay first appeared in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and was portrayed by Colin Ware. The character was later identified in the 2013 digital card game Star Wars: Force Collection. In Star Wars Legends, the character was identified as Aruteous Gunnay.",
