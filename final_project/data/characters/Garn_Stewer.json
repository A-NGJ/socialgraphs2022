 "content": "Garn Stewer was a human male who acted as chief technician of the starship maintenance crew in the Alliance to Restore the Republic's base on the moon Yavin 4. His team knew the T-65 X-wing starfighters, BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers and UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support crafts that they maintained as well as the rebel pilots that flew them, and Stewer made sure there was a symbiotic relationship between the pilots and ground crew in the base. The chief would often implore the pilots with exhausted futility to not damage \"his\" starfighters; however, these complaints masked a good humor shared between Stewer and his crew and the pilots. In the year 0 BBY, he was present in the base's hangar when the criminal Jyn Erso was brought in to take part in Operation Fracture. Stewer had brown hair and eyes and fair skin. While in the base he wore a synthetic fabric boilersuit and a variant of the standard Alliance service helmet with a comlink but no visor. Between 1 ABY and 3 ABY, Stewer served as hangar chief aboard the Rebel ship Home One. He was working on disgraced pilot's Ibti Myrak's T-65B X-wing starfighter when she tried to board it in an emergency. The pilot got into a verbal altercation with Admiral Gial Ackbar, and Stewer intervened. However, Myrak threw him off and left in her ship. Stewer then informed the admiral that she had jumped to hyperspace to save Rogue Squadron during the ambush in the Valo system. When they returned, Stewer helped arrest double agent Lyle Kullan. At one point, the chief sired a son, named Garn Stewer, Jr. who served as an A-wing pilot for the Resistance.\nGarn Stewer first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016. Stewer was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
