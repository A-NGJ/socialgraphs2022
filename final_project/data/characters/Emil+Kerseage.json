 "content": "Emil Kerseage was the pilot of the shuttle that brought Kinman Doriana to Cartao. After the First Battle of Geonosis the transport company Kerseage had owned had been run out of business by a poorly worded regulation the Prackla Trade Council had issued. Kerseage's company was gone, and he blamed Lord Pilester Binalie for it. Kinman Doriana used his case as on official cover for his mission to Cartao.",
