 "content": "Kallakar, also known as Kallakar the Savage, was a male Nikto residing on Nar Shaddaa around 3643 BBY, when he was killed.\nKallakar appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Nar Shaddaa. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
