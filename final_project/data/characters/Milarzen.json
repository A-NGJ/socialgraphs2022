 "content": "Milarzen was a male Human and the Prime Minister of an unknown planet that had a Galactic Republic membership. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, he was taken as a hostage by Imperial Strategist Arkos Rakton with fellow planetary leaders, but freed by the Major of Havoc Squad.\nMilarzen was a male Human, and the Prime Minister of an unknown planet that had a Galactic Republic membership. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, the latter had just received a giant blow to their forces, and their Imperial Strategist; Arkos Rakton set in motion a new strategy. While attacking several Republic aligned worlds, he called for a diplomatic summit on Outpost 256 with several of the governmental figures. Milarzen was one of these. It was however a deception as Aarkos took them all hostage and threatened their lives if they would not join the cause of the Sith Empire. Two of the figures eventually succumbed and decided to take up on the offer, but at the same time the Major of Havoc Squad bust into the room and shot down all the Imperial troops. While the recent traitors were remorseful of their actions, Milarzen would not stand for such behavior and condemned them both. In the end he had gained a strong opinion of how evil the Empire was, and that any that sets foot on their worlds would be met with death. The Major of Havoc Squad then left and Milarzen was left on the station with his fellow dignitaries.\nThe Prime Minister stood fast in his principles, both political and moral as he demonstrated when he condemned his fellow government figures that had decided to side with the resurgent Sith Empire and used their own people as an excuse.\nThe Prime Minister had a pink skin color and green eyes with sand blonde hair. He spoke the language Basic, and wore formal clothing consisting of a green robe, boots and gloves with tan pants.\nMilarzen was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. The Prime Minister could only be encountered in the \"Trooper\" class storyline, during the mission \"Operation Talon\",",
