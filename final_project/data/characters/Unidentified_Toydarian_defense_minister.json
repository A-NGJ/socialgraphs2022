 "content": "A defense minister was present on the Toydarian ministry council during the Clone Wars. When the planet Ryloth was invaded by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the inhabitants began to suffer. The defense minister was present in the Toydarian Royal Palace alongside King Katuunko and a few other ministers when Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa and Naboo Representative Jar Jar Binks approached them, asking for aid for the suffering Twi'leks. However, Neimoidian Senator Lott Dod arrived to argue that sending relief supply ship to Ryloth would be in violation of Toydaria's agreements with the Trade Federation. After both factions debated for the council, this minister suggested they help the Twi'leks as compassion was a way of the Toydarians. Ultimately, Katuunko publicly refused to send help, but discreetly allowed Organa's ships to launch from Toydaria.",
