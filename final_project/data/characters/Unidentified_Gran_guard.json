 "content": "A Gran male guard and bounty hunter protected a village, when the village was attacked by bandits who followed a Sith named Kouru. The guards stepped in to defend the villagers after being signaled by the village chief. After Kouru killed their Trandoshan commander, a second wave of bandits killed the rest of the guards apart from the Gran. He was the only guard to survive the skirmish.\nThe Gran guard later journeyed to the city of Osou, where he reported, falsely, that the village he guarded had been attacked by the former Sith known as the Ronin. The Gran went to a cantina and told stories of a Sith bandit who had waylaid the village for months, which would have accurately described Kouru but he instead presented as the Ronin. \"Wanted\" posters for the Ronin were posted in the city, and the Ronin was then hunted by the Genbara military at the Osou spaceport.\nThe Gran first appeared in \"The Duel,\" a short film in the Star Wars: Visions series directed by Takanobu Mizuno, produced by Kamikaze Douga, and released on Disney+ on September 22, 2021. He was voiced by Shinya Takahashi in the original Japanese and by Neil Kaplan in the English dub.",
