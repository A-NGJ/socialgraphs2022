 "content": "Pac was an alias that was used by a male Cerean who served as a private in the Cularin Militia during the time of the Clone Wars. Following the discovery of a document written by the explorer Reidi Artom, Pac and two Militia privates under the alias' Grunt and Mack made their way to the offices of Cularin Central Broadcasting on the planet Cularin and demanded to be interviewed by the reporter Yara Grugara. Grugara agreed to their proposition and during the interview, Pac and his compatriots explained that they were opposed to the anti-war views that Artom expressed in the recently discovered document.",
