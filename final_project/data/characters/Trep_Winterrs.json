 "content": "Trep Winterrs was a smuggler hired by Professor Arner Figgis to teach him the basics of Olys Corellisi and introduce him to other speakers of the language.\nHe took the scholar to the Black Dust Tavern so Figgis could speak and observe the language. However, the greeting that Figgis attempted to use on Karl Mathieu Ancher was misspoken so the smuggler had to step in and defuse the situation before it turned violent. He made the scholar buy a drink for the bartender, and then lead him to a table to play sabaac with some of the locals so Figgis could study the language in use.",
