 "content": "Urinth was a female Human Inquisitor of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nShe resided in the Sith Academy on Korriban, and represented the Intelligence Operations of the Sith. Once she told an acolyte that she had captured a Jedi trying to infiltrate the Academy. Through sorcery and drugs, she manipulated his mind so when he returned to the Order he would unknowingly feed false information to the Republic. The information was supposed to lead some Outer Rim colonies to reduce their defenses, so the Sith could destroy them. To bring the information to the Republic, the acolyte had to gain the Jedi's trust and then secretly release him so he'd escape without questioning.",
