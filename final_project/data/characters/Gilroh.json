 "content": "Gilroh was a Human male who served in the Republic Military during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. He deserted after five years on Taris, and escaped thanks to a traveling hero.\nA Republic trooper during the Cold War, Gilroh was stationed on Taris from 3647 BBY until 3643 BBY, when he decided to desert. Stationed on Taris at Waypoint Station Draay, Gilroh was one of many troopers who had been serving on the planet for the last five years, despite it only being a one-year assignment. Five years of attacks by rakghouls, pirates, and scavengers had broken Gilroh and his friends' spirits, until they finally gave up.\nAround the year 3643 BBY, Gilrooh was part of the monthly supply convoy sent from Waypoint Station Cresh to Waypoint Station Draay in the west. He, Ferdoin, Geozel, and the rest of the convoy decided to desert on one of their runs, leaving Morne without supplies as they hid in the wilderness.\nDraay's quartermaster Kahrin Wek grew concerned over the lack of response from Morne, so she asked a traveling hero, who had helped her expose her superior Commander Gardit's corruption, to investigate. The hero found the convoy, and Gilroh attempted to lie that they were only stopping to rest. But he quickly gave up and told the truth, asking the stranger what they planned to do.\nTo Gilroh's surprise, instead of turning them in, the hero gave Gilroh enough credits to buy a spot on a smuggler's ship. Gilroh thanked the hero and told them that he planned to find his girlfriend and try to fix things between them. The hero would inform Gilroh's superior Commander Yajak that they had found the convoy's bodies in the wilds, ensuring their safe escape.\nGilroh was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears as part of the Taris mission \"AWOL\". The player can choose to allow the troopers to desert, as the light side option, or force them to return to service as the dark side option.",
