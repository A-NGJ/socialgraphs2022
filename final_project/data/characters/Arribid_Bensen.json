 "content": "Arribid Bensen was a male Human who served in the Imperial Army under Darth Marr as Under-Moff. The title Under-Moff was created especially for Bensen as the top military engineer and geologist. In 3640 BBY Bensen was on Corellia and witnessed the duel between Darth Thanaton and Darth Nox that ended the Kaggath between them. Following the Conquest of Makeb, Bensen was chosen by Darth Marr to oversee the mining of Isotope-5 on the planet.\nBensen appeared to be well informed of the Dark Council affairs of his day; he was aware of the demise of Darth Baras at the \"Emperor's Wrath\" hands, and the fate of Darth Thanaton at Darth Nox's.\nArribid Bensen first appeared in game update 2.0 Rise of the Hutt Cartel of the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2013.\nHe is only accessible through the Contain and Control quest series of the Imperial players in the game on Makeb.",
