 "content": "Blood Scream was a male Esh-kha warrior who was imprisoned with the rest of his species by the Rakata in the Tomb on Belsavis. During the invasion of Belsavis in the Galactic War, the Esh-kha were released, and Blood Scream was among the warriors who fought to eradicate the \"pestilence\" of non-Esh-kha. Although considered a \"power couple,\" Blood Scream and another warrior, Skull Shatter, were slain by Imperials in battle among the vaults of the Tomb.\nBlood Scream appears on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he and Skull Shatter must be defeated in the Imperial mission \"Erasing the Esh-kha.\"",
