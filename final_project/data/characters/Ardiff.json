 "content": "Ardiff was a human male who held the rank of captain within the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. He served as the commanding officer of the notable flagship Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Chimaera. In the years leading up to the peace accords between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic as well as the rumors of Grand Admiral Thrawn's return some nineteen years after the Battle of Yavin. He was extremely loyal to his commanding officer and Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet Gilad Pellaeon despite his misgivings of Pellaeon's planned meeting and eventual treaty with the New Republic. He was the commanding officer of the Chimaera during the signing of the Pellaeonâ€“Gavrisom Treaty.\nArdiff first appeared in the 1997 novel Specter of the Past by Timothy Zahn. He would later appeared in 1998 novel Vision of the Future. Ardiff takes the place of Pellaeon during the Battle of Pesitiin, as he questioned his superior about the tactics he is making.",
