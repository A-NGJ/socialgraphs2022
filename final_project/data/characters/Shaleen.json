 "content": "Shaleen was a female Voss who left her homeworld of Voss to visit the Galactic Republic's space station Carrick Station, where she traded equipment.\nShaleen appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Voss Equipment Commendations Vendor on Carrick Station, though she was later relabeled as a Level 45 Equipment Commendations Vendor. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, she was removed from the game along with the rest of the Equipment Commendations Vendors. Like her counterpart Vortine, Shaleen was not given an actual Voss name with a suffix.",
