 "content": "Captain Mantrony was a female Bakuran naval officer who served under Admiral Hortel Ossilege. She commanded the Namana-class light cruiser Watchkeeper. During the First Corellian Insurrection, the Watchkeeper was one of four ships that penetrated the interdiction field encompassing the Corellian system using an experimental device called the hyperwave inertial momentum sustainer. Unfortunately, Captain Mantrony's vessel was damaged in the process and lost its propulsion systems.\nOver Captain Mantony's objections, Admiral Ossilege proposed to use the drifting Watchkeeper as a decoy to draw out the secret weapon of the Sacorrian Triad on Selonia.",
