 "content": "This Kajain'sa'Nikto was an associate of the space pirate Rav. This pirate was present when Rav was offering Cade Skywalker a bounty on some natives on Wayland. The pirate attacked Cade after he insulted the Nikto's family, but Cade easily Force pushed him of a waterfall.\nThis Nikto pirate was arrogant in that he believed that he could take someone from the Skywalker line. He also was deeply offended when Cade insulted his family.\nThis Nikto was capable of using a cortosis staff. He believed himself capable of fighting Cade Skywalker, who was immensely powerful in the Force. In the end, he was unable to hold his own against Skywalker.",
