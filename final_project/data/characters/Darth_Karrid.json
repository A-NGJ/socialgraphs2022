 "content": "Darth Karrid, born Kana Terrid, was a female Falleen former Jedi who turned herself over to the dark side and became a Sith Lord of the Sith Empire under the tutelage of Darth Malgus during the later years of the Great Galactic War. During the Galactic War, she commanded the Sith's ultimate warship, the Ascendant Spear, via a cybernetic interface. She also succeeded Darth Hadra as Head of the Sphere of Technology and took her seat on the Dark Council. When she in turn was killed over Duro, Darth Acina replaced her on the Council.\nBorn during the Great Galactic War, Kana Terrid was a female Falleen found to be sensitive to the Force and enrolled into the Jedi Order. Placed under the tutelage of Jedi Master Gnost-Dural, she soon distinguished herself from the other Padawans by her ambition and her adventurous behavior, which led her master to put her on a dangerous mission in the Sith Empire. Indeed during the Cold War, Terrid was tasked to infiltrate the Sith Order as a double agent by becoming the apprentice of Darth Malgus, but over the years she began to believe in the Sith tenets and fell to the dark side, giving Republic intel to her Sith masters. The final stage of her transformation occurred when lured by the prospect of becoming the commander of the Ascendant Spear, a highly advanced warship designed by Darth Mekhis, she fully gave herself to the dark side by receiving the implants enabling her to control the starship, becoming Darth Karrid.\nWithout having lost a single battle during the renewal of the hostilities between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Karrid soon earned a reputation of a strategic prodigy and ruthless leader which attracted the favor of Darth Marr. Thus, the Sith Councilor supported her accession to the Dark Council to replace the deceased Darth Hadra as head of the Sphere of Technology, but the other Sith Lords favored Darth Gravus due to their xenophobia towards non-Human and non-Pureblood Sith and also because of Darth Karrid's former master's attempted coup. When she learned from Marr about the Council favoring Gravus, she devised a plan to discredit him. Karrid intervened in Gravus's battle at Leritor, where she goaded him into attacking her, giving her the right to destroy his ship. She simultaneously attacked and destroyed both the Imperial and Republic fleets. When Gravus begged for mercy, she refused to listen and proceeded with killing him. This act gave her the Dark Council's approval and was appointed as Darth Hadra's replacement.\nNot long after, Theron Shan, the man who foiled Mekhis's plans years earlier, was determined to destroy the last of her creations. He and Karrid's former master, Gnost-Dural, infiltrated the Ascendant Spear and proceeded to sabotage it while finding a way to make Karrid go to Duro, where the Empire was planning to attack next. Karrid eventually became aware of Gnost-Dural being aboard, and knowing that she could not defeat him alone due to most of her time spent on becoming acquainted with her ship, fought him with her apprentices. Gnost-Dural allowed himself to be captured and, preying on Karrid's ego, acted to have been trying to prevent her from going to Duro. When Gnost-Dural proclaimed that it was too late to go, Karrid fell for the bait and set a course to the planet.\nUpon arrival at Duro, she immediately began to fire at fleeing Imperial ships who had fled the battle. She then began to fire at the Republic fleet gathered by Jace Malcom, but was surprised that she missed completely. Eventually, she realized that a saboteur on her ship was uploading viruses, and took steps to prevent him from interfering any further. As Karrid was going to fire the killing shot at the Republic fleet, the saboteur, Theron, flooded the ship's systems with false data, overloading them. Karrid, who was one with her ship, lost connection with it and opened the command pod which she used to control it. Seeing that a man in his underwear  had caused Mekhis's ultimate creation to be ruined, she activated her lightsaber and began to attack him. The timing of Republic ships attacking the Spear's exterior saved Theron from certain death. Frustrated that her all-mighty ship was going to be destroyed, she rushed back into the command pod in a desperate attempt to save it. However, Theron had no intention to leave her alive, and threw his discharged blaster into the pod before it closed, killing Darth Karrid and ending the threat of the Ascendant Spear once and for all.\nWith Darth Karrid dead and her position vacant, the Emperor's Hand later chose Darth Acina to replace her. Defeating Darth Karrid would become a story Theron liked to tell, which he believed he told better than Gnost-Dural.\nDarth Karrid was an expert on technology. She was a practitioner of the lightsaber form Niman and also capable of Force lightning.\nDarth Karrid was first introduced in the 2012 novel The Old Republic: Annihilation, which stated that Darth Karrid was chosen as Darth Hadra's successor. However, the character Darth Acina was introduced in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, the first Digital Expansion for the BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and her Codex entry stated that she was the successor to Hadra. The Codex entry's error was rectified in Update 2.1.1 to correctly state that Acina succeeded Karrid.",
