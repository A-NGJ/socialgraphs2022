 "content": "Brakko Gaz was a male Rodian who lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Gaz worked for Groff Haugg, the owner of Haugg Nerf Industries, a cover for a Death stick dealing operation Huagg also ran. While working for Haugg on the planet Coruscant, Gaz murdered several local business men. The Republic Security Force placed a bounty on his head for the murders with a reward of 1000 credits for his capture alive and 500 credits dead. By 32 BBY, Gaz had fled Coruscant and ended up on Outland Station. Whilst on the station he ran into the Mandalorian bounty hunter, Jango Fett who he attacked with a blaster pistol along with a pair of Trandoshans. Fett, who had been informed of the bounty on Gaz claim it after capturing him alive for 1,000 credits.\nIn the video game, Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Brakko Gaz is the third or fourth of five possible secondary bounties that a player can secure in the pit fighters arena section in the games first chapter. Players have the option of taking him alive or killing him however as Gaz is worth 1000 credits alive and only 500 credits dead this article assumes that Fett took the bounty alive for a higher reward.",
