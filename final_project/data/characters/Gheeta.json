 "content": "Gheeta was once in charge of the design of the terminal and diplomatic reception site on Circumtore, and was high up in the Shell Hutt hierarchy. After a bungled attempt to have Emd Grahvess killed he was demoted to a negotiator. Grahvess had been saved by Boba Fett.\nYears later when Boba Fett returned, Gheeta went crazy in rage and attempted to have him, his Bounty Hunters' Guild team, and the rest of the Shell Hutts killed. In the ensuing battle, he was killed and Boba Fett escaped.",
