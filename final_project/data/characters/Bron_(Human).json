 "content": "Bron was a male Human who served as a representative for the Galactic Republic during the final years of the Republic Classic era.\nIn 33 BBY, Bron was assigned to Cerea to \"observe\" Cerean ways and persuade the local population to technological progress to the citizens of the Republic. As he landed on Cerea, he was one of the few to be granted permission to move outside the citadel. However, he used this as an opportunity to keep public appearances about the benefits of civilized life. His speeches were particularly among the younger generation of the Cerean that were deliberately against the Cerean Elder since it was revealed that he served as an agent to Jabba the Hutt. Eventually, Bron retreated from public life, though there were rumors, that he was complicit in this plot.",
