 "content": "Kam Wendan was a male Human citizen of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. In 3631 BBY, he was visiting the Old World, where he was betting on the pit fights in the Arena with Mona Gale. After a six consecutive loss, Wendan witnessed the dialogue between Mona and a renegade member of the Knights of Zakuul Senya Tirall. During that time, a broadcast by Emperor Arcann identified Tirall and the Commander as dangerous fugitives, prompting Gale to provide them information and Wendan to smile and wave his hand peacefully.\nKam Wendan appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 7: The Lady of Sorrows. He is voiced by Nolan North.",
