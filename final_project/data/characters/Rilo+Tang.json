 "content": "Rilo Tang was a human male who served as a gunnery officer in the Imperial Military prior to the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. He was an eager officer who had a reputation as a kleptomaniac. On one occasion, he stole a particularly valuable ring from a Moff. As a result, Tang was interrogated for his confession by the Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, who broke many of his bones and disfigured him. Following the incident, Rath Velus heard that Tang had ended up working in the trash compactors.\nThe human Rilo Tang lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire and attended an Imperial academy. He became a gunnery officer at some point prior to the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, ultimately being assigned to a unit that included the Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus. Given Tang's psychological profile, Rath Velus suspected that the young man's parents had sent him to the academies to reform him into a \"proper galactic citizen.\"\nDuring his time in the Imperial Military, Tang exhibited kleptomania; he had a reputation for stealing the personal effects of other Imperial personnel, including holopics, ID tags, and even a private's pair of shoes. Rath Velus and others warned Tang many times against this behavior, but he was unable to manage his condition. When the gunnery officer stole a ring from a Moff that contained encoded information, Rath Velus was tasked with soliciting a confession from him. In the process, the loyalty officer broke many bones in Tang's body and disfigured his face. Rath Velus later heard rumors that Tang had survived the incident and ended up working the trash compactors.\nIn 4 ABY, after defecting from the Empire and fleeing to the dissident Outer Rim planet Akiva, a guilt-ridden Rath Velus related the story of Tang's interrogation to the New Republic pilot Norra Wexley during a discussion about Velus's days as an Imperial. While the former loyalty officer often held no remorse in his prior occupation, hurting Rilo Tang was one of the cases in which he found little relish.\nRilo Tang's interrogator, Sinjir Rath Velus, felt that he had an attractive appearance with eyes that shone as bright as polished credits. By the time Tang had stolen a Moff's ring, he possessed a youthful appearance. He was an eager and bright Imperial officer but was unable to manage his compulsion to steal despite receiving warnings for his behavior.\nFollowing a string of petty thefts, Tang stole a Moff's ring and was brutally interrogated by Rath Velus. The incident left Tang with numerous broken bones and a disfigured face. When later recounting the interrogation, Rath Velus reminisced that Tang had been a troubled youth and suspected that the officer's parents had sent him to the Imperial academies hoping to control his kleptomania.\nRilo Tang was mentioned in the 2015 novel Aftermath, the first volume in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy, written by Chuck Wendig.",
