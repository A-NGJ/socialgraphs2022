 "content": "Umjing Baab was a male Rughja who led an orchestra-band called Umjing Baab and His Swinging Trioâ€”which, despite its name, was made up of Baab and only two, not three, other musicians. Since he, like the rest of his band, was a fifteen-limbed Rughja, he could play the kloo horn, the nalargon, and at least eight other instruments simultaneously.",
