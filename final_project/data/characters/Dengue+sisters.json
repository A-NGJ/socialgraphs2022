 "content": "The Dengue sisters were a group of Culisetto. They were present at Maz Kanata's castle around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. Their favorite game was a board game called Deia's Dream. The Dengue sisters wore traditional Culisetto travel smocks.\nThe Dengue sisters were created for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The aliens were not identified in the film, but received a name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film's release. The name \"Dengue sisters\" was inspired by the Culisetto species' resemblance to mosquitoes; dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease. However, while the name Culisetto was inspired by the Culiseta genus of mosquitoes, the dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus.",
