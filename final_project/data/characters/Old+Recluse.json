 "content": "The Old Recluse was an ancient Morish spy for the Imperial Remnant at the end of the Galactic Civil War.\nHe resided in a cave, a secret Imperial communications center, in the higher parts of the Tatmana Mountains. He used the cave's equipment to act as a kind of prophet in order to impress and indoctrinate the Morish population. He also spied on the neighboring New Republic installation.\nThe trick was discovered by Lando Calrissian when he went to the cave with Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu, and Wes Janson in 19 ABY. The Old Recluse tried to sell them the story of the Destruction of Caamas for 300 credits. Calrissian smelled and recognized the odor of the old electronic equipment, which he likened to the smell of the Spaarti cloning plant on Wayland. The Old Recluse attempted to shoot Calrissian, but was arrested and disarmed.",
