 "content": "Lieutenant Diss Ti'wyn was a male Bothan pilot in Blackmoon Squadron. He flew in Yakown Reth's squadron as Blackmoon Two. Ti'wyn had brown and gold fur and was known to be quite attractive, receiving a great deal of attention in social situations from both Bothans and Humans.\nTi'wyn listened calmly as Yakown Reth aired his grievances against General Wedge Antilles, Jaina Solo, and the leadership of the New Republic in general. Ti'wyn urged his squad leader to keep calm and remain patient. Upon Luke's return from his expedition to Coruscant it was stated that, only that day, Blackmoon Squadron had lost three pilots, including its commander and second in command, implying that Diss Ti'wyn had died in action.",
