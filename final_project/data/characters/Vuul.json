 "content": "Vuul was the President of the planet Bri'ahl during the Clone Wars. He made the decision to side with the Galactic Republic after Senator Amidala visited the planet.\nWhen Bri'ahlian President Vuul sought an alliance with the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, he caused mixed feelings among his subjects, for which some of his kin that were Pro-Separatists, wanted to kill Vuul and Senator Padm√© Amidala of Naboo shortly before the treaty could be signed. This attempt was prevented by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO by chance. Following this, Vuul once again expressed his loyalty to the Republic.",
