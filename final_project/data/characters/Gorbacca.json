 "content": "Gorbacca was a Wookiee who served in the Rebel Alliance.\nGorbacca grew up as a slave to the Galactic Empire. However, he was spared the hard labor that most Wookiee slaves undergo, as he showed an affinity for using technology. He was sent to work with a tech and although he wasn't treated very well, Gorbacca had a better life than many of his species. After the base he was working in was attacked by the Rebel Alliance, Gorbacca was freed from slavery. He didn't know what to do, so he joined the Alliance, despite being mistrustful of it. He was assigned to serve aboard the ship Griffon's Wings, but it was shot down on the planet Yorgraxx after being attacked by Imperial ships. Gorbacca was among the crash survivors and they joined up with two survivors from an Imperial ship that had crashed on the planet about a month early. Gorbacca and the group entered the fortress of the Sith Lord Quorlac Fornayh, where they were confronted by his spirit.",
