 "content": "House Korden was a noble house established 14,000 years before the Battle of Yavin. While it was not a well-known to the galaxy at large, House Korden contributed greatly to intergalactic colonization efforts during early galactic history.\nAround 12,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, Haddius Korden, a successful merchant from Corulag, turned his family business into Korden Outfitting and Surveying, which supplied a wide variety of equipment to colonists headed for the farthest frontiers of the known galaxy. House Korden eventually began to invest in new colonies, leading to greater visibility of Korden Outfitting and Surveying chains, as well as leading House Korden to own colonies in over 6,000 star systems by the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nHouse Korden was established as an official Noble House in the year 9349 BBY. Later, on the 1,000th anniversary of the colonization of Novar, a planet in the Expansion Region, a special tract of land was turned over to House Korden as a result of their contributions to Novar's development.\nThroughout history, members of House Korden could be found in both the Galactic Senate as well as the Jedi Order, using their influence to promote peace. Members of House Korden also contributed to the efforts of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in its fight against the Galactic Empire.",
