 "content": "Beckman was a male Human officer who served as a Commander in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn the year 3 ABY, he was in command of the Rebel Hospital and its attending ships. The Hospital was attacked by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Corrupter during a bacta shipment being carried out by the Azzameen family. After the Battle of Hoth, Beckman led the base's evacuation until he was killed as the Imperial seized the hospital. Before his death, he pleaded the Azzameens to defend the transports that were carrying wounded Rebel personnel who had been injured during the firefight.",
