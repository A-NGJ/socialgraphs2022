 "content": "Dams Denna was a diminutive human male from the planet Naboo who worked as an animal trainer. In 32 BBY, he attended a celebratory parade held in the streets of Naboo's capital, Theed, following the Naboo and Gungan victory over the Trade Federation during the Battle of Naboo. During the festivities, General Jar Jar Binks was among the Gungans that rode down Theed's Palace Plaza escorting Boss Rugor Nass.\nUpon reaching the end of the plaza, Binks attempted to dismount from his kaadu, but got his foot caught in a stirrup. Denna then moved forward and grabbed the kaadu's reigns, helping Binks before the animal trainer led the kaadu away. At the event, Denna wore a green outfit including a tunic, pants, and boots. He had light skin and brown hair.\nDams Denna appeared in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. The character was portrayed uncredited by Star Wars Insider publisher and Official Star Wars Fan Club president Dan Madsen as an Easter Egg, with the scene being filmed on an airstrip at Leavesden Studios. Madsen's cameo was revealed prior to the release of the film when he was pictured in costume in the article \"When Artoo Met Wicket\" in Star Wars Insider 39.\nIn the current Star Wars canon, Denna was was first identified in the English release of \"The Naboo Crisis,\" an entry in De Agostini's Star Wars Encyclopedia series that was originally released in Spanish on March 9, 2021. The name Dams Denna, an anagram of Dan Madsen, originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used on a card in the 2001 Theed Palace Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
