 "content": "Has Obitt was a male Dressellian who was a smuggler active during the reigns of both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire. Obitt became a pawn of Orson Krennic in his schemes for power. During Orson's initial scheme, Obitt was tasked with rescuing Galen, Lyra, and Jyn Erso from their Separatist captors on the planet Vallt. During the Imperial Era, Obitt traveled with Lyra to Alpinn searching for kyber crystals. Obitt was involved in a rebellion in the Salient system, along with Saw Gerrera and was captured at Salient II by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. During his capture, he arranged a deal with Tarkin to allow him to regain his freedom in exchange for getting back in Krennic's good graces and spying on Krennic for Tarkin. Has, however, secretly arranged for Saw Gerrera to help the Erso family escape from Coruscant.\nJyn Erso later had a toy doll named \"Lucky Hazz Obloobitt.\"\nHas Obitt first appeared in the 2016 canon novel Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, which was written by James Luceno. The novel served as a prequel to the Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Luceno created the character because the story required an additional foil for Krennic, someone Krennic could bring into the mix who would become important to the ultimate plot.",
