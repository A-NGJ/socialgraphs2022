 "content": "Priam was an Imperial Admiral in 0 ABY who was sent to the planet Troska with a commendation for Lieutenant Treyz Manech, who had uncovered the corruption of the Kyber family and the rogue Imperial officer Sev Buzk.\nTroska was a minor Outer Rim planet that only warranted a small Imperial outpost. Commander Buzk was illegally exploiting the natives, for his own personal gain. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Lieutenant Manech reported Buzk's illegal actions, and developed a plan to expose his corruption and expand the Imperial presence in the system. Admiral Priam and her colleagues approved Manech's plan and agreed to grant him the resources needed to carry it out. When it succeeded, the Admiral traveled to Troska to congratulate Manech, and give him new orders.\nAdmiral Priam was created by writer Jeremy Barlow, and drawn by Francisco Ruiz Velasco, though was not identified until given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. To date, the character has only appeared in Boba Fett: Overkill, a one-shot comic.",
