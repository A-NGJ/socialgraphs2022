 "content": "Daria Thul was a Human female member of House Thul and the daughter of Stanel Andaren Thul.\nIn 3643 BBY, Daria led an Inspection team during the Alderaan Civil War until they were captured by the Killiks. Her father, Stanel Thul, sent an imperial combatant to find the Inspection team. However, by the time the combatant reached Daria Thul, she had already become a joiner of the Ukanaku nest and introduced herself as \"New-Child\". She did not wish to return to her father. The Imperial however forced Daria to do so and the hive let her go over fear of retaliation.\nThe player is given the choice to either take Daria Thul back to her father  or to leave her with the hive .",
