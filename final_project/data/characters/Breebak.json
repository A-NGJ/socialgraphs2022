 "content": "Breebak was a Bonbrak who worked alongside the Jedi Padawan Ram Jomaram in a garage on the planet Valo during the High Republic Era. When Jomaram investigated a fault in the local communications tower with his droid, V-18, shortly before the opening of the Republic Fair, Breebak and the fellow Bonbrak Tip stowed away. Jomaram discovered that Nihil marauders had sabotaged the tower, and the two Bonbraks emerged after V-18 was damaged by the raiders, repairing the droid. Before Jomaram and the group could return to Lonisa City and spread word of the Nihil presence, they were arrested by the Valo Security Force. Valo was attacked by the Nihil, and Jomaram and his companions, joined by Padawan Lula Talisola and the Force-sensitive Zeen Mrala, set out to repair the communications tower.",
