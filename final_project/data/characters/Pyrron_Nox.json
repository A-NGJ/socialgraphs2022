 "content": "Pyrron Nox was a male spacer and trader. Nox was friends with fellow spacers Faris and Wrune Tsallin; enough so that Tsallin entrusted Nox with renewing his Bureau of Ships and Services license while he was working for Jatayus Outbound. During Nox's visit to the BoSS office, Faris told Nox that Jatayus was a front for Black Sun. Nox didn't believe it, or the rumors that Black Sun was controlled by a Dark Prince. As Nox attempted to renew Tsallin's license, he learned from the clerk, Lommbo, that Tsallin had been found dead, floating in the Ac'fren Spur.\nNox was also an acquaintance of Gideon, Cleven, and the Trianii Keeta. When Vandolae, a member of the shape-shifting Shi'ido species, impersonated Nox, Gideon discovered the ruse and shot the impostor.",
