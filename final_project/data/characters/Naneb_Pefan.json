 "content": "Naneb Pefan was an Ithorian trader and co-pilot.\nAs a trader, Naneb Pefan obtained a good amount of experience and skill, being supposedly able to sell sand on Tatooine.\nPefan was then hired by the Devaronian merchant Vacasor to co-pilot his ship, the Merasy. While Vacasor was a poor trader, he remained in business though the considerable business skills of Pefan. For example, Vacasor neglected the maintenance of his ship but insisted on exploring routes with little security and high piracy; Pefan was the one insisting on replacing the shields of the ship.",
