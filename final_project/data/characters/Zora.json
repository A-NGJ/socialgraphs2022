 "content": "Zora, also known as Wraith, was a female Mirialan who was a member of the Havoc Squad before defecting to the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nZora was a member of Havoc Squad and second-in-command to Harron Tavus. She was the team's infiltration and assassination expert. During the war, she was stationed on Ord Mantell during a civil war, fighting the Imperial-backed Mantellian Separatist Movement, where she and her squad, except an unidentified Republic Trooper, prepared and carried out their defection to the Sith Empire. Her position in Havoc Squad was filled by Aric Jorgan, soon after she defected.\nAfterwards, Wraith captured Senator Zorin Krasul and took him to Port Raga to force him to confess to the Senate abandoning Havoc Squad on Ando Prime. The new Havoc Squad was able to rescue the Senator, though Wraith escaped, and went on to systematically eliminating the individual Havoc traitors' operations on Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Alderaan. These constant failures annoyed the Empire, forcing Harron Tavus to call all the Republic traitors to the Imperial warship Justice. Havoc Squad infiltrated the ship, though Wraith caught them attempting to sabotage the hyperdrive. She died in the ensuing firefight.",
