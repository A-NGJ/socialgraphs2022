 "content": "Gorth was a Rodian who served on the CR90 corvette Candor as an officer in the fleet of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Between 2 BBY and 4 ABY. Gorth was present on the starship when it was attacked by an Imperial-class Star Destroyer.\nAfter the Star Destroyer fired against the Candor, an officer asked Gorth for a damage report. The Rodian, however, replied that the whole bridge was compromised. The Candor eventually managed to escape under the command of Captain Amilyn Holdo. The Rodian had blue eyes, green skin, and wore a gray uniform.\nGorth appeared in the comic story \"The Bridge,\" published by Marvel Comics in the one-shot comic Age of Resistance Special 1 on July 31, 2019. The story was written by Chris Eliopoulos and illustrated by Elsa Charretier and Nick Filardi.",
