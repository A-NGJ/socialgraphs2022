 "content": "Ark ol Loor was a Force-sensitive female Phydolon who was alive during the Imperial Era. At one point, she sought revenge against the Devaronian bounty hunter known as the \"Executioner\" for killing her significant other, Alk ol Nojj. Before she could kill the Executioner, she was stopped by an old human man who neutralized the bounty hunter's Dowutin bodyguards. The man offered to train Loor in the ways of the Force and she accepted.",
