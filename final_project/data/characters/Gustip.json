 "content": "Gustip was a Drall male who served as majordomo to the billionaire businessman and crime lord, Baron Benton Kaldo. Gustip oversaw the day-to-day operation and bookkeeping of Kaldo's criminal enterprises on Centerpoint Station, both in the upscale Hollowtown and the seedier Null Town.\nGustip was very meticulous and always carried himself with the bearing of an aristocrat. He regularly wore a white suit of a style that matched his employer and was never without his aurodium-plated cane. Whenever he traveled outside of Baron Kaldo's estates, he surrounded himself with a gang of Selonians.\nGus first appears in Suns of Fortune, a source book for Fantasy Flight Games' Edge of the Empire roleplaying game that was released in 2014.",
