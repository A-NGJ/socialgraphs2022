 "content": "Jonato was a human male who was a general in the Resistance during their war against the First Order. He was stationed on the Resistance Camp on Anoat after the Battle of Crait.\nGeneral Jonato was a prudent man who worried greatly of what was left of the Resistance. He saw Leia Organa as an integral part of the rebellious group's survival in the galaxy, yet was sympathetic enough to cease what may be insensitive comments on Organa's personal losses.",
