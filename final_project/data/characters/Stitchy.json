 "content": "Stitchy was a Gungan doctor from Naboo. Prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire, Stitchy served as court physician for Queen Apailana. Losing his job during the Imperial occupation, Stitchy went on to become the medic for champion shockboxer Lobar Aybock.\nStitchy was created by What's The Story? author Edward M. Erdelac for his official Star Wars authorial debut in the Hyperspace-exclusive short story Fists of Ion. According to Erdelac, Stitchy's name came from cutman Jacob \"Stitch\" Duran of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\nApailana was confirmed as Stitchy's former employer in Ed Erdelac's blog on StarWars.com, after being referred to as \"Apa-something\" in \"Fists of Ion.\"",
