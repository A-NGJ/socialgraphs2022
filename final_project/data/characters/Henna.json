 "content": "Henna was a Bothan jeweler who ran the jewelery company Bothawui Jewellers at some point between the years 1 ABY and 3 ABY. The business was set up on the floating mining colony of Cloud City in the atmosphere of the planet Bespin, in the Market Row commercial corridor in Cloud City's Port Town district. Henna was married to another Bothan jeweler named Cidri, and the pair operated the business together out of a weathered JumpMaster 5000 starship.\nHenna first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game. The jeweler is listed as a merchant players can purchase goods from, but no specific interactions are listed and the Bothan's gender is not stated.",
