 "content": "Aden was a Human male lieutenant of the Galactic Empire.\nHe was ambitious, and believed that he was on the rise in the Empire, but he was posted to Vanishing Place, a secret prison facility on Felucia, to keep him out of the way. This was possibly a result of his violent temper, which had resulted in him being transferred out of a number of units by their commanders, because he would demonstrate his loyalty to the Empire by berating fellow officers for even minor offences. He served on Felucia as Captain Vischera's second-in-command when an Alderaanian Resistance team attacked the facility.",
