 "content": "A male Kaleesh was the father of Xivhkalrainik, who was enslaved and captured by the Sith Empire, but managed to become a Sith apprentice to Lord Kallig. Xivhkalrainik  kept in contact with his father, who was a husband to several wives, and who ultimately passed away during his son's apprenticeship to Kallig. Xalek was allowed to give his father a proper burial on Ilum so he could ascend to godhood.\nAround 3631 BBY Xalek, now a Sith Lord, visited his father's shrine on Ilum, to discover it had been desecrated by miners. Enraged, Xalek began a campaign of terror and revenge against them, eventually coming face-to-face with the Commander, who helped him restore his father's honor.\nXivhkalrainik's father is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Xalek companion storyline.",
