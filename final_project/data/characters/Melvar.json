 "content": "General Melvar was the right-hand man of Warlord Zsinj.\nA Human male originally from Kuat, carrying a common Human surname, Melvar was a fanatical follower of Emperor Palpatine. He had what was labeled \"Patriotic psychosis\", an obsessive love of the Galactic Empire.\nHe was part of Destab, but was removed from the field as a \"tactical liability\" and placed with IntCon and assigned to the Iron Fist.\nWhen Zsinj went rogue, Melvar became his top General, though he was rather young at the time. He would often sneak up on Zsinj, something which the warlord found irritating at the most. Much like Zsinj, he enjoyed using deceit against his foes—his features, normally bland and nondescript  could be made to look savage and sadistic. Gara Petothel said he had \"the cruelest features ever seen on a Human being.\"\nMelvar was also depicted as being extremely sadistic, having his fingernails removed and replaced with cuticle implants to provide him with an immediate torture device that also gave him multiple facial scars. It was unclear if these nails and scars were real or part of one of his acts—his features were always bland around the warlord and the nails were only seen in the presence of his enemies.\nHe was also involved with Zsinj's intelligence divisions. When Han Solo was captured by the Nightsisters, Melvar went down to take formal possession of Solo, along with a transport shuttle to take the Nightsisters off Dathomir. Gethzerion thanked him in a unique way—giving him a simple death.",
