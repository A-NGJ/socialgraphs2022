 "content": "Clode Rhoden owned and governed the gas giant planet of Yorn Skot in the years prior to the Battle of Naboo. Roden made millions of credits from mining tibanna from the Yorn Skot mining station, but also made a number of enemies. He was married to Madam Rhoden, and knew of her affair with the eco-terrorist, Buck. Rhoden also owned the luxury liner, Aurorient Express.\nIn 38 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi went on a mission to save the Aurorient Express from sinking into the gas giant. They discovered that Rhoden was plotting to kill his wife by sending her in an escape pod into the Station and destroying it, then collecting insurance money by blaming the destruction on the Green Forge terrorist group.\nThe Station was eventually saved from destruction, although Rhoden lost it to Saul Moegantz by gambling.",
