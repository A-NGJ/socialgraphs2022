 "content": "Hurm was a Human farmer during the Clone Wars.\nHurm, along with Starmer and two other men infiltrated an ark starship  with the intention of taking over the ship to transport the animals to Hurm's homeworld, which had petitioned the Galactic Republic months earlier for the receival of farm creatures as well, but got no reply.\nUnbeknownst to them, the ship was being manned by Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who effectively foiled their plans and imprisoned them. Upon the arrival on one of the terraformed worlds, Tano instead of arresting them, gave them newborn animals for them to breed and take back to their home planet.\nHurm had a careful nature and was initially reluctant to engage in a fight with Ahsoka, preferring a legal way to resolve their planet's farm animal shortage.",
