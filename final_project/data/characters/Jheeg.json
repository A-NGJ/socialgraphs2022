 "content": "Jheeg was a male Arcona who lived on Nal Hutta during the Cold War. He worked as a paid contact for Imperial Intelligence, keeping tabs on the criminal underworld and, when necessary, supplying Intelligence agents with false identities. His security clearance within the organization, however, was very low.\nDuring the Cold War, Jheeg provided an Imperial Agent, later known as Cipher Nine, a cover identity as the pirate, the Red Blade, to infiltrate Nem'ro the Hutt's organization. However, as soon as Nine's mission was complete, Jheeg informed the agent that the real Red Blade was on Hutta searching for his impostor, and advised haste in intercepting Blade.\nThe former Minister of Intelligence would later use Jheeg's name as a cover when contacting Cipher Nine on the planet Rishi.",
