 "content": "Anna was a female Cathar miner. In 3631 BBY she was part of the mining group working on Ilum for the Minos-Mestra Corporation, who secured the minings rights from both Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. After the miners accidentally desecrated a burial cite of Xivhkalrainik's father, his son, the Sith Lord Xalek began attacking their mining camps, slaughtering everyone and leaving no survivors. When Anna was at Shaft 12, Xalek attacked it and began killing everyone. Anna contacted Shaft 16 for help, but by the time it arrived, she was already dead.\nAnna appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during Xalek Alliance alert mission.",
