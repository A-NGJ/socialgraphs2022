 "content": "General Rand Talor was a Rebel officer who participated in the Liberation of Coruscant. Having lost his wife, Kath Talor, to Imperial Tal Ashen, he managed to liberate the Imperial Palace and find her imprisoned.\nRand Talor was voiced by John Cygan in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns.\nStar Wars: Force Commander also features the Liberation of Coruscant, but in that game the assault on the Imperial Palace is commanded by Brenn Tantor. The most likely explanation is that the two commanded separate, simultaneous assaults from different directions, or that Talor commanded the force from the ground while Tantor issued him orders from orbit via the BHCI. This arrangement was used between Tantor and Veers during the Battle of Hoth.",
