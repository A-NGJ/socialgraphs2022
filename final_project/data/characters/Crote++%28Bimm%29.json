 "content": "Crote was a Bimm who served as a go-between when the Empire commissioned a group of bounty hunters to track down Han Solo and Leia Organa after the Battle of Hoth. Crote was to contact the elusive hunter known as Nariss Siv Loqesh and inform him that the Empire required his services. Nariss refused and asked the Bimm to tell the Empire that he had disappeared. Crote did so, resulting in a twenty-five thousand credit bounty on the hunter.",
