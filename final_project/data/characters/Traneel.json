 "content": "Traneel was a male Human who served as a commander in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 3 ABY, Commander Traneel was hiding aboard drone vessel 171 with several stormtroopers as part of a plan devised by Darth Vader to capture Rebels. When Raptor Squad of the Rebel Alliance arrived to steal the drone freighter, the commander came out of hiding along with his troops to make them prisoners. However, Traneel was knocked unconscious by Lando Calrissian, who took his Imperial officer's uniform and used it to command his soldiers.\nCalrissian ordered the Imperial troops to follow him to the aft docking bay of the freighter and locked them up there. Luke Skywalker then used a mind trick on the stormtroopers to convince them to get to the escape pods and abandon ship. The Rebels captured the vessel and made their jump to lightspeed, presumably with Traneel still on board.",
