 "content": "Grubbat Fhilch was a Lepi with blue-gray fur, long ears, and a long bushy tail.\nGrubbat embezzled money from Jabba Desilijic Tiure's podracing betting operation, causing the Hutt to put a bounty on Fhilch's head.\nBoba Fett took the bounty, tracked him down to his home warren, and took him back to Tatooine. There, he was executed by being thrown into a sarlacc. Before being cast into the sarlacc, he swore revenge on Fett. Since Fett was later swallowed by another sarlacc, and that sarlacc was born from a spore cast from the one which ate Fhilch, he could be said to have had his revenge after all.\nThe name \"Grubbat\" was used in the The Starhoppers of Aduba-3 article as an example of a Lepi name, and in this manner Fhilch's species was revealed. However, unlike most Lepi, such as Jaxxon, Fhilch has a long, bushy tail.",
