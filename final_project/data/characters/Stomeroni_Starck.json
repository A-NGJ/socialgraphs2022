 "content": "Stomeroni Starck was a human male who flew as an T-70 X-wing starfighter pilot and Flight Officer in the Resistance fleet. He served as Blue Two. Starck often served under Blue Leader Lieutenant Tallissan Lintra, who appreciated his skill as a pilot, but had to work to keep his impulsive, headstrong nature in check. Flying as Lintra's wingmate in the Battle of D'Qar, Starck bought time for the evacuation of the Resistance base and covered the Resistance's MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 bombers in their attack run on the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix. Preparing to launch from the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus following the discovery that the fleet had been tracked through hyperspace, Starck was killed when Kylo Ren's personal squadron destroyed the cruiser's main hangar.\nStomeroni Starck wore an interstellar-orange flight suit that had a utility belt, and emergency oxygen tube. The suit was further covered in a white flight vest and was accompanied by a gray Guidenhauser flight harness, a white FreiTek life support unit, black gloves and boots. Signal flares were strapped above his left ankle. He wore a red and white flight helmet, with a black and red checkered pattern on top.\nStomeroni Starck was portrayed by Noah Segan in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was released on December 15, 2017. The character's surname was revealed in the film's credits, while his first name was given in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.",
