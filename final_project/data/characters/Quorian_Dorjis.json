 "content": "Quorian Dorjis was a Human male Jedi that served the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the Sith Empire. He was once sent on a mission to infiltrate the Sith Academy on Korriban which he failed and eventually was captured.\nThrough drugs and sorcery, Inquisitor Urinth, managed to manipulate his mind so he would think that he had gathered important information on Sith plans. One acolyte was then assigned to gain his trust and set him free discretely, so he would return to the Jedi Order with the false information without questioning.",
