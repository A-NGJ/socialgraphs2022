He was stationed on Hoth around 3642 BBY, when he was killed.\nDootu Mu Bacha appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Hoth. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
