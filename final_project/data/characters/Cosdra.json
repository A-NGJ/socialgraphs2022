 "content": "Cosdra was a Twi'lek female who served as a loyal member of the White Worms gang on the planet Corellia. She worked as a sentry for the gang's den in Coronet City, and in 13 BBY, she was present when the scrumrat Han escaped from the gang's leader, Lady Proxima.\nCosdra was Twi'lek female from the planet Corellia who served as a scrumrat in the White Worms gang of Coronet City. By the time that she was one of the older scrumrats in the gang, Cosdra's loyalty had earned her a number of perks, including sentry duty near the surface of Den of the White Worms, which allowed her access to slightly fresher air then most other gang members.\nIn the year 13 BBY, Cosdra was present in the den when fellow scrumrat Han was brought before Lady Proxima, leader of the gang. Han, who had returned from a trade with no goods for Proxima, claimed to be holding a Thermal detonator above his head, at which point Cosdra got down on her knees for cover. However, Han actually only held a rock, which he used to break a shutter behind the gang leader and bathe her in light, which burned her skin. Using the distraction, Han then pushed through the other scrumrats and escaped.\nCosdra was a loyal member of the White Worms with orange skin and brown eyes.\nCosdra wore dark gray brine-stained robes with gray pants and wrist wraps as well as gray and red head wrappings. She made use of a breather mask and used a white pipe as a makeshift weapon.\nCosdra first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. The character was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.",
