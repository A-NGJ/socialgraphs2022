 "content": "Nirame Sakute was a male Rodian that lived during the Galactic Civil War. He served the Lok Revenants as a trainer and often worked with the Smugglers' Alliance. After the Battle of Yavin, Nirame was working from the cantina in the Trade Outpost on Dathomir.\nDuring his time at the Trade Outpost on Dathomir, Sakute wore a military travel pack, a red leather trim shirt with black colored trim, a silver colored padded armor belt, a red decorative skirt, and black women's shoes.\nNirame Sakute was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Nirame Sakute was added to the game with the release of the space expansion pack Jump to Lightspeed, on October 27, 2004.\nIn the game, Nirame Sakute had the appearance of a female Rodian and wore woman clothes. However, all conversation clearly identified him as a male.",
