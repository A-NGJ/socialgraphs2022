 "content": "Mundokk was a male Trandoshan bounty hunter from the moon of Wasskah who worked during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign. He held an Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate, but at some point it came into the possession of Bossk, another Trandoshan bounty hunter. Bossk later used the license to access the Imperial Enforcement DataCore in a posting agency on the planet Lothal. When questioned by the street urchin Ezra Bridger as to who Mundokk was, Bossk claimed the other hunter no longer needed the certificate. Mundokk had a heavily scarred muzzle.\nMundokk was first mentioned in Ezra's Gamble, a junior novel written by Ryder Windham and released in 2014.",
