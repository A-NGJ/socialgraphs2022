 "content": "Fume Pachoola was a wealthy Wroonian male aristocrat who lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. Due to his grandfather having amassed a large fortune, Fume never had to work and he lived a life of luxury. He was the father to Pelf Pachoola and after she became engaged, he gave her two Kobarian swamp dogs, Higgs and Twiggs, as a wedding present. After Fume and Pelf undertook a cruise aboard the liner Salin Mariner, they were kidnapped and held hostage by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. However, Fume refused to pay the pirate anything and the Weequay was unable to secure a ransom for their release, so he eventually let the Wroonians go, by forcing a passing delivery freighter to take them off his hands.",
