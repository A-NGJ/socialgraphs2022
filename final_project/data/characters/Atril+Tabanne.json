 "content": "Atril Tabanne of Coruscant was a Human female officer in the New Republic Defense Fleet. She was a graduate of the Imperial Academy, and was a TIE/LN starfighter pilot before defecting to the Rebel Alliance.\nIn 7 ABY, Tabanne held the rank of Lieutenant, and was assigned as executive officer of the captured CR90 corvette Night Caller. As Wraith Squadron had a limited number of pilots qualified in TIE fighters, Atril's experience in that regard meant that she was used as a pilot as well as a bridge officer. When Captain Choday Hrakness was killed in the Battle of Talasea, Tabanne took command of the Night Caller and was promoted to Captain. She temporarily relinquished command to Wedge Antilles during the Battle of Ession, in which she led Wraith Squadron's TIE fighter contingent in his place, but resumed command afterward.",
