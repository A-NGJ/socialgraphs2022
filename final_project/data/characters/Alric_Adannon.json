 "content": "Alric Adannon was a male Human Lord of House Cadriaan. He represented his house in the annual inter-house Vor-cal safari hunt in which he once came second. Lord Adannon was a loud and arrogant man who was angered when his house Privy council disinvited him from representing Cadriaan at the Vor-cal shortly before the battle of Endor. He had broad shoulders and often wore a reptilian hide cloak that he claimed was from a Krayt dragon but was in reality from a Rodian Swamp Lizard.",
