 "content": "Aedalus was a tame convor from the jungle moon Wasskah. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, it was offered for sale as a pet by the vendor droid 80-T5, who ran a stall in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. Aedalus had gray and yellow feathers and yellow skin, with black eyes.\nAedalus first appeared as a purchasable companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010 and shut down in 2014. The convor could be bought for 350 station cash, a premium in-game currency players had to buy with real money. Given that Aedalus's purchase was entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about if it was bought.",
