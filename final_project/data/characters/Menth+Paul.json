 "content": "Menth Paul was a treasure hunter who resided in the Mensix Mining Facility cantina on Mustafar.\nWhile exploring the vast world of Mustafar, Menth came across a mysterious shard. After picking it up, he seemed to be cursed, suffering much misfortune. Menth wanted to go home and be rid of the shard, but could not afford a ticket off Mustafar. One day, he came across a spacer and offered to sell him the shard so he could afford the ticket. The spacer agreed and Menth purchased a ticket offworld, leaving the shard in the hands of a spacer. Some say the spacer suffered bad luck, attacked by swarms of lava fleas not long after the purchase, others say he destroyed the shard by throwing it into the lava.\nMenth Paul appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
