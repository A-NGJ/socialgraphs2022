 "content": "Garginoolaara, or Gargi for short, grew up in the Roche asteroid field. Many of his modifications were deemed too dangerous, even for the Verpine themselves, and he was cast out by his hive. He wandered the galaxy until he met Fiz Cor'gril, who recognized his abilities and hired him to work in his starship dealership. He kept Fizzi's merchandise in top condition, and sometimes a little better than that.\nHe had a natural inquisitiveness and inventiveness that led him to tinker more than his peers. Gargi was quiet and kept to himself mostly, although he was friendly with Shanna Kinn and the droid R5-M1.",
