 "content": "Cole Darba was a Human male member of the Citizens' Militia during the Cold War.\nIn 3643 BBY, Darba and his men had been stationed at Manister Base, which had become overrun by a hive of Geonosians from the nearby planet Geonosis. While holed up in one of the base's buildings, he was found by a Republic spacer. Darba didn't believe that he and his men would withstand another assault, but the spacer told him that they would push back the Geonosians while the militiamen fled to Outpost Largona to the south.",
