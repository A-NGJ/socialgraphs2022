 "content": "Commander Zalin Bey was a Human female who served in the Senate Guard during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nDuring her career, Zalin was very loyal to the Galactic Republic and was once partners with Sagoro Autem, but was promoted instead of him due to his desire to keep away from a desk job. She got the popularity and thus increased from active duty to the future to take on various administrative tasks.\nIn 23 BBY, Zalin later commanded the Guard unit that Autem and his new partner, Isaru Omin, were assigned to. Her unit was assigned the task of investigating the murder of Senator Jheramahd Greyshade. While Sagoro and Isaru went on the search for the bomber, Zalin investigated inside a laboratory where she searched for evidence. She soon discovered that Venco Autem was responsible for the murder.",
