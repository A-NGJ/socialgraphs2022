 "content": "Raine was a male Cathar soldier living during the war against Zakuul. He was a member of the Eternal Alliance and was part of the Alliance Recon Unit, created and deployed in response to various uprisings sparkling across the galaxy following the death of the Eternal Empire, Empress Vaylin and reorganization of the Alliance into the Eternal Alliance. Along with the rest of the unit Raine participated in such crises as reclaiming the stolen plans for the Alliance base from the Dust Vipers pirates, liberating Port Nowhere from the Crimson Fang takeover and neutralizing Sith Lords Adacin and Zanisk in the former Separatist stronghold on Ord Mantell. Eventually, during the attack on Denova by General Amos Rike and his forces, the unit's shuttle was shot down and crashed, nearly killing Raine and injuring the other members.\nRaine appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during various Uprisings.",
