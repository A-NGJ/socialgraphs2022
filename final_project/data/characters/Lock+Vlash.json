 "content": "Lock Vlash was a male Rodian who lived on Corellia during the Galactic Civil War.\nLock Vlash once joined the Corellian sect known as the Followers of Nyax. However, he finally managed to leave the Cult. Although he successfully escaped, Vlash remained worried that some cultists could try to take revenge on him. Furthermore, the relations between Vlash and the Cult deteriorated even more when the former intended to sell the location of the Lord Nyax's Cult hideout. In 1 ABY, Lock Vlash met a spacer in the city of Tyrena and agreed to share the location of Lord Nyax's Cult hideout, but also the location of the Afarathu Cave and the Imperial Stronghold.\nLock Vlash was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.Lock Vlash was added to the game with the \"Publish 5\" update, released on December 16, 2003.",
