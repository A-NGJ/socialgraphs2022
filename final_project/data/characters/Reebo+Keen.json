 "content": "Reebo Keen was a Human male who moved to Ostor and became one of the leaders of the group of Separatists there. Earlier in his life, he was an adventurer and discovered two star systems. A few months after the Clone Wars ended which resulted the birth of the Galactic Empire, the Imperials launched a military offensive to suppress the influence of the separatists on Ostor. Keen and the other separatist leaders helped set up a defense strategy. This allowed the separatist general Atticus Farstar to almost completely wipe out a first wave of the empire. However, the defense did not stand up to a second wave of attacks, and Keen and the other leaders perished during the course of the battle.",
