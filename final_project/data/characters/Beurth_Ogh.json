 "content": "Beurth Ogh was a Gamorrean male camera operator who, alongside journalist Kandra Nilitz, who was on assignment for Landing Zone NewsNet at the Galactic Senate Rotunda during the Jedi coup of the Galactic Alliance. Ogh later joined Nilitz when she smuggled the insane Jedi Knights Jysella and Valin Horn off of Coruscant in exchange for an exclusive news story. After arriving on Nam Chorios, the Horns abandoned Kandra and Beurth. Beurth went with Kandra as she interviewed Snaplaunce, the mayor of Hweg Shul, who revealed that the Skywalkers could not have stabbed him as they had already taken off in his ship, Vote Snaplaunce. Kandra then sent communications to Luke Skywalker to meet up with her in exchange for a ride. When the Skywalkers and Vestara Khai arrived, they were attacked by three Sith, but the Jedi and Vestara were able to defeat them. In exchange for a ride, Luke told Kandra and Beurth about Abeloth and the Lost Tribe of Sith.",
