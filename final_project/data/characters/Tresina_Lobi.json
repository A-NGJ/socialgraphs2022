 "content": "Tresina Lobi was a female Chev Jedi Master during the war against the Yuuzhan Vong. She had a noted ability for blending into crowds.\nDuring the Yuuzhan Vong War, Lobi was training Thrynni Vae as her apprentice. When Vae went missing on a mission to Duro a year into the conflict, she sought out Luke Skywalker to help find her. Sadly, it was discovered that Vae had been killed by the treacherous Peace Brigade. Despite the loss of her apprentice, Lobi was still able to determine that supplies for refugees on Duro were being scuttled to the floating Urrdorf City.\nFour years into the war, she was chosen by Master Skywalker to sit on the High Council, where she was a strong voice for the New Jedi Order. During the final battle against the Yuuzhan Vong on Yuuzhan'tar, Lobi was one of many Jedi to defend Zonama Sekot from Alpha Red.\nFive years after the war, Lobi went to find the Dark Nest with Leia and Han Solo, and fought against the Gorog Killiks on Kr. She sided with Corran Horn during the debate on whether he should take control of the Jedi Order in Luke's absence. During the final phase of the Killik expansion, Lobi led a StealthX squadron of Jedi fighters against Lomi Plo and her Dark Nest where she suffered crash burns. It is unknown if this was a result of a crash.\nDuring the Second Galactic Civil War, Lobi was assigned to watch Ben Skywalker closely; particularly after it was learned that Lumiya had returned. Lobi's task led her to the Fellowship Plaza in the heart of Coruscant's Senatorial District, where she eavesdropped on a conversation between Jacen Solo and Ben Skywalker, followed shortly after by a revealing conversation between Jacen Solo and Lumiya.\nBefore she could complete the transmission to Luke that Lumiya was after Ben, she was detected by Alema Rar, who was also eavesdropping on Jacen Solo. A fierce duel occurred in which Lobi severed Lumiya's cybernetic arm and was able to hold her own against the two women. Lumiya and Rar eventually overwhelmed the Jedi Master; once Lumiya's lightwhip severed her legs from behind, Lobi was swiftly decapitated by Rar, who felt the Jedi Master had fought well and suffered enough. Her body was found the next morning by a gardener droid.\nIn 44 ABY, Grand Master Luke Skywalker glimpsed Lobi in the Lake of Apparitions while seeking his deceased wife Mara Jade Skywalker, but did not stop to talk with her.\nLobi was mistakenly identified and described as a Chevin in The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way. The 2002 Star Wars Insider article Who's Who in the New Jedi Order stated that Lobi was the first Chev to develop Force-sensitivity. However, this was later overruled by the 2004 role-playing adventure A Mon Alone, which featured a Force-sensitive Chev named Drik, who was active during the Clone Wars.",
