 "content": "Darth Rictus was a Dark Lord of the Sith and member of the reconstituted Sith Empire's Dark Council. As head of the Sphere of Mysteries, Rictus held the title of Keeper of Mysteries.\nBy 3640 BBY, Rictus was the oldest member of the Council, even older than the 76-year-old Darth Vowrawn. It was because of this that his opinion of matters was well-respected by the other Councilors. He also believed that aliens did not have a place on the Dark Council, asking Darth Marr if he was afraid of Karrid.\nAfter Darth Karrid killed Darth Gravus in an attempt to earn Darth Hadra's now-vacant Dark Council seat, Rictus changed his tune and spoke in support of her, saying that she has acted like a true Sith.\nIn the midst of the Dread Masters crisis, Rictus initiated the founding of the Dread Executioners to eliminate the Dread Masters, whose base of operations was discovered on Oricon.\nDarth Rictus's status following the Eternal Empire conquest was unknown. It is possible he was either killed or fled into hiding, as only Darth Acina and Darth Vowrawn were present on the council following the war. His sphere was later merged into the Sphere of Sith Doctrine, which was led by Darth Anathel.\nThe Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel quest \"An Invitation From Darth Acina\" is named in the game's files as \"An Invitation From Darth Rictus.\"",
