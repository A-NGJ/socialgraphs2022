 "content": "Ratrin Vhek was known to frequent the moon Nar Shaddaa.\nWhen Meetra Surik arrived on Nar Shaddaa in 3951 BBY, Vhek claimed to be a former owner of the Ebon Hawk, stating that it had been stolen from him a short time before the end of the Mandalorian Wars. He backed up his claim by reciting some of the vessel's rather secret technical details, including the location of some hidden compartments.\nHe was killed by Cahhmakt when trying to board the Ebon Hawk during the Red Eclipse assault, so the ship remained in Surik's possession.\nIn material cut from the game, the Red Eclipse slavers would keep Vhek alive, after he claimed to be the owner of the ship. They held him in the security room with Cahhmakt. Once Meetra slew all of the slavers, Ratrin would say that since the ship attracts so much attention now, he doesn't want it back, and leaves the ship.\nAlternatively, the player can give Vhek to the Red Eclipse as a slave. He protests, to which Cahhmakt coldly replies \"Slaves do not talk.\"",
