 "content": "Raklo-Mo was a Voss Mystic living on Voss shortly after his planet was discovered by the galactic society. He saw a vision of Republic and Empire posing a mortal threat to Voss, which the interpreters had deemed false. Raklo-Mo stood on a platform called the Step of Harmony and threatened to take a step out of Voss-Ka onto the cliffs below, which led the Three to retraining the interpreters, who this time correctly identified his vision as a threat to Voss culture, not the planet itself. Raklo-Mo recorded the event in the Writings of Raklo-Mo on a carving outside the Shrine of Healing in the Old Paths.",
