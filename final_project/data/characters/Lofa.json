 "content": "Lofa was a male Human smuggler who was active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire A friend of the Republic, Lofa could be found aboard the space station Carrick Station.\nLofa appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as the first-tier endgame PvE gear vendor for the Smuggler class; his actual title has varied as the tier has been relabeled over the game's history. He was later removed as a vendor and NPC in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system. Nonetheless, he remains in the game, as his character model is used as part of the background environment in the redesigned fleet areas.",
