 "content": "Barak was a member of the underworld who tasked smugglers to deliver crates of contraband to various sources.\nDuring 1 ABY, Barak resided in the Bestine township on Tatooine. He once heard of a noteworthy smuggler, and sent the smuggler an e-mail requesting their assistance. The smuggler agreed to meet up with Barak to get some work. Barak had the smuggler deliver contraband to various individuals, including Kaleb, Diala, Jalen, Sarlin and Kara.\nBarak was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Barak was added to the game along with the Smuggling Missions introduced with the update named \"Chapter 3: Smugglers and Scoundrels\", released on September 27, 2006.",
