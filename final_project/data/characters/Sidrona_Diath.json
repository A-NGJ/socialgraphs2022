 "content": "Sidrona Diath was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order up until his death in the Battle of Basilisk in 4017 BBY.\nA Human Force-sensitive, Sidrona Diath settled on the Outer Rim planet, Tatooine during the era of the Old Sith Wars. Receiving training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, Diath eventually attained the rank of Jedi Master. During this time, Diath fathered a son named Dace, whom he raised on his homeworld in the ways of the Jedi. The younger Diath would eventually attain the rank of Jedi Knight and study the ways of the Force on Ossus. Sidrona Diath would utter the immortal words \"Koroght gaghgt Takt\" in Tusken to the Jedi High Council before leaving the Coruscant Jedi Temple to fight in the Great Sith War, disagreeing with their approach to the war effort. The nearest Basic translation was \"Blessed be your going out from us.\"\nIn 4017 BBY, Master Diath took to the front lines of Basilisk to do battle with the Mandalorians. During the fighting, Diath was killed by the enemy, his body returned to the Jedi Temple for funeral preparations.\nSidrona Diath's body was returned to his homeworld and buried in accordance to local tradition. In 32 BBY, several millennium after Diath's death, members of the Jedi High Council recalled the famed Jedi Master's last words spoken to members of the Council of the era: \"Koroght gaghgt Takt.\" Master Eeth Koth reflected on these words during a discussion of the famed Jedi-turned-Tusken Sharad Hett.\nIn 1 ABY, Diath's ancient grave site was defaced by an anti-Jedi group. Some of his history would be chronicled by Alakai Trotter later in the Galactic Civil War.\nThe PC game Star Wars: Rebellion mistakenly states that Sidrona Diath was killed by the Sith at the Battle of Basilisk.",
