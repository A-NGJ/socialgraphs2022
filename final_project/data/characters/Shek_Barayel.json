 "content": "Shek Barayel was a male Indu serving as chief councillor on the Indu Council. He was murdered in an attempt by Imperial loyalists to frame the New Republic and bring the Empire  back to Indu San.\nDuring a vote covering an alliance between the Indu San system and the New Republic, Barayel was assassinated by Council Authority Officer Kaleb Darme. Darme had inconspicuously planted a bomb in Barayel's comm and voter panel at the council's U-shaped conference table. Darme was brought to justice by GNN reporter Kella Rand, who unknowingly caught his actions on hover-cam during an interview with Barayel's aide, Tev Aden.",
