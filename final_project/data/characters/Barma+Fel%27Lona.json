 "content": "Barma Fel'Lona was a female Rodian sabacc ringer working for the casino of the Sanads of Rorkee hotel. A quiet person, Fel'Lona was a hard worker, but she disliked her career for ethical reasons, and harbored some disdain toward her workmate Har Fuggaw for not sharing those same moral concerns. Fel'Lona would rather have worked as an actress in fantasy settings, but there were no job opportunities in that field for a Rodian in Rorkee. She would nevertheless had accepted a better job as a bribe in exchange for information.",
