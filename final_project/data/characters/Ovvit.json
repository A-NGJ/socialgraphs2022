 "content": "Ovvit was a male Chev pirate who worked as a pilot with the Boneyard Rendezvous. He was ordered by his captain, Byalfin Dyur, to kill Ben Skywalker following Lumiya's orders. Having hunted Ben and his companion, the child Kiara, Ovvit was killed when Ben lured the TIE fighter he was flying to the side of a ruined temple and then triggered a landslide which crushed the craft, killing the hapless pirate. Ben would later scavenge the TIE fighter for much needed supplies.",
