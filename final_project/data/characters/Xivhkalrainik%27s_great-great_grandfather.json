 "content": "Xivhkalrainik's great-great grandfather was a male Kaleesh living long before the Cold War. During the Kaleesh clan wars he and two of his wives led an outnumbered force to victory. In Kaleesh culture such exceptional deeds meant the Kaleesh would ascend to godhood after their deaths. Centuries after their deaths, the family of their descendants, including Xivhkalrainik, still prayed at their shrines.\nXivhkalrainik's great-great grandfather is mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Xalek companion storyline.",
