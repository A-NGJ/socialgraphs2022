 "content": "Lassin Dedge was a Human male who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nLassin Dedge appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. However, he is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
