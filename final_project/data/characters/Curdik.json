 "content": "Curdik was a male Whiphid swordsman.\nBorn mute on Toola, Curdik learned to communicate through his weapons and his datapad.\nIn the years after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Curdik worked as a scout for off-world hunters that visited Toola. Bored with serving tourists, Curdik left his homeworld and traveled the galaxy.\nEventually he made his way to Zuliria where the Arcona Ther-das noticed that he was a great swordsbeing and invited him to join the Zulirian Swordmasters. Curdik since was loyal to Ther-das, probably because Ther-das was the person who gave him a purpose, and has fought Ther-das enemies to allow the Arcona to continue with his studies.",
