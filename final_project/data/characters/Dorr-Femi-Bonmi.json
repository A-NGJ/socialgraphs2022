 "content": "Dorr-Femi-Bonmi was a corrupt Cerean male Elder from the planet Cerea who served as Senator in the Galactic Senate of the Republic.\nIn 33 BBY, he was involved in a conspiracy with the Chevin smuggler Ephant Mon to sell precious Cerean malium to Jabba Desilijic Tiure in exchange for banned technology, such as swoops. Secretly, he played the movement for information and sold illegal Cerea technologies. Dorr was one of the only Elders on the Council in favor of joining the Republic, and expected the influx of technology to win the people in his favor. After the death of Ydde, Dorr was arrested by his colleague Nar-Somo-Dali because of his corruption.",
