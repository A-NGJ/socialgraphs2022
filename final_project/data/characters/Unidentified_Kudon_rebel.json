 "content": "A Kudon rebel was part of a group of freedom fighters that operated on the planet Kudo during the reign of the Galactic Empire. The Alliance to Restore the Republic undertook a mission to Kudo in order to provide support to the Kudon rebels. After an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau was dispatched to investigate the local resistance, the visiting Rebel Alliance members were able to defeat the agent and delay the Empire. The Kudon rebel subsequently spoke with Princess Leia Organa, who, unsure how long of a delay had been achieved, offered them and their people a chance to evacuate with the Alliance forces. However, the Kudon declined, not wishing to give up on their world.",
