 "content": "This unidentified Balnab worked as a bounty hunter around 21 BBY, during the Clone Wars.\nThis bounty hunter was present along with two Weequays and a two Humans, also bounty hunters, in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine. They were scrolling through a list of the latest bounties when they came across Savage Opress and decided to take him, since he was worth the most credits. Asajj Ventress stepped in, however; and said that this one was for her.\nThis bounty hunter wore garments including a pale blue shirt and goggles over his eyes.",
