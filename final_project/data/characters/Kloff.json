 "content": "Kloff was a male Culroon who united the planet Culroon III and ended the continual conflict through the application of imported energy weapons.\nThe Culroon male Kloff was born on the planet Culroon III, a world with a long history of violence and war. Using imported energy weapons, Kloff managed to unite the fractured planet under his rule. When the Galactic Empire arrived, General Irrv attempted to attain the Culroon capitulation through a ceremony and exchange of symbolic weapons. During the ceremony, Kloff accepted a Naval sword from Irrv, and sheathed it in the General's aide, Colonel Jeffers, before signalling his warriors to attack. The Imperial force was rescued by the intervention of Junior Lieutenant Maximilian Veers and his All Terrain Armored Transport.",
