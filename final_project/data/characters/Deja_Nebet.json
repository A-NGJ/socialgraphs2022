 "content": "Deja Nebet was a female Human who served as the senator of the planet Onderon during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire.\nBorn on the planet of Onderon, Deja Nebet grew up as a staunch believer in the values of the Republic, while also being fiercely proud of her homeworld's traditions and people.\nBefore she became the planet's senator in the Galactic Senate, Nebet served as an officer of the Royal Guard of Queen Lina, the mother of the future King Regalun Petryph. During her service, legends say that she was one of two guards who made it out alive after fighting Wodnakki at Dox Piter. Nebet was injured in the battle and had to be carried to a nearby village by Lina for treatment, where she was greeted as a hero. This tale would later become a common story told to Onderonian children for years.\nDue to her longtime ties to the planet's nobility and royalty, alongside King Petryph's frequent seclusion and ineptitude, Nebet became the de facto political leader for the planet.",
