 "content": "Wyron Serper was a male human who served as a captain in the Alliance to Restore the Republic as the senior controller of the command center in the Alliance's Echo Base on the planet Hoth. In 3 ABY, he and the base's commander, General Carlist Rieekan discussed an unidentified blip that had been detected near the base with Princess Leia Organa and her companions Han Solo and Chewbacca.\nAfter Serper played a weak signal coming from the blip, Solo and Chewbacca left to investigate it and discovered it to be the Imperial Viper probe droid XJ9-CS14. The droid alerted the Empire to the Alliance's presence on Hoth, forcing the Alliance to evacuate as the Imperials attacked.\nThe human male Wyron Serper served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic as part of its fight against the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, Serper held the rank of captain and was serving as the senior controller in the command center of Echo Base, the Alliance's secret headquarters on the planet Hoth. Princess Leia Organa was perched next to Serper's station when the smuggler Han Solo informed General Carlist Rieekan, the base's commander, that he had to leave Hoth due to the price on his head. After saying a tense farewell to Organa, Solo bolted out of the center, and the princess stormed after him, all sense of duty to what she was helping Serper with forgotten.\nWhen the Alliance picked up an unidentified blip moving east past the base of Zone Twelve, Rieekan called Organa over to Serper's console in the command center, where the general and the controller were viewing the blip's movements near the base on a map. Rieekan explained the situation to Organa and her companions Han Solo and Chewbacca, with Serper adding that it was made of metal. Organa used this information to rule out the possibility of it being one of the predatory wampa they were dealing with, while Solo suggested it might be one of their own speeders. Serper denied this, then adjusted the controls on his headset and reported that they were getting a weak signal from the unidentified object, turning on an audio speaker so the others could hear it.\nThe protocol droid C-3PO then informed the group that the signal was not one used by the Alliance, suggesting it might be Imperial. Solo then left with Chewbacca to head out and locate the source of the signal, while Rieekan ordered Serper to have Rogue Ten and Rogue Eleven of Rogue Squadron move to Station 3-8. Solo and Chewbacca discovered the blip to be the Imperial Viper probe droid XJ9-CS14, which alerted the Empire to the presence of the rebels before self-destructing. The Alliance then began to evacuate Echo Base, but were soon attacked by the Empire, who claimed victory on Hoth but failed to stop many rebels from escaping.\nWyron Serper had fair skin and brown hair.\nWhile in the Echo Base command center, Serper wore a white bodysuit with a brown, sleeveless, high-collar jacket and made use of a headset.\nWyron Serper first appeared in the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. The character was portrayed by Burnell Tucker in the film and credited only as one of several \"Other Officers.\" Tucker also portrayed Romas Navander in the film, and had previously played the character Del Goren in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Serper's scenes in the Echo Base control room were shot on Stage 1 at Elstree Studios between March 26 and 28, 1979.\nIn the new Star Wars canon, Serper was first identified in a paperback novelization of The Empire Strikes back written by Ryder Windham and released in 2017. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was first used in 1996 on a card in the Hoth Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
