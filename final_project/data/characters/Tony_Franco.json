 "content": "Tony Franco was a youthful Human male Captain of Reginard Base's X-wing squadron during the Galactic Civil War.\nHe was often found in the base's flight hangar checking out spacecraft and supervising operations or chatting with his fellow pilots. When Senior Technician Adonar Dellox's dead body was found, he was on the base's flight deck with Junior Technician Kim Yeasson and arrived on the scene soon after General Halomar Corros. His suite on the base contained the standard furniture, along with several uniforms and a TIE fighter pilot's suit with its helmet and a blaster on its back. This was a trophy from his earlier days. He was also known to possess a datatape on Imperial pilot training.",
