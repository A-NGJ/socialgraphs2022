 "content": "Terisa Kerrill was a human female Imperial officer who served as captain of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Overseer during the Galactic Civil War. A young officer native to Coruscant, Kerrill was mentored by Captain Lindon Javes. She was a lieutenant and member of Helix Squadron at the time of Javes' defection to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\nKerrill continued to serve the Galactic Empire after the death of Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. Admiral Rae Sloane ordered her to investigate the New Republic's Project Starhawk, pitting Kerrill's Star Destroyer against the MC75 Star Cruiser Temperance captained by Javes. Over the course of the mission, Kerrill grew to rely on the pilots of Titan Squadron, including her former squadmate in Helix Squadron.\nTerisa Kerrill grew up as a street orphan on her homeworld of Coruscant. After joining the Galactic Empire in the Imperial Starfighter Corps as a TIE fighter pilot, she was assigned to Helix Squadron, and became a Lieutenant and second-in-command under Captain Lindon Javes. After Javes betrayed his squadron at the Fostar Haven, Kerrill was reassigned in disgrace to the Meram Sector.\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Admiral Rae Sloane assumed command of the remnant Imperial forces, and placed Terisa Kerrill, now a captain in the Imperial Navy, in command of an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, the Overseer. Kerrill was given the task of hunting down and destroying the New Republic's secretive Project Starhawk, and placed Titan Squadron at the forefront of the task force.\nTerisa Kerrill was a natural leader who was extremely loyal. In addition to being a strong commander, she was a skilled pilot. Kerrill had short brown hair and tan skin.\nTerisa Kerrill was created for the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons, portrayed by Peta Sergeant.",
