 "content": "Kaini was an agent of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. She posed as a journalist covering the illegal races that Siro Simito participated in. Kaini and Simito would stage altercations that allowed her to deliver data to him that he would then courier to a destination during a race. On Dahvil prior to the Dahvil-Fodro Hyperspace Promenade, Kaini and Simito staged an incident where he used his vibro-ax to slice off the supertelephoto lens on her droidcam. The information was hidden inside the lens casing, and he pocketed it for later delivery.",
