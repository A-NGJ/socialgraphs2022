 "content": "Portani was a green-skinned, blue-eyed, female Twi'lek who was a lieutenant in the Republic Army during the Cold War, in which the Republic fought the Sith Empire. Portani was stationed on the planet Alderaan in the Apalis Coast region, where the Republic-allied House Organa had an estate. Portani wore armor with green markings on it, and distributed armor and equipment to other Republic forces.\nLieutenant Portani appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Equipment Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Alderaan. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Portani was removed from the game along with the rest of the Equipment Commendations Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
