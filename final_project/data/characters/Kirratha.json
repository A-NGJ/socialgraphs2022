 "content": "Kirratha was one of only a dozen Wookiees alongside Roshyk and Hrrgn who managed to escape from the planet Kessel after their species was enslaved by the Galactic Empire and put to work there. Following their escape the group began working as mercenaries, showing little interest in the politics of the fledgling New Republic followings its creation. When the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca discovered an opportunity to free the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk from Imperial control, Solo requested that Chewbacca contact Kirratha and the other Wookiees, as he considered them some of the meanest, hairiest brutes he had ever met and knew they would want to take part in liberating their home.\nKirratha was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015.",
