 "content": "A Weequay male was a prisoner of the Pyke Syndicate within its fortress on the planet Oba Diah during the Clone Wars, held in a prison cell alongside an Ithorian. When the pilot Trace Martez managed to escape interrogation, she ran past the Weequay's cell, but was caught by a Pyke. The Weequay urged Martez to let him and his fellow prisoner out, which Martez did, activating the door's controls with her foot as the Pyke attempted to hold her down. The two prisoners attacked the Pyke and charged at several reinforcements, which gave Martez a chance to escape. The Weequay and the Ithorian successfully escaped the fortress, and later passed Martez and her fellow fugitives Rafa Martez and Ahsoka Tano in the streets of the nearby city.",
