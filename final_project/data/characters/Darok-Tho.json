 "content": "Darok-Tho was a male Draethos, who was a practitioner of the Keetael Force tradition. Acaadi once traveled to his homeworld, to study traditions. During the Jedi Civil War, he came to the planet Iridonia, because his master's vision led him to believe that he could aid in defeating Acaadi, as it was believed that he was using the knowledge gained from the Keetael tradition to corrupt others. He agreed to help a group of Jedi and spacers in defeating him.",
