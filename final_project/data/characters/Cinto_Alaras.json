 "content": "Cinto Alaras was a male Human medical engineer.\nAlaras, a Human from Rya, studied on Carosi XII Academy of Medicine, and thus in a pro-Rebel Alliance environment; however, he never showed any support to the Rebellion.\nHe obtained a degree around 1 ABY. A lazy and mediocre engineer, he was only offered a job, and he accepted: Designer and medical consultant for Neuro-Saav Corporation labs on Tauber.\nAlaras never designed anything on his own, preferring to provide minimal insight or coordinate other designers. Rebel Alliance Intelligence believed he would attempt to steal another person's design some day.\nThe person in the adjacent design station was Rebel secret agent Sommen. Rebel Alliance Task Force, and particularly Saren Llalik, were afraid of Alaras spying on Sommen's work and discovering his cover.",
