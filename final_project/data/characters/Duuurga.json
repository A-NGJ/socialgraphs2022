 "content": "Duuurga was the second clone of the Hutt crime lord Durga Besadii Tai created by Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn. Cloned from samples of the original Hutt collected by Luuke Skywalker, a clone of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who had died in 9 ABY, Duuurga was created in place of Durga's first clone, Duurga. Thrawn had enjoyed pitting Duurga in arm-wrestles against Chewbaacca, a clone of the Wookiee Chewbacca, which eventually ended in the Hutt having one of his arms pulled out of its socket. After Duuurga was cloned, Thrawn did not let Chewbaaca near him. Like the original Durga, Duuurga was 3.7 meters tall, had no hair and orange eyes.\nDuuurga was mentioned in \"An Apology\", a non-canon short story by Timothy Zahn that was released on April 1, 2012 as an April Fool's Day joke. While the original Durga identified as male, the short story did not specify if Duuurga did the same. In \"An Apology,\" actions taken by characters after they were cloned were performed by clone imposters. Durga was not replaced before his death, and he could not play a role in another Star Wars story afterward; therefore, his clones did not. Duuurga was referred to in the present tense in \"An Apology,\" meaning that Duuurga was still alive when \"An Apology\" was written in 44 ABY.",
