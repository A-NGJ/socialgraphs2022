 "content": "Kayn Somos was a human male Imperial stormtrooper commander active during the height of the Galactic Civil War. He was particularly infamous for being ruthless in his tactics and particularly vicious, even by stormtrooper standards, let alone stormtrooper commander standards. He also headed the Stormtrooper training facility on Morvogodine, which often sent stormtroopers on \"peacekeeping\" missions as final tests, and much like its commander was rather notorious for being very vicious. Owing to his status as a stormtrooper commander, he lives and dies for the Empire, and also held command over both regular stormtroopers and Heavy Stormtroopers. His brutality also showed with his frequent use of firing squads.\nKayn Somos is a character that was introduced in one of the Villain Packs of the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game Star Wars: Imperial Assault.",
