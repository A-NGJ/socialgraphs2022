 "content": "Keelin Zaariq was a female Devaronian Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the decade marked by the Separatist Crisis in the Galactic Senate.\nA Force-sensitive Devaronian, Keelin Zaariq was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at the experimental academy on Almas in the Cularin system. Selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master, Zaariq took assignments which kept her within the Cularin system.\nDuring the time of the Clone Wars, Zaariq and the Human Padawan Jan-Ira Toru were sent by Jedi Master Devan For'deschel to bring the heroes of Cularin to the Almas Academy. They flew a shuttle to Cularin, where they met with the heroes and told them that For'deschel wished to meet with them. They then flew back to Almas, with the heroes.\nIn Twi'light Storm, there are two different ways by which the player characters can be summoned to meet with Master For'deschel, with Zaariq and Toru meeting with them being one of them.",
