 "content": "Rodrigu Battle was an Iridonian Zabrak male pit fighter who fought at the fighting pits of Nar Kanji during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He was friends with fellow fighter Tasu Leech. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Battle fought Leech when the bounty hunter T'onga and her wife Losha Tarkon visited the fighting pit to recruit Leech for her quest to find the young girl Cadeliah. Leech won the fight after he cut off Battle's arm.\nSometime later, Battle was recruited by Grand Leader Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan to serve her as a bodyguard. Battle was present in the Unbroken Clan Territory when T'onga's crew, including Battle's old friend Leech, undertook a mission to kidnap Vukorah as part of their search for Cadeliah. Battle fought Leech and was again defeated, with his leg being cut off, and falling off a building.",
