 "content": "Arum Oru was a male Gotal, who lived during the final years of the Galactic Republic.\nOru was from Antar IV and became a swoop racer. During the Clone Wars, he competed in the Cularin Classic swoop race, on the planet of Cularin.\nOru was competitive, but not aggressively so. He wanted to prove the ability of his swoop team and his swoop, so he tried to perform to a consistent standard on the swoop circuit, rather than aiming for solitary wins.",
