 "content": "Shorran Dak was a Human male gangster who acted as the leader of the Black Talon Gang. During the Clone Wars, Dak was contacted by the rogue scientist Blayne regarding a new type of weaponry that the scientist had developed, and Dak and his gang set a course for Blayne's asteroid base aboard their starship Talon's Wing, hoping to be able to negotiate a deal to procure the weaponry. However, Talon's Wing was boarded en-route by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who captured Dak and his gang and dumped them in an escape pod, which was to be retrieved by Clone Marshal Commander Cody. The Jedi then journeyed to Blayne's facility in Dak's place, with Kenobi posing as Dak and Skywalker as his bodyguard.",
