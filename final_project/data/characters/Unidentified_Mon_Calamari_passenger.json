 "content": "A passenger from the planet Mon Calamari once traveled with the Star Tours agency aboard one of its StarSpeeder 1000s. During the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, that Mon Calamari had boarded the passengers cabin for the spacecraft, next to a Wookiee passenger. However, a Human child sitting in front of them decided to take a picture of them using a camera. As the flash option was activated, both non-Humans ended up stunned by the bright flash, eventually causing the child's mother to scold him. This event was later immortalized by it being included on the safety spiel video for Star Tours.\nThe Mon Calamari passenger appeared in the pre-boarding video, shown when the preparations for the ride have been completed.\nThe passenger wore a similar outfit to Mon Calamari senator Meena Tills, although it is not known whether they were intended to be the same entity.",
