 "content": "Shinnan was a Human female from Another Hopetown on Ennth, who was married to Rastur. She had sepia eyes and dark brown hair. She was a friend of Zekk and died during the evacuation process when a groundquake struck. At the time of her death, she was trying to locate the plans for the new house she and her husband were going to build after the quakes had stopped. The groundquake was part of a series of groundquakes that take place every eight years on the planet Ennth.",
