 "content": "Komi was a female Human who served as an assistant to Commander S. Geland during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nAround 3641 BBY, Komi was present on the prison world of Belsavis. During a major breakout and rioting that the Empire caused, Komi contacted the Barsen'thor for assistance. Later, she called Commander Geland on the holo to let him know that the Barsen'thor was arriving. Geland thanked her and began to kill everyone, forcing Komi to watch in horror. It turns out that Geland was a child of the Emperor. As the Barsen'thor arrived, Komi raised her weapon and shot the communication to prevent Geland from seeing. She revealed everything to the Jedi, but since Geland left his ID card, there was no way to track him. She went on to destroy the IDs of the dead victims.",
