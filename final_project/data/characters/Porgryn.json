 "content": "Porgryn was a female Zabrak. When she was young, she longed to become a warrior, but her dreams were shattered when she accidentally inhaled a caustic gas. The gas crippled her permanently, making even the simple act of breathing difficult for her, even though she was fitted with the latest medical implants. In the years after her accident, she survived her depression by losing herself amongst the travelers and indigents of Tatooine.\nHowever, her life changed when she was discovered by the mercenary Loruna Scathe, who befriended Porgryn. The Zabrak became a trusted member of the inner-circle of the Azure Cabal and was their best covert operative.\nPorgryn appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
