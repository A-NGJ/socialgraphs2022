 "content": "A clone stormtrooper served the Galactic Empire early in its reign under Commander \"Keller\" and his unit. The trooper was present on Toola following the execution of Order 66, and was part of a group stationed at the Toola Spaceport. Two Jedi survivors, Jedi Master Kai Hudorra and Padawan Noirah Na were able to trick the trooper into letting them board a transport.\nGrown on the planet Kamino from the DNA of the prime clone Jango Fett, the basis of the clone trooper army, the trooper served in the Galactic Empire on Toola soon after the implementation of Order 66, a directive by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious– publicly the Republic Supreme Chancellor– in the final year of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY. Clone forces had previously participated in the Battle of Toola, an engagement between Republic forces led by Jedi Generals Kai Hudorra and Simms, alongside Jedi Commander Noirah Na and Clone Commander \"Keller.\"\nWith Order 66 declared shortly after the Republic victory, Hudorra and Na were able to survive the assault and escape to the city of Ithaqua Station. Commander Keller led his clone unit in hunting down the surviving Jedi. Jedi Master Hudorra and Padawan Na then travelled to the Toola Spaceport in the city to escape to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. There they encountered a clone contingent, including the clone stormtrooper, who had a responsibility to check the boarding cards of civilians.\nThe trooper ordered the pair to present boarding passes, during which Hudorra displayed his card and used a mind trick to convince the trooper that everything was in order. The trooper confirmed as such, and the two Jedi were allowed to board a transport.\nAs a clone of Jango Fett, the trooper was a Human male who stood at 1.83 meters tall. The trooper succumbed to a Jedi mind trick, which was usually effective against the weak-minded.\nThe trooper was outfitted with white phase II clone trooper armor, a white pauldon, and a white kama. While at the Toola Spaceport, the trooper utilized a DC-15S blaster.\nThe trooper debuted in Republic 80, the second of a two-part story arc within Star Wars: Republic by Dark Horse Comics. The comic was released on December 21, 2005, and was authored by Randy Stradley and pencilled by Douglas Wheatley.",
