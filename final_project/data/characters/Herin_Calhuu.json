 "content": "Herin Calhuu was a human male active during the Galactic Civil War, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. At some point in his life, Calhuu joined the Imperial Military, where he served as a member of the elite Stormtrooper Corps in the Anoat sector. Skilled in offensive combat, Calhuu's military career set him on the path to becoming a stormtrooper commander, but before he could be promoted, Calhuu bore witness to Imperial atrocities that deeply shook his devotion to the Empire.\nBy the time of the Iron Blockade, enacted by Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard in an attempt to lock down the Anoat sector following the destruction of the second Death Star, Calhuu had deserted. During a period of rebellious unrest in the sector, Herin Calhuu came into contact with an up-and-coming young smuggler from Burnin Konn. Calhuu joined the smuggler's crew, and carried out various missions throughout the Anoat sector on their behalf.\nHerin Calhuu first appeared in Star Wars canon in the multiplayer mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, created by the Kabam company and released on September 10, 2015 for iOS and Android platforms. Within the scope of the game, Calhuu acts as a potential crewmate for the player character, able to be tasked with carrying out timed quests to recover valuable experience points and loot.",
