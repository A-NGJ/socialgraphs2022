 "content": "Ror Ithh was a brown-skinned Ithorian who lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. In 22 BBY, Ithh was on the planet Coruscant, where the Ithorian visited the Outlander Club. Ithh stood near the Gran Nic Whoma in the club, and while they were there the bounty hunter Zam Wesell entered the club, pursued by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Wesell attempted to attack Kenobi, but was caught by Skywalker, who then assured the club's patrons, including Ithh, that they were on Jedi business. While at the club Ithh wore a red and brown robe.\nRor Ithh first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, in which the character was played by an uncredited extra. Ithh was not named until 2003 as part of the Image Attack feature on StarWars.com in an image titled \"Jedi Business\". The Ithorian was also mentioned in \"Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night\", an article written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2004 in the 75th issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine, which also revealed that the patron's name was based on the word Ithorian. None of these sources revealed Ithh's gender.",
