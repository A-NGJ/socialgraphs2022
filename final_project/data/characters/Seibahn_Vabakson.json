 "content": "Seibahn Vabakson was a male Chiss intelligence operative who was active during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Vabakson offered his services to the Empire, serving as part of the Dread Executioners on the moon Oricon during the phase of the conflict known as the Dread War.\nSeibahn Vabakson was first added to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of Game Update 2.4: The Dread War. He appeared on Oricon, where he was the Basic Gear vendor for the Imperial Agent class. Vabakson and the rest of the class gear vendors at Oricon, along with all other Daily Areas and high-level planets, were replaced by standardized vendors in Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015; he was replaced by Agent Tomms.",
