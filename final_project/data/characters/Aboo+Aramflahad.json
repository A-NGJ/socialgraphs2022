 "content": "Aboo Aramflahad was a male Ithorian cybernetic specialist who operated out of the Coronet City medical center during the Galactic Civil War.\nAboo Aramflahad was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. In the game, all three cybernetic specialists were erroneously identified as Aboo Aramflahad. However, the Friday Feature titled Review of Cybernetics identified the true Aboo Aramflahad as the Ithorian working in Coronet, and the other two as Nssktkslis and Mindt F'abul.",
