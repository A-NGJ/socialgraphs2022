 "content": "Frizz was a male Defel.\nFrizz was born on the planet Af'El and after leaving his homeworld, he was befriended by the Corellian criminal Kal Jorek. Jorek could not pronounce Frizz's Defel name correctly, so gave him the new name \"Frizz,\" which the Defel eventually became accustomed to. Frizz became Jorek's right-hand man and once, while working for the Hutt Cartel, they traveled to the planet Naboo, where they sold illegal weaponry from a warehouse on the edge of the capital city Theed. While they were there, the Naboo Security officer Lieutenant Trayl Caltos hired some mercenaries to stake out the warehouse and capture Jorek and Frizz.",
