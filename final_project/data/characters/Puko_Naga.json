 "content": "Puko Naga was a male Nikto who worked for Jabba the Hutt during the Clone Wars. In 22 BBY, Puko Naga along with another guard greeted and accompanied Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi into Jabba's Palace so he could negotiate with Jabba an agreement between the Hutts and the Republic.\nPuko Naga was first identified in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars card game from Mexican chips producer Sabritas. His game statistics are roughly average in both attack and defense. The Puko Naga's action figure from Hasbro comes with a game card to allow players to pit him against other figures in the line. Naga's game statistics make him poor in use of the Force and in leadership, but fair in battle skills, intelligence, mechanical skills, and luck.\nA male Kajain'sa'Nikto guard of Jabba's, similar in appearance with Puko Naga, was located at the Hutt's palace during the Clone Wars. The guard informed Jabba's protocol droid, TC-70, that the four bounty hunters sent out by Jabba to find his abducted son, Rotta, had returned, albeit decapitated.",
