 "content": "Jebbiz'Foreanda was a male Twi'lek, who lived in The Enclave on Ryloth during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nForeanda was once a member of the ruling council of the settlement of Bashka, on the planet Ryloth. However, when one of the council members died, per Twi'lek custom, Foreanda was forced to walk into the Ryloth Badlands, where he couldn't survive long. However, he was found by Jedi Master Vhiin Thorla, who took Foreanda to The Enclave, a community of outcasts that Thorla had established.\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, Foreanda was an elderly man. He was very charismatic and liked to talk. He also liked to listen to stories about what was going on outside of the Enclave and Ryloth.",
