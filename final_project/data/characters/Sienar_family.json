 "content": "The Sienar family were a noble family who dedicated themselves to the war effort of the Galactic Empire by being a major producer of TIE fighters; one member was Raith Sienar, the head of Sienar Fleet Systems. They were rewarded accordingly, and the members of the family serving in the Imperial Starfighter Corps had the right to wear a special flight helmet with a bronze finish. Unfortunately for the Sienars, a member of their family, Gracalia Vatara Sienar, decided to join the New Republic, where she flew under Vanguard Squadron.",
