 "content": "A male human was born on the planet Alderaan but moved to the planet Coruscant, where he had two children with a another human Alderaanian. The family lived in an apartment on Level 3204 of Coruscant, a level inhabited by many other Alderaanian immigrants, in the year 0 BBY. The man was away from Coruscant on a trade mission when his homeworld was destroyed by the Galactic Empire. During the riots on Level 3204 following the destruction of Alderaan, the man's partner assured their children that their father was safe and would be home soon, but neither child believed her. His eldest child, Anandra Milon, was reminded of her father when her younger brother Santigo Milon showed bitter determination while fleeing Imperial persecution.\nAnandra Milon's father was first mentioned, but not named, in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151.",
