 "content": "The father of Kylia Stryder, who was a Rebel Alliance operative, was a human commander of the Galactic Empire in the Anoat sector. Unbeknownst to him, his daughter—his pride and joy—had been recruited by the rebels while she was still a teenager. She later joined the Uprising insurgent group, led by their leader, a human male known as the Smuggler, to aid in liberating the sector from Governor Ubrik Adelhard and his Imperial remnant. The young Stryder thus went on various missions as directed by the Smuggler.\nKylia Stryder's father was mentioned in the description for Kylia Stryder, an obtainable crew member in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, prior to the game's shutdown in 2016.",
