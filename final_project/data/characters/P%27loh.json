 "content": "P'loh was a female Yuuzhan Vong and one of future shaper Nen Yim's crèche-mates. At one point P'loh, Yim and another of her crèche-mates, Zhul, stole a korsk. This creature, used by the Yuuzhan Vong for cleaning, was released by P'loh and Zhul into a communal food area whereupon it consumed all of the i'fii there. Later, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, P'loh was assigned to the Outer Rim world of Belkadan, where she died.\nYim's memories of P'loh were transferred to captured Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila when she was experimented upon by the renegade shaper Mezhan Kwaad and implanted with a Yuuzhan Vong persona known as Riina. Veila discussed her implanted memories with Yim, who divulged that the memories of P'loh were her own.\nP'loh was first mentioned in Greg Keyes' 2003 novel The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy.",
