He took Kaeden and Miara Larte into his crew after they were orphaned. Vartan worked with Ahsoka Tano to organize a resistance against the Imperial occupation of Raada. He took over the Raada cell after Ahsoka left. During the evacuation of Raada, he was severely injured by a blast from an Imperial tank, losing two of his limbs.",
