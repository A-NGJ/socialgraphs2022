In 3 ABY, Falltower was posted to Haven Base on Arbra when the Alliance ran a novel experiment of concealing its fleet within the chromosphere of the star, Arbran, by way of five Kerts-Bhrg generators. Falltower was present with the fleet when the protective field was activated, and afterward he was among the retinue that accompanied Princess Leia Organa through the star and back to the base.\nFalltower appeared in Star Wars 58, written by David Michelinie, illustrated by Walter Simonson and released in 1982.",
