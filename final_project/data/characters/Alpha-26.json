 "content": "Alpha-26, also known by A-26 or the name Maze, was an Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando captain in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nMaze helped Jedi General Arligan Zey oversee the extraction of Omega Squad from Qiilura following the success of their mission.\nMaze was stationed on Coruscant for most of the war, assisting Zey. Maze developed a grudge against Null-class Advanced Recon Commando Null-11, nicknamed Ordo, when the latter beat Maze up when the captain attempted to lecture Ordo to obey Jedi Generals.\nMaze managed to get his vengeance, however. After Ordo and the clone commandos of Omega Squad neutralized a terrorist cell on Coruscant, Maze attended a victory celebration held by Kal Skirata. When the men performed the Mandalorian war chant, Dha Werda Verda, Ordo got his just desserts, with Maze \"accidentally\" punching him in the mouth several times. Maze and Ordo then walked off together. He would later be offered by Zey a chance to leave the Grand Army if he ever wanted out. From this point on, Ordo feels he and Maze have a tacit understanding.\nAs the war progressed, Maze used his downtime to read, and developed strong opinions about the state of the Republic. While no fan of the political leadership under Palpatine, he thought the Jedi should not interfere as they were not elected.\nDuring the Great Jedi Purge, Maze returned to Special Operations Brigade headquarters to find Ordo and General Zey talking about the events leading to the purge. Ordo demanded to know from a wounded Zey if the Jedi did indeed try to overthrow Palpatine. Zey admitted to as much, stating that it was his duty as Palpatine had revealed himself to be a Sith Lord, known as Darth Sidious. Most tellingly, Maze wondered what the Sith were and Ordo explained that they were the exact opposite of the Jedi. Ordo left the two, Zey wounded slouching in a chair, and Maze with his blaster drawn, begging Zey to come quietly and as if he was just arresting him. Zey issued his last order, and asked Maze to execute him, as he knew what would happen if he was captured alive. Maze did not comply and missed Zey on purpose, giving Ordo the idea that he executed Zey. Later Maze contacted the Skirata Clan and asked for refuge on Kyrimorut on Mandalore. Bardan Jusik was sent to retrieve Maze and unexpectedly met with Zey who was with Maze. After arriving on Mandalore, the two greeted a stunned and surprised Ordo.",
