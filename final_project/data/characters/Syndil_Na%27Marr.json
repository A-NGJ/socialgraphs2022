 "content": "Syndil Na'Marr was a woman who resided on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, Syndil Na'Marr bought the legs from a R2 unit to the junk dealer Watto. However, the droid was wanted by both Imperial Commander Barrezz and Rebel Captain Bastra and an Imperial Captain soon confiscated the legs. One of Syndil's friend, a Bothan pilot, later went after the Imperial Captain and managed to ambush and destroy the Captain's AT-ST in the Mospic High Range. However, the pilot was downed and unable to contact Syndil Na'Marr. When a spacer looking for the droid legs approached Syndil, she agreed to give them if the spacer was able to rescue her missing pilot friend. The spacer thus went to the mountains, found the downed pilot and finally recovered the droid legs from hostile Tusken Raiders in the area.\nSyndil Na'Marr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Syndil Na'Marr was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
