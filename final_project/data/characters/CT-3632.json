 "content": "CT-3632 was a Human male clone trooper who served in the 501st Legion of the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, in the year 19 BBY, he was stationed on the planet Vaklin after an Insurgency rose up against the Empire there due to three members of the Jedi Order. Twelve days after the second of the Jedi who had helped start the insurgence was defeated, CT-3632 was part of a patrol lead by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, which included two enforcer squads of stormtroopers, a TX-130 Fighter Tank, at least one 74-Z speeder bike and a clone trooper commander. The squad set out at 0700 hours local time, with the intention of capturing or killing Cho'na Bene, another Jedi who helped start the insurgency. CT-3632 was given the task of perimeter patrol ahead of the main group during the patrol, and as the patrol entered the area known as the Howling Ruins, he reported that he had found no activity to CT-3636, another member clone trooper in the group. 3636 told 3632 to change the perimeter sweep to seventy meters and stay cautious, after which the patrol was ambushed by Bene and the insurgents. Twelve of the troopers in the patrol, including 3636 were killed in the following battle, with the rest falling back to the command center afterwards.",
