 "content": "Darth Krovos was a female Pureblood Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire living during the Galactic War.\nAs a young Sith Acolyte, Krovos survived her training on Korriban by convincing her fellow students to work together to complete their final trials to the planet's tombs. By doing so, all the acolytes emerged victorious from the trial. Though this angered her Overseer, the other students threatened to kill the overseer if any harm was done to Krovos. This unique approach to her trials caught the eye of Darth Decimus, who took her as an apprentice.\nAs an apprentice, her victories following Korriban gained her recognition and she fought alongside the Empire's most notorious Sith such as Darth Marr and Darth Malgus. Krovos went on to climb the ranks of the Empire as her career advanced. In 3637 BBY she was working alongside Admiral Zasha Ranken, whom she developed a deep respect for. At the time of the Battle of Kuat she served as Ranken's right hand, overseeing the course of the battle and directing an Imperial strike team to their objectives on the Kuati space station.\nShe would later rise to the position of Darth during the intervening years, and would sit on the Dark Council by 3627 BBY, as Head of Military Command - a newly created seat that oversaw the former Spheres of Defense of the Empire, Military Offense \u0026 Military Strategy. In this position, she commanded Imperial forces at the Meridian Complex assault.\nKrovos was a reformist who supported the inclusion of non-Humans and non-Sith in the ranks of the Empire and believed that the wisdom of those without the Force should be acknowledged. Krovos believed that cooperation and unity could achieve the Empire's goals more easily compared to needless infighting. Though Krovos amassed great power in the Empire, she still recognized the talent of others, including those who were not Sith.\nKrovos first appeared in the Galactic Starfighter expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. In the Imperial storyline of the Onslaught expansion, Krovos traveled to the Dantooine Jedi Enclave to investigate the whereabouts of Darth Malgus along with the Commander and Darth Rivix. Darth Krovos expressed disbelief in the possibility that Malgus could have chosen to betray the Empire and go rogue.",
