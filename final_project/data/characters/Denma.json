 "content": "Denma was a male Rodian who was a member of the Red Fury Brotherhood, a pirate organization that operated during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. In about 21 BBY, Denma and a number of other Brotherhood members joined a Separatist-aligned cell on the planet Druckenwell, and they plotted to destroy a Republic Acclamator-class assault ship that was docked with the space station New Dawn in orbit of Druckenwell. Denma and fellow Rodian Tazzik acted as the functional leaders of the crew of pirates that were to carry out the attack, and they planned to fly to the space station aboard the stolen freighter First Light, then take control of the assault ship and record a holovid of the vessel's destruction, to broadcast to the rest of the galaxy. However, when Denma and the rest of the pirates took off from Druckenwell in the First Light to initiate their raid, a group of freelance agents stowed away aboard the ship. The agents then attacked Denma and the rest of the crew, preventing them from destroying the Acclamator assault ship.",
