 "content": "Evlyn Tabory was the daughter of Rosemari Pressor Tabory, the niece of Jorad Pressor, and the granddaughter of Dillian Pressor.\nEvlyn was born on the Outbound Flight Colony around 12 ABY and helped her uncle in his duties as Guardian of the People, using her Force powers to manipulate intruders into falling into traps set around the Dreadnaughts. Evlyn was Force-sensitive, a fact that Rosemary and Jorad covered up to prevent her from being exiled to D-Three. Luke Skywalker invited her to train at the Jedi Praxeum, but though she wanted to, she instead went with her mother and Dean Jinzler to live in the Empire of the Hand after the Survivors were rescued from The Redoubt.",
