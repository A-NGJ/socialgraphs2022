 "content": "Aragon was a male Elder of the Melodie species who lived on the moon of Yavin 8 around 22 ABY.\nAragon was the oldest Melodie in Sistra Mountain and the community's \"keeper of legends\", which he inherited from his mother Elsa. Due to his age, Aragon was not able to surface at all and lived in underwater caverns deep in Sistra. He had long white hair and yellow eyes.\nHe assisted the Jedi trainees Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila during their journey in the underwater caverns of Sistra by providing them with information about the Golden Globe's origins. Aragon told them that the Massassi came to the moon in 3997 BBY to ask for help in freeing their trapped children from the Golden Globe, which had been constructed by the Sith Lord Exar Kun during his tyrannical reign over the Massassi species for the sole purpose of draining the life energies of its captives. Since the Melodies were unable to help, they left messages engraved on the rocks and tunnels of the moon so that someone might be able to read them and break the curse.",
