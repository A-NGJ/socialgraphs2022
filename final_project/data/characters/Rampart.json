 "content": "Rampart was a human male who held the rank of Vice Admiral in the Galactic Empire shortly after its formation from the Galactic Republic. Eagerly taking on his role in the new Empire, Rampart oversaw the implementation of chain codes as well as the enlistment of soldiers for the Imperial Army as part of Project War-Mantle. Believing that the loyalty of recruits was more valuable to the Empire than the clone troopers formerly used by the Republic, Rampart had confidence in the success of his initiative.\nAt Tipoca City on Kamino, Rampart presented to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin the first Elite Squad, a squad of top soldiers. Following a mission of the squad under their new commander, the clone trooper CT-9904 \"Crosshair\", Tarkin placed the project in Rampart's hands. On Tarkin's orders, Rampart later oversaw the destruction of Tipoca City and seizure of Kamino's cloning technology into Imperial control.\nFollowing the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of the Galactic Empire from the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY, Rampart served as an officer in the new Empire, holding the rank of Vice Admiral. He assisted in the transition from Republic to Empire, wishing to strengthen the foundations of the newly-formed regime. Rampart was responsible for the implementation of chain codes, a form of identification for citizens of the Empire. He issued a holographic message regarding chain codes that was displayed at Imperial chain code posts; the message informed citizens that chain codes allowed for the exchange of now-invalid currency for Imperial credits.\nRampart also oversaw Project War-Mantle, an initiative to recruit conscripted and volunteer soldiers into the Imperial Army to replace the clone troopers formerly used by the Republic. As part of the project, he assembled the first Elite Squad, consisting of four recruited Elite Squad Troopers. Rampart traveled to Tipoca City on the planet Kamino to showcase the squad to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin. Upon meeting with Tarkin, who was watching the enhanced Clone Commander CT-9904 \"Crosshair\" alongside the Kaminoan Nala Se, Rampart's superior complimented the success of his chain code implementation before asking of Project War-Mantle's status. Rampart proceeded to inform Tarkin about how laying the Empire's foundation was very important and of the recruits' presence, and that the Elite Squad was to train under the command of Crosshair.\nOn their way to the hangar to meet the squad, Rampart asserted the need for more soldiers. Nala Se insisted that the Kaminoan cloning facilities were capable of producing effective clones, but Rampart believed that enlistment though choice would yield troopers with more loyalty to the Empire. When they arrived in the hangar, Rampart presented the Elite Squad, which he suggested could be trained by skilled clones. Shortly afterward, as Rampart and Tarkin watched the squad undergo a medical examination, Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su expressed doubt over recruits being able to match clone troopers in military proficiency. Rampart protested, asserting the value that he saw in the loyalty of willing recruits. To settle the debate, Tarkin proposed a test for the squad as he felt the two Imperials needed to see what they can do in battle and Rampart was more than happy to let his recruits go out onto the field so the Governor had Rampart send them and their Clone Commander to Onderon to eliminate a camp of insurgents led by Saw Gerrera.\nWhen the squad's Nu-class attack/transport shuttle returned to Kamino in triumph, Vice Admiral Rampart and Governor Tarkin awaited them in the hangar. Tarkin noted that the squad had lost a trooper—ES-01 had been executed by Crosshair for refusing to kill citizens under Gerrera's protection on Onderon—but Crosshair reported that the camp had been dealt with, though Gerrera had left before they arrived. Rampart then reminded his superior that the loss was unfortunate but soldiers know the risks of battle. Tarkin was impressed as they succeeded while Crosshair's brothers had failed, while Rampart saw the success as proof of the potential of his initiative. As a result, Tarkin left Rampart in charge of the project and departed from Kamino.\nSome time after his arrival in Tipoca City, Rampart met with Prime Minister Lama Su, insisting that he be informed of all matters on Kamino from then on. The meeting was interrupted by Crosshair, who reported that the Scrapper Guild on the junk planet Bracca had detected a power surge on a wrecked Jedi cruiser. Rampart ordered Crosshair to send a scout team, but the clone requested more forces, revealing that the source of the surge was Clone Force 99, a rogue unit of clone commandos who had previously escaped Kamino. Though Lama Su insisted that the clones of the unit were highly skilled assets and as such should be returned alive if possible, Rampart, disinterested in rogue clone deserters, dismissed Lama Su and ordered Crosshair to terminate them if they were found.\nRampart, Crosshair and the Elite Squad went to the Outer Rim planet Ryloth, where the native Twi'lek population was uneasy with the Empire's military presence, which the preceding Republic had promised to remove after the Clone Wars. In Ryloth's capital city of Lessu, Rampart held a mass gathering at the Capitol building, alongside Senator Orn Free Taa, the Twi'lek Resistance General Cham Syndulla, Cham's wife Eleni and the clone Captain Howzer of Ryloth's local clone battalion. Rampart received a report from Crosshair that one of the Empire's skeptics, Cham's Lieutenant Gobi Glie, and several fellow insurgents are within the crowd, and Rampart explained his displeasure to Taa at the senator's people's apparent lack of support towards the Empire. Taa reassured the Vice Admiral that he spoke for the people that the partnership was most welcome. Rampart inquired whether Cham agreed, to which the Twi'lek general supported peace for Ryloth.\nRampart watched on as Senator Taa failed to galvanize the support of the people of Ryloth, having delivered a speech about how the Empire would bring peace and prosperity to the planet and that the Twi'leks should step down from their military posts. Cham stepped in, reassuring the crowd by reminding them about how the clones helped liberate their world from the Separatist Alliance and had earned the Twi'leks' respect. After the speech, Rampart remarked to Eleni that it was a shame that her and Cham's daughter, Hera, could not be a part of the occasion but she said their little girl had other interests.\nIn a meeting with Taa and Crosshair, Rampart exclaimed that Cham was being more cooperative than he had been led to believe he would be, to which Taa responded that he was worried about the general's influence over the citizens. Crosshair believed Glie was more of a threat than Cham, but the senator believed they all need to be dealt with, to which Rampart stated that everyone had their part to play. Later on, the Admiral showed Cham and Eleni around the doonium refinery, claiming that it would help rebuild areas affected by the Clone Wars across the galaxy. Eleni was concerned at the militaristic aspects of the facility, but Rampart responded that the Republic had left Ryloth in a vulnerable position, something which the Empire was rectifying in order to protect the planet's interest, before excusing himself after receiving a message from one of Crosshair's squad members.\nRampart received intelligence from Crosshair that Glie, Hera, and the Twi'lek resistance fighter Serin were on a supply run to smuggle weapons, having attached a homing beacon to their ship. Upon their return, the ship was shot down by Crosshair. The trio were quickly apprehended, and Rampart arrived with Taa and numerous clone troopers, expressing how distressing it was to see Hera's involvement in this operation. Taa angrily claimed that Hera's involvement was clear proof that Cham was plotting an uprising against the Empire. However, Rampart disagreed, saying that the public would not see it that way, and that Cham had not technically committed a crime yet. Hera, Gobi and Serin were taken away in a HCVw A9 turbo tank, while Crosshair informed Rampart he had spotted three more of Gobi's insurgents on the mountain ridge. Rampart told Crosshair to hold off and let the resistance fighters report back, having the commander to get into position regardless.\nRampart's convoy, comprising of the juggernaut and escorting BARC speeders, was intercepted by Cham and Eleni and the remaining insurgents, and he expressed concern at the whereabouts of the reinforcements, with Howzer stating the comms had been cut. Taa ordered the remaining troopers to defend them, but Rampart had Howzer and his men stand down and surrender. This horrified Taa, but Rampart reassured the senator that his decision would keep them all alive. With Hera reunited with her parents, the insurgents pondered on what to do with Taa, Rampart and the other prisoners. Cham and Taa become locked in a bitter exchange in which they both accused the other of being a traitor, leading to Cham pointing a gun at the senator. Taa pleaded with Rampart and Howzer to do something, but Rampart was unmoved, stating that Cham was the one holding the blaster.\nWith some encouragement from Howzer and Eleni, Cham lowered his weapon, and Rampart thanked Taa for playing his part, signaling Crosshair to shoot one of Taa's lekku from a vantage point. At this exact moment, Imperial reinforcements arrived to aid Rampart and Howzer, leading to the capture of the Twi'lek fighters present, except for Hera and her droid C1-10P \"Chopper,\" who escaped on a landspeeder. Rampart then formally arrested Cham and the insurgents for the attempted assassination of Senator Taa. As Cham, Eleni, Gobi, Serin and fellow fighter Lenk were all led away, Rampart ordered Howzer to assemble his forces to locate Hera, before departing in one of the Low Altitude Assault Transports with the prisoners.\nSoon after Vice Admiral Rampart and Captain Howzer walked through the detention block of the Capitol building in Ryloth's capital of Lessu. When they reached the cell holding Cham and Eleni, Rampart mocked Cham, saying he was once considered the liberator of Ryloth, but is now a traitor to Ryloth after attempting to assassinate Senator Taa. Cham retorts that the people wouldn't believe the Empire's lies, but Rampart believed that they would turn against him easily. However knowing that their daughter was out there and since she was the reasonable one, Rampart asked Eleni about where Hera was and promised to return her to the hands of her parents safe and sound but knowing about how his allies are treated, Eleni claimed she would rather be his enemy like her husband is now than a friend. Rampart then ordered Howzer to scour the planet and arrest all of General Syndulla's supporters. When Howzer swore to find Hera as well, Rampart told him that Crosshair's squad was already taking care of that. Rampart then addressed the citizens of Ryloth, telling them those responsible for the shocking attack on their senator have been detained, and that Orn Free Taa would make a full recovery. In the city, Rampart told Howzer that arresting some of Cham's supporters wasnt good enough, he wanted them all. Howzer was concerned that arresting innocent citizens would provoke an uprising, but Rampart said that they should be arrested too and peace has a cost. Captain Howzer later informed Vice Admiral Rampart that the refinery wa under attack. He offered to deal with it but Rampart insisted on handling the attack and ordered Howzer to guard the Capital. Then after seeing what Crosshair's old team was capable of, Rampart gave him permission to hunt down his brothers.\nAt Tipoca City on Kamino, Crosshair told Vice Admiral Rampart that the operation was ahead of schedule. A pleased Rampart asked that every available clone be mobilized. As Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunships took off, a Kaminoan watched. When Crosshair asked about the Kaminoans, Rampart said that they have their orders and to keep their eye on them until the time is right.\nAt Tipoca City, Vice-Admiral Rampart confronted Prime Minister Lama Su, telling him that he is disappointed at the Kaminoans' lack of cooperation. He informed the Prime Minister that a disturbing matter had been brought to his attention. As Elite Squad Troopers entered the room with Nala Se, Rampart said that Su's Chief Scientist was gathering medical personnel to flee Kamino. Lama Su feigned surprise and said he will decide on a suitable punishment.\nRampart said that while he found the clone troopers overrated, he told Nala Se that he hopes to utilize her services as a scientist for the Empire. However, he had little need for Lama Su's services as a politician. Two Elite Squad Troopers arrested the Kaminoan Prime Minister for treason.\nUpon landing at Tipoca City, Hunter was marched out of the ship by Crosshair and his Elite Squad Troopers. Vice Admiral Rampart greeted them accompanied by several Clone troopers. Crosshair told Rampart that he planed to the intercept the rest of the Bad Batch on arrival. Rampart spoke to Hunter, telling him that the destruction his squad caused on Ryloth got his attention. Rampart left Hunter to Commander Crosshair, telling him to stay on schedule. ES-02 questioned Crosshair's motives with his old squad, adding that she doesn't trust any of them. Rampart replied to her that if Crosshair's plan fails, none of them would be a problem anymore. He ordered her to keep an close eye on things.\nLater when Crosshair´s plan failed ES-02 informed Rampart that Crosshair had lost control of the situation. Rampart ordered that all remaining forces be pulled out and told her to let the clones die together. Rampart then informed Admiral and Governor Tarkin that all essential personnel had been evacuated from Kamino. Tarkin asked him about the chief scientist. Rampart reported that the chief scientist was secured and the cloning technology was now under Imperial control. Tarkin allowed him to fire when ready. Rampart ordered the crew of the Star Destroyer to move the ship into position. An Imperial officer confirmed that they were in position and Rampart ordered the gunners to bombard Tipoca City. After receiving confirmation that the city was destroyed, Rampart ordered the Star Destroyers to leave Kamino and make their way to a rendezvous point with the Imperial Fleet.\nA human male, Rampart had brown hair, brown eyes, and light skin. Vice Admiral Rampart eagerly took on his role in the newly-formed Galactic Empire, which aimed to instill order in the galaxy. Rampart perceived the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of the Empire as a chance for peace, claiming it would bring with it opportunity and prosperity. He saw importance in laying a strong foundation for the new Empire and believed that an increase in soldiers was necessary to maintain order and permit a strong ruling government. As such, Rampart's efforts in Project War Mantle sought to produce loyal soldiers without the need for clones, and he was confident that his proposal would strengthen the future of the Empire. Rampart felt that the loyalty of those who willingly enlisted was more valuable than the training underwent by clone troopers, believing that with training, his forces would be unlike anything the galaxy had seen.\nIn the effort to expand Imperial presence and power across the galaxy, Rampart was particularly patient, cunning and opportunistic in his approach. On Ryloth, he opted to momentarily surrender against Cham Syndulla's forces in order to preserve himself until reinforcements arrived - and in doing so, allowed imperial forces to regroup and eventually capture Syndulla and frame him for the attempted assassination of Orn Free Taa in the process. Rampart was also very pragmatic. When his Elite Squad returned from its mission having lost one trooper, Rampart saw the loss as unfortunate, but was not concerned, claiming that soldiers knew the risks associated with battle. In his message regarding chain codes, Rampart asserted the generosity of the Empire in allowing citizens to exchange for Imperial credits.\nRampart wore the uniform of an Imperial officer, including a rank insignia plaque and four code cylinders. Rampart's position in the Imperial Navy gave him command over at least three Venator-class Star Destroyers that belonged to a larger fleet. Rampart once fired a RK-3 blaster.\nVice Admiral Rampart was first unveiled for the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch on May 4, 2021, in a figure for Hasbro's Star Wars: The Black Series. He subsequently appeared via hologram in \"Cut and Run,\" the second episode of the series, released on Disney+ on May 7, 2021, in which he was voiced by Noshir Dalal and identified in the credits.",
