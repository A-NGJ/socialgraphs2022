 "content": "Meymik was a male Chadra-Fan who had a criminal career in the Anoat sector of the galaxy. He claimed to have once been a personal enforcer of Jabba the Hutt, but these claims were fabricated. Despite his lies, people avoided arguing with Meymik, as the criminal was known to carry a large amount of grenades. Meymik could also wield a blaster pistol, and he had skills as a jeweler.\nDuring the Galactic Empire's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, Meymik joined the crew of a young smuggler, assisting them on various missions.",
