 "content": "Jos Mayda was a Human male from Garos IV, who was the son of Desto Mayda and a childhood friend of Dair Haslip.\nIn 6 BBY, the Galactic Empire established an official presence on Garos IV and ended the Garosian Civil War. Very enthusiastic, Jos Mayda decided to join the Imperial Army but all his hopes were halted when his father was revealed as a rebel and wanted by the Empire.\nSome days before his friend Dair entered at the academy, they were walking around Garos IV when they were attacked by two Imperial scout troopers looking for a deserter. Jos was shot down for no reason and Dair killed them. This convinced Dair to join the resistance and enter at the academy as a spy.",
