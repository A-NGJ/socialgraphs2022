 "content": "Chase DeVitt was a Corellian gambler who frequented Tiranga's Loft. Arriving on Corellia after a misadventure with Drake Paulsen, DeVitt decided to stay since he had a price on his head. An exceptional gambler, DeVitt found employment with Tiranga who used his skills to counter players who were either too lucky or had a suspicious winning streak. DeVitt's reputation brought some of the best gamblers in the galaxy to Tiranga's Loft to challenge him.",
