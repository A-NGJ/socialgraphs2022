 "content": "A deck gunner worked onboard Jabba the Hutt's sail barge during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon on Tatooine. He was a Human male with light skin and black hair.\nAfter the initial attempt by Luke Skywalker and his friends to free Han Solo from Jabba's Palace, the gunner was present when Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca's intended execution turned into an all-out battle. He saw Skywalker kill Vizam after the Nikto had fired a laser cannon on the skiff carrying Solo, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian. He rushed to take control of the cannon while Skywalker fought several guards.\nThe deck gunner found the Rebels' skiff too tempting a target to pass up, but failed to notice the arrival of Princess Leia Organa, who knocked him out with a vibro-lance. Leia then used a larger cannon to blast the deck of the barge, moments before the Rebels' escaped and the sail barge exploded.\nThis gunner can briefly be seen in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, but Leia's attack on him was cut from the film. A fraction of that footage can be seen in the final film where Leia moves towards the gunner and picks up the staff before Luke tells her to point the cannon at the deck. A far off view of that full scene being filmed can be found in some behind the scenes footage.\nPromotional photos of the attack were released and one was adapted for one panel of the Marvel Comics adaptation of the film. A 1984 coloring book includes an image of the scene shown from the opposite angle the photos use. The scene was also adapted in the second issue of the Star Wars Manga: Return of the Jedi comic series.",
