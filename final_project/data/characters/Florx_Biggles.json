 "content": "Florx Biggles was a male Ugnaught mechanic that loved droids. After Lando Calrissian was attacked by his own protocol droid DRX-7, Calrissian recruited Biggles to travel with him and Kaasha Bateen onboard the Lady Luck to find the Phylanx Redux Transmitter. While they traveled to Chandrila to recruit Han Solo, Biggles stayed on the ship to fix DRX-7, who was still trying to harm Calrissian due to being tampered with by Fyzen Gor.",
