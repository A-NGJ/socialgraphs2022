 "content": "Di'Reni was a Twi'lek female bartender who worked at Club Lazuli in Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica. Her club was under the protection of the Sixth Kin criminal organization, led by Wen Delphis. After the Sixth Kin lieutenant Ariole Yu and the sniper Just Lucky were sent by Delphis to collect a debt from Koz in Club Lazuli, De'Reni watched from behind the bar, speaking with Lucky while Yu fought with several of Koz's associates. When the situation devolved into a shootout, De'Reni retrieved a blaster and fired upon Koz's henchmen as Koz himself was pursued from the establishment by the Sixth Kin operatives.",
