 "content": "Dakka Fasser was a female Human lieutenant who worked for the Security Police on Etti IV.\nIn 3 BBY, she was present at the Stark Compound to arrest Jahan Cross for the murder of Dah'lis Stark. When Cross protested, stating the evidence against him was fake, she told the Imperial agent that he was being prosecuted because Iaclyn Stark wanted him to be charged. She continued her investigation only to be interrupted when Cross escaped his confinement and stole a speeder bike. She ordered all her troops to stop him. . After Cross was shot down during his escape, Fasser viewed the crash site and demanded that evidence be found that Cross had perished in the wreck. She refused to be held accountable for the damage and promised to place the blame on Myrsk and Dimity.",
