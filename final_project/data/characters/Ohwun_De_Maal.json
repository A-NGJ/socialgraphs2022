 "content": "Ohwun De Maal was a member of the Duros species. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Ohwun was in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina alongside Baniss Keeg, another Duros.\nOhwun De Maal first appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, where he was played by Jon Berg, who was uncredited for the role. Berg also played another Duros, Baniss Keeg, and a Bith musician in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. This information was revealed in the \"Masters of the Empire\" panel at Celebration V in August 2010.\nIn Star Wars Legends, Ohwun De Maal was originally identified as Ellorrs Madak. In the Star Wars Gamer 2 article The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Duros released in February 2001, Madak and his partner Baniss Keeg were identified as Owhun De Maal and Chachi De Maal, a Duros couple that had previously appeared in Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley as the owners of the famous Docking Bay 94. It was clarified that the names Baniss Keeg and Ellorrs Madak were aliases used by the couple, and the article also established that the Duros known as \"Bringe\" in the 1994 source book Star Wars Screen Entertainment was also Ohwun De Maal.",
