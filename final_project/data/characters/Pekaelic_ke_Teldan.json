 "content": "Pekaelic ke Teldan was the Perator of Cartann, the largest and most powerful nation on Adumar, until 13 ABY.\nIn his youth, he was a famed fighter ace, piloting the customized Blade-28 fighter Golden Yoke. In 13 ABY, he was convinced, probably with little difficulty, to declare himself Perator of all of Adumar by rogue New Republic diplomat Tomer Darpen. In addition to Perator he assumed the honorific titles of \"Hero of Lameril Ridge\", \"Master of the Golden Yoke\", and \"Smiter of the Tetano.\"\nAfter his defeat in the brief Adumari Civil War that resulted, Pekaelic refused to surrender even in the face of certain death. However, General Wedge Antilles convinced him to instead abdicate the throne. His eldest son, Balass ke Teldan, succeeded him as Perator of Cartann.",
