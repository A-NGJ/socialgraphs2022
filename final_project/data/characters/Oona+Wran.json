 "content": "Oona Wran was a male Bothan who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Oona Wran was present on the planet Dathomir when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility. The Blackwing virus that was studied there escaped containment and decimated most of the people in the area, turning them into starving undead creatures. In response, the Galactic Empire promptly established a Quarantine Zone to contain the infection. The few people who survived the initial virus outbreak, including Oona Wran, were trapped in the Quarantine Zone. The survivors established camps in order to to repel the regular assaults of the zombies and try to live in safety while waiting for an evacuation.\nDuring his time in the Quarantine Zone, Oona Wran discovered that canisters containing Blackwing virus were scattered throughout the zone during the outbreak. Furthermore, the canisters were leaking and releasing more virus in the area, representing a threat to the rescue teams landing in the area. The Bothan therefore visited four of the five refugee camp built by the survivors in the Quarantine Zone, Camps Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, to find assistance in destroying the canisters. Oona Wran recruited several spacers who ventured into the Quarantine Zone and provided them with thermal detonator. The adventurers eventually succeeded in blowing up all the leaking canisters.\nOona Wran was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Oona Wran was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", a.k.a. the \"Death Troopers\" update, released on October 12, 2009.",
