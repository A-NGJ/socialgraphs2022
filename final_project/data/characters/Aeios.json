 "content": "Aeios was a male Zabrak, who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nAeios worked for Alina Impeveri on Cularin. When Impeveri was tried to find the crashed podracer Skall Delos, she wanted to put anyone else who was searching for him off the trail. So to this end she placed Force illusions on Aeios, the Sullustan Tot and the Human Naren to make them all resemble Delos. The illusion masking Aeios was weaker than that of Naren, but stronger than that of Tot.",
