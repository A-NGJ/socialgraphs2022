 "content": "Reece Tallent was a human male soldier who fought the Galactic Empire as part of Saw Gerrera's extremist movement. He had a mutual resentment for Jyn Erso, and suffered a humiliating defeat in a spar against her. Reece and his crew were known to be loud and obnoxious, and many looked forward to their departure from the Wrea outpost. However, he would later return to receive training under Saw, becoming one of his fervent supporters.\nAfter discovering Jyn's real identity as Galen Erso's daughter, Reece betrayed Gerrera at Tamsye Prime, leaving Saw with major injuries and the decision to abandon Jyn.",
