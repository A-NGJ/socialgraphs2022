 "content": "Jander Bibbbi was a male Sullustan who worked for the crime lord Nirama during the time of the Clone Wars, serving as the captain of the YT-1300 light freighter Jackpot. Whilst on an assignment in the Cularin system asteroid belt, the Jackpot encountered a number of shadow lurkers—the incoporeal spirits of the Oblee species—which attempted to communicate with the crew of the Jackpot. However, their attempts were unsuccessful and instead caused the crew members to disappear. Bibbbi noticed that the creatures were repulsed by fusion lanterns, so he gathered a number of the lanterns and locked himself inside a concealed hold.",
