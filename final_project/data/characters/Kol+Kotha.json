 "content": "The male Gran Kol Kotha led a dangerous life, and years of piracy and smuggling had hardened him. His dealing of illegal arms in the Outer Rim attracted the attention of Borvo the Hutt on Naboo. In need of Kol's extensive weapons knowledge and piloting skills, Borvo hired him as a mercenary.\nWhen Naboo was invaded in 32 BBY, Borvo allied with Captain Kael and Gavyn Sykes of the Royal Naboo Security Forces. The two pilots had rescued Borvo's personal transport, which Kotha was flying at the time. Kotha then went on to fly several missions for the resistance in his starfighter. When Borvo betrayed the resistance and began selling the Naboo as slaves, however, Kotha allied with Sykes and helped destroy his former employer's operation.\nAfterwards Kol assisted in freeing several more officers and pilots from Camp Four in order to increase the resistance movement against the Trade Federation. He continued to fight along side Sykes and the Naboo until the Federation was eventually defeated.\nIn the video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo, Kotha's voice was provided by Terence McGovern.",
