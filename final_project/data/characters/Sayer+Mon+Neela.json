 "content": "Sayer Mon Neela was a female Human Bureaucrat of the Galactic Republic and later joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn the days before Palpatine became Supreme Chancellor, Neela befriended Bothan Senator Polo Se'lab. She vocally opposed Palpatine's policies, and quickly went underground after the formation of the Galactic Empire.\nShe, her sons, and her aide Raan Stasheff eventually joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Neela became a tactician, and her sons were soldiers that died in combat. Neela and Stasheff hid on the Alliance base on the planet Horob, which was working on a prototype sensor. However, the Empire tracked them to Horob and destroyed the base, capturing Neela and Stasheff aboard the Imperial Hazard. Neela eventually managed to escape to the Starcrossed and return to the Alliance with a version of the sensor, but Stasheff was injured in the attempt.\nShe later became the tactical officer for the Alliance base on Carosi XII, where she was reunited with her friend Se'lab.",
