 "content": "Mol Ni'mai was a male Bothan master armorsmith who designed the Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor . He lived in a hut in the northern mountains of the planet Dantooine during the Galactic Civil War, sometime after the Battle of Yavin.\nHe was visited by a spacer and fellow armorsmith during this time who wished to learn the secret of crafting the R.I.S. armor. After a payment of 50,000 credits, Ni'mai instructed the spacer on the basics of the armor's construction. Once Ni'mai was satisfied that the spacer had learned the essentials and had seen the spacer's armorsmithing prowess firsthand, he gave the spacer schematics for each piece of the R.I.S. armor.\nA brown-furred male Bothan, Mol Ni'mai was a master armorsmith and designer of the Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor. He lived alone in a small hut in the northern mountains of the planet Dantooine during the Galactic Civil War sometime after the Battle of Yavin.\nHe was visited by a spacer and fellow armorsmith during this time who wished to learn how to construct the R.I.S. armor. Ni'mai demanded 50,000 credits from the spacer before he would even begin instructing. The spacer paid the fee, and Ni'mai began by instructing the spacer in the creation of the armor segment, which provided the armor its protection. The armor segment required bones from a woolamander harrower for strength, the hide of a gurk king for flexibility, and for inner protection and warmth, the scales of a great dune kimogila. The armor's appearance layer was next, requiring the feathers of a peko-peko albatross. Once Ni'mai was satisfied that his student had learned the basics of the armor's construction, he told the spacer to craft a complete pair of the R.I.S. boots, which the spacer did. Ni'mai considered the boots adequate and rewarded his student with the schematics for the remainder of the R.I.S. armor pieces.\nMol Ni'mai was arrogant, believing himself to be the greatest master armorsmith in the galaxy and refusing to even speak more than a few sentences to those of lesser comprehension in the art of armor crafting. When he did find someone he considered teaching, he was condescending to his pupil and critical of his or her work. He demanded strict obedience from his students. Ni'mai declared that R.I.S. armor was his masterpiece invention and that all other armors were junk in comparison.\nMol Ni'mai was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Mol Ni'mai was added to the game with the \"Publish 4,\" released on November 13, 2003. Mol Ni'mai initiated a quest that taught the player, playing as a spacer, to create the Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor. The player had to be a master armorsmith to receive the quest.",
