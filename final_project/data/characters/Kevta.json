 "content": "Kevta was a male Human miner who sympathized with the Workers of New Apsolon. In 41 BBY, he, along with Yanci and Bini were confused by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and Eritha, believing that they were members of the Absolutes. The trio attacked them, and injured Obi-Wan. When Kevta and his allies realized that they were wrong, Yanci offered her medical knowledge to cure Kenobi's leg. When the Padawan was better, Kenobi, Jinn and Eritha left the mining facility. Some time later, Kevta was killed when the Absolutes attacked the mine.",
