 "content": "Karl Eckener was a Human male who lived on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War. Karl was the son of Hugo Eckener and a gambler.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Karl Eckener ran up huge gambling debts to both the Skaak Tippers and the Darkwalker criminal groups. He was finally kidnapped and his father was forced to work to pay off Karl's gambling debts. Nevertheless, Karl Eckener was never freed by the criminals. In 1 ABY, Hugo Eckener was forced to request RSF agents to assault the Darkwalker Cave to liberate his son.\nKarl Eckener appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011. Karl Eckener was added to the game as part of the \"Legacy Quest\" with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
