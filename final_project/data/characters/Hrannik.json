 "content": "Hrannik was a Shamed One living beneath the surface of Coruscant, after the planet was captured and transformed into Yuuzhan'tar. Although a heretic, Hrannik was one of the few Shamed Ones who lived independently of the larger groups, ensuring that their small cult of Jedi followers would never be fully discovered. Hrannik spent much of her time spreading the knowledge of the Jedi to others in hopes of the heresy to the higher ranks.",
