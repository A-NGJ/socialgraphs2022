 "content": "Buggles was a male voorpak owned by Torra Doza, a resident of the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon. He remained close by his owner Torra's side. Buggles was involved in a few low stake adventures aboard the Colossus. During the Battle of Castilon, Buggles helped Torra find Team Colossus leader Kazuda Xiono.\nBuggles was a pet voorpak owned by Torra Doza, the teenage daughter of Captain Imanuel Doza, the administrator of the Colossus station. In her free time, Doza enjoyed playing and relaxing with Buggles. BB-8 once encountered Buggles loose in the Colossus marketplace, and was followed by Buggles into Aunt Z's Tavern. Buggles subsequently nearly tripped up Lin Gaava while she was exiting her booth.\nLater Torra, annoyed at being confined to her bedroom by her father, used Buggles to escape from the droid 4D-M1N by giving him to her, explaining that he needed to be take out or else he would have another accident indoors. After 4D-M1N left, Torra slipped out of her bedroom as she had deduced the passcode, but her presence in the hallway was given away when Buggles saw her over 4D's shoulder and reacted. The droid was prevented from chasing after Torra, however, when Buggles then urinated on the floor. When Torra later returned to her room, accompanied by Kazuda Xiono, Buggles was present while they played Flight Simulator Squadron. After Xiono left Doza Tower after a series of events, Torra cuddled her pet while wondering what he was hiding.\nSometime later Torra asked Xiono to watch Buggles at Jarek Yeager's Repair Station while she was busy. However, the Voorpak escaped Xiono, first eating the contents of a bowl before running outside and hopping onto the precarious structures at the very edge of the platform, with Xiono in pursuit. He nearly managed to catch Buggles before the pet bounded off again, to his dismay. When Torra returned in search of Buggles, Xiono evaded her question of where he was. The voorpak had gotten into the cockpit of the Fireball, and managed to launch the starship by randomly pressing buttons. Torra asked who was piloting the ship, and Xiono was forced to admit it was Buggles, to her horror.\nBuggles was present when Torra brought her friends Kaz, Tamara Ryvora, and the undercover pirate spy Synara San to her room for a game of Drone-Blaster. Later that night, Buggles was in Torra's room when the pirates Drell and Valik infiltrated the room and kidnapped Torra. The First Order, who had engineered the kidnapping, later rescued Torra and used the incident to force Captain Doza to allow the First Order to occupy the Colossus.\nBuggles remained by her owner Torra's side during the First Order's occupation of the Colossus. Buggles was sitting beside Torra when a group of stormtroopers marched past Torra's quarters. One of these stormtroopers was an undercover Kaz who had stolen a data rod from the First Order containing intelligence on their fleet movements.\nWhen Neeku Vozo, Kaz, Jarek Yeager, and the Chelidae sank the Colossus in order to disable the First Order's jammer and contact the Resistance, Torra scurried to her quarters with Buggles.\nAfter Commander Pyre arrested Captain Doza, Torra sent Buggles on a mission to find Xiono in the Colossus. Buggles found Kaz and the BB-series astromech droid CB-23 and led them to the trapdoor where Torra was hiding. After fighting off the First Order BB series droid MB-13A, Torra, Kaz, and CB-23 embarked on a mission to free Yeager, Captain Doza, and Tam Ryvora.\nDuring the mission to Celsor 3, Buggles stowed away on the Fireball, much to Kazuda's frustration. During the skirmish with the jakoosk, Buggles ran off, causing Torra to run after him. After the jakoosk was taken down by Kaz, Buggles reappeared, climbing on top of the jakoosk before being picked up by Torra.\nFollowing the rescue of Tamara Ryvora, Buggles joined several Colossus residents including Aunt Z, Bolza Grool, Opeepit, Garma, Mika Grey, Kel, Eila, and Grevel in celebrating the defeat of the First Order forces that had been pursuing them.\nBuggles was a male Voorpak with tan fur and blue eyes. Buggles was playful, a little mischievous, and had a close bond with his master Torra Doza. He was intelligent enough to find Torra's friend Kaz and bring him to her during the Escape of the Colossus.\nBuggles was first mentioned in the 2018 book Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy, which was written by Amy Ratcliffe. Buggles first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance episode \"Secrets and Holograms\", which premiered on December 2, 2018. Buggles' design was based on concept art developed by Terryl Whitlatch for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. The title of the short \"Buggle's Day Out\", in which he plays a prominent role, misspells his name in the process of misplacing an apostrophe.",
