 "content": "Quat Ralto was the first officer and security chief of the Bright Seeker mining survey ship. He was a stern, competent man with a strict honor code. Although he was a member of a House Calipsa crew he made a point of treating all aboard the ship with respect.\nHe was killed by Janos Marsh when Ralto interrupted him contacting the rival House Melantha in the transceiver room of the Bright Seeker. Janos acted instinctively killing him with a low-powered blaster shot to the head. His wound was still smoking when his body was discovered by other members of the Bright Seeker crew.",
