 "content": "Kordus Vrak was a Shistavanen male explorer. Despite the appearance of his species, Vrak was often gentle and calm. Vrak was one of several crew members hired by Fionn Tucat and Romina Foss for an expedition to the abandoned moon of Lupal. However, the red light from the solar flares of the moon's star turned Vrak into a feral beast, and drove him to kill his fellow crew. The Lasat Borzul attacked Vrak, allowing fellow crewmembers Romina Foss and RF-U5 to escape aboard their starship before leaping aboard himself, leaving Vrak behind.",
