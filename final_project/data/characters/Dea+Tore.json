 "content": "Dea Tore was a Human female doctor who stayed on Naboo during the Galactic Civil War.\nDea Tore appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Dr. Tore would have been on Naboo. However, Dr. Tore is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what she would have looked like if she were added to the game.",
