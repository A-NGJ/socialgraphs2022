 "content": "Pirtonna worked as an enforcer for the Birtraub Brothers Storage and Reclamation Center on Crovna, in 0.5 ABY, during the height of the Galactic Empire.\nIt was Pirtonna who found Mara Jade, when she arrived at the Reclamation Center during her investigation of Moff Glovstoak. Pirtonna escorted Jade to his boss's office, then tried to pull his blaster in an attempt to strong-arm her. Mara, however, wanted nothing to do with such amateur tactics, and quickly disarmed Birtraub before he could do any damage.",
