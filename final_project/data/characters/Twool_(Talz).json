In this year he traveled to the planet Kashyyyk with fellow slavers Nishrah and Lix, hoping to capture a number of Wookiee younglings to sell. The group landed in the Shadowlands, the forest floor of Kashyyyk, where they encountered a group of young Wookiees lead by Chewbacca. Hoping to catch the young group the slavers attack, but were eventually beaten by the group. Twool and Nishrah were captured when adult Wookiees arrived in the Shadowlands and Lix was killed while trying to escape.",
