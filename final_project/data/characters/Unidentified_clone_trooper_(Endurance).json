 "content": "This clone trooper was stationed onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance when Boba Fett infiltrated the ship in an attempt to kill Mace Windu. He was killed by Fett's booby trap upon entering Windu's quarters.\nThis clone trooper served onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance. At one point, the clone received orders from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker to locate Jedi Master Mace Windu and bring him to the bridge immediately. The trooper found Windu just outside his quarters, and although Windu initially replied that he would be there shortly, the trooper insisted that Skywalker needed him immediately. Windu sighed and then gave the trooper a datacard to place in his quarters for him while he went to see Skywalker. The trooper obliged, taking the datacard and stepping into Windu's quarters.\nHowever, the bounty hunter Boba Fett had secretly infiltrated the Endurance, disguised as the clone cadet \"Lucky.\" He had set a booby trap on Windu's quarters, seeking revenge for the death of his father Jango, who Windu had beheaded at the First Battle of Geonosis. The trooper set off the trip wire and was slammed across into the wall. Mace used the force to pull the clone out of the wrecked room and into his arms, but his body was completely limp. Mace removed the trooper's helmet and asked the trooper if he was alright. However, the clone was unresponsive and soon died of his injuries in Windu's arms.\nThe clone first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season One episode \"Death Trap.\" Like all clones in the series, he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.",
