 "content": "Homuhr was a male Aqualish who worked on the Rig in the Stenness Node during the Clone Wars.\nDuring the infiltration of the Rig by Jedi seeking to bring down the Crimson Nova, Saesee Tiin arrived aboard in the guise of a mercenary, and was greeted by Homuhr. He told Tiin he would look at his stock and offer him a price. The Jedi later detonated an explosive planted aboard his ship, which destroyed a large portion of the hangar bay. It is unknown if Homuhr was caught in the blast.\n\"Homuhr\" is taken from the Aurebesh tag on the Aqualish's overalls, which is presumably his name.",
