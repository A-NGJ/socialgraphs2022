 "content": "Honn Dangel was a Meri meteorologist working in Cloud City.\nHailing from the planet Merisee, Honn Dangel found that he had little talent for the traditional fields of either medicine or agriculture. He spent his youth in the planet's military and then began traveling through the galaxy once he was discharged. Dangel used his military skills to earn a living until he arrived on Cloud City in the Bespin system.\nDangel soon discovered that his species' innate talent of being able to predict the weather was a valuable asset in a city that was plagued by wind storms. Applying for a post as a meteorologist, Dangel was rejected because he had no formal training. However, after publicly predicting several storms—including some that the Storm Guard had failed to forecast—he was was quickly offered a post.\nDangel's career proved to be successful. Using his natural ability, Dangel soon became a shift supervisor with the Storm Guard and worked the first night shift in the watch station located at the top of Kerros Tower.\nDangel was a tall Meri with dark blue skin and a pronounced ridge above the eyebrows. He had webbed hands and possessed a graceful movement style. Like all Meris, Dangel had the innate talent of predicting the weather which allowed him to become a meteorologist on Cloud City despite having no formal training. When not on duty, Dangel continued to sample the weather while in the open and spent much of his free time at various sporting arenas.\nDangel carried a comlink and a ground alert alarm activator.",
