 "content": "Vylip F'alma was a Northern Mustafarian male who was the lore master of his clan. He was eventually imprisoned in Fortress Vader. He helped ZO-E3 and a smuggler escape Vader's castle and told them of the Bright Star. After acquiring the Bright Star he betrayed them by handing it to Vader, thinking it would save the planet. However, Vader threw them down a dark hole after acquiring the artifact. Realizing his mistake, Vylip tried to make it up to them by saying they should band together and fight. He was eaten and killed by the Darkghast shortly after.\nVylip F'alma is a character created for Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series, a three-part virtual reality series created by ILMxLAB. He was voiced by voice actor Keith Ferguson.",
