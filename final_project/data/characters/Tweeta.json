 "content": "Tweeta was a Rodian female smuggler who worked with the Galactic Republic army during the Cold War. She stayed on the planet Ord Mantell during part of the war, where she aided in the fight against the Mantellian Separatist Movement in the Ord Mantell Civil War.\nTweeta was a Rodian female who worked as a smuggler during the Cold War, a conflict between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Republic. During the war, she helped the Galactic Republic's army and worked with them on the planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system of the Mid Rim,. While stationed on the planet she and all Republic forces aided the corrupt local government in fighting the Mantellian Separatist Movement.\nDuring the civil war she stayed in Fort Garnik, a Republic stronghold on the planet, where she worked with another Rodian named Wentell Pron. Pron was looking to make new connections in the smuggling world whilst on the planet and Tweeta would direct anyone she met who she suspected shared her trade to him.\nTweeta at one point in the war directed a Smuggler who worked with Rendia Freight to Wentell. The smuggler paid the Rodian at least once to teach them a number of combat and smuggling techniques.\nDuring her time at Garnik Tweeta wore a gray suit and matching pants with brown boots. She was armed with a blaster pistol which he kept attached to his belt at the hip when not in use.\nTweeta is a Non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. She directs characters of the Smuggler class to the games first smuggler class trainer and the only one on Ord Mantell. It is not possible for players of the Imperial faction to interact with Tweeta as there is currently no way Imperial characters can travel to Ord Mantell.",
