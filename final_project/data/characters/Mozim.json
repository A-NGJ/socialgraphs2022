 "content": "Mozim was a male Argullian who lived on Argul during the Clone Wars.\nMozim was a member of the government of Argul and he held the title Administrator and the position of Undersecretary of Commerce. During the Battle of Argul, most of the Argullian government was evacuated and Mozim was the highest ranking official left on the planet. He wanted the Jedi on Argul to order a retreat to the last docking tower thee not to be captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, even though this would risk the lives of Republic troops, the Jedi and injured Argullian citizens. His motive for his plan was to keep part of the Argullian government, and so himself, alive, even though they had already been evacuated.",
