 "content": "Scover Byne was a female Bivall who was the owner of the Byne Guild, an organization that handled shipping throughout the Galactic Frontier during the High Republic Era. Byne was the foster mother of the Guild pilot Affie Hollow, whom she was training to help take responsibility over the Guild. Byne often traveled on the Guild freighter Legacy Run. After the Legacy Run was destroyed in the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Hollow worried for Byne's safety. Byne was later arrested and her Guild dissolved after Hollow turned her in to Galactic Republic authorities for abusing laws regarding indentured servitude after she discovered that Byne had been forcing her indentured laborers to take on extremely dangerous work in exchange for shortened indentures.\nScover Byne appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Into the Dark, written by Claudia Gray.",
