 "content": "Kybacca was a female Wookiee, and was a senior senator in the New Republic. She opposed allowing former Imperials to serve in the Senate. When translated into Galactic Basic Standard, the suffix in Kybacca's name, \"Bacca,\" meant \"Ally/Friend/Sister.\"\nKybacca was first mentioned in the Star Wars Encyclopedia, authored by Stephen J. Sansweet, and published by Del Rey in 1998. The Encyclopedia sources the entry to Kristine Kathryn Rusch's 1996 novel, The New Rebellion. However, the novel makes no mention of any Kybacca. Instead, it is Kerrithrarr who is the senior Wookiee senator, and who is one of the few senators to oppose the election of former Imperial officials to New Republic positions.",
