 "content": "Anky Fremp was the name of a Skup who lived on Level 88 in the Corellian Sector on the moon of Nar Shaddaa. As a biomorph, Anky had a natural talent for stealing, and made an ample career for himself as a professional thief.\nIn 2 BBY he met the seventeen-year-old Rodian known as Greedo. Anky taught Greedo the secret to living on the streets of Nar Shaddaa. He taught him how to steal, how to negotiate on the black market, and how to avoid the Corellian Port Control. Anky introduced Greedo to a ship merchant named Shug Ninx and his assistant Warb. Anky would occasionally throw some business Shug's way by stealing power couplings and therm pumps from other ships and selling them to him at a discount rate. Anky was present the day Greedo attempted to steal two Dekk-6 power couplings from a YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon. Unfortunately for Greedo, the ship's pilot and co-pilot, Han Solo and Chewbacca the Wookiee intercepted him. Shortly after this incident, Anky parted company with Greedo who preferred to live the life of a bounty hunter rather than that of a thief on the streets of Nar Shaddaa. Anky continued to ply his trade selling stolen ship parts to Shug Ninx.\nAnky Fremp resembled a typical Sionian Skup. He was a near-Human of short stature with \"small, closely spaced eyes, hair as brittle as glass and skin the color of Dianoga cheese\".",
