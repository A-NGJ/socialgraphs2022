 "content": "Skawn Bonduna was a male Twi'lek scholar and musician who performed in the band, Sonic Free. When the Galactic Empire came to power, Bonduna was targeted by the Imperial Board of Culture under accusations that the band was using subliminal messages to plant ideas of rebellion in listeners mind.\nA white-skinned Twi'lek, Skawn Bonduna was born during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. As an educated teenager, Bonduna formed a band called Sonic Free; not only did he perform in the band but Bonduna conducted the band's business affairs as well. As part of the appeal of Bonduna's music, the Twi'lek incorporated subliminal messaging to enhance the mood of the listeners.\nWhen the Galactic Empire came to power under the rule of Emperor Palpatine, Bonduna and his band mates were targeted by the Imperial Board of Culture under the charges of spurning rebellion. The IBC falsely claimed the band used subliminal messaging to coerce their listeners into rebellious acts against the Empire. The majority of the band was arrested and convicted and sentenced to serve time in an Imperial prison facility. While incarcerated, Bonduna's band mates were all killed in a suspicious brawl. Escaping the prison, Bonduna managed to evade capture and fled to the Mid Rim where he was spotted and a hefty bounty was placed on his head. Skawn Bonduna remained at large throughout the Galactic Civil War.\nIn Slugthrowers: An Overview of Popular Music and Musicians in a Galaxy Far, Far Away, a 2013 article written by Edward M. Erdelac for the official StarWars.com blog, the character was mistakenly referred to as \"Skwan Bonduna.\"",
