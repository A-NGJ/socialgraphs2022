 "content": "Lonai's father was a male Kumumgah who lived on Tatooine with his son during the Pre-Republic era. He and his son was among the survivors that were brought before Predor Tul'kar and Xesh during the culling of Force-sensitives. When Xesh sensed the Force within his son Lonai and caused his death, Lonai's father was devastated because of the scene and angrily declared to Predor Tul'kar that the Kumumgah would someday drive the Rakata away from Tatooine by fighting back. Amused, Predor Tul'kar stated that it was unlikely to occur before shocking Lonai's father to death.",
