 "content": "Shyla Merricope was a Human female Corellian Diktat who worked with Garm Bel Iblis to prevent the coming war from spilling over into the Corellian system.\nIn 22 BBY, in the months leading up to the Clone Wars, Shyla Merricope and Senator Iblis withdrew the Corellian sector from the Galactic Republic in protest of the Military Creation Act. Since the Corellians proved to be one of the harshest critics against the Grand Army that the Republic established. After the announcement of Corellia's withdrawal, Shyla stated at a press conference since she couldn't allow other worlds to use their own security units to battle against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She was later replaced by Dupas Thomree.",
