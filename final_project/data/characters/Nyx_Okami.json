 "content": "Nyx Okami was a young mechanic who lived in the lower levels of Coruscant during the Clone Wars. During this time, he encountered and became romantically involved with former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano.\nAt one point in time, Nyx had borrowed money from Pintu, a moneylender with harsh punishments for delayed payments. Some time later, during the Clone Wars, Nyx got an unexpected visit by a young Togruta called Ahsoka Tano who crash-landed her speeder bike on the landing pad of his shop. After introducing themselves, Ahsoka wanted Nyx to repair her bike. Suddenly, Pintu came barging into the shop with two henchmen. Pintu demanded to receive his overdue payment from Nyx, but the latter tried to wriggle his way out by saying that the payment was coming soon. Pintu was not convinced and made his two bodyguards teach Okami a lesson. A fight broke out and Nyx was outmatched so he pleaded to Ahsoka to get help. She bargained with him instead and asked to have the bike repaired and to live there free of charge. Nyx was at first hesitant, but after getting beaten some more he agreed to her deal. Ahsoka was quickly able to chase them away with Pintu declaring that it was not over. Afterward, they became fast allies, confronting crime in the criminal underworld of Coruscant, and may have even formed a romantic relationship, though it ultimately amounted to nothing.\nPrior to the cancellation of The Clone Wars TV series, Nyx Okami was to appear in a four-episode arc starring Ahsoka Tano. During the \"Ahsoka's Untold Tales\" panel at Celebration Europe in 2016, Dave Filoni said that Nyx was an attempt to bring an Asian male lead to the forefront of a series voiced by Matthew Yang King.\nWhen The Clone Wars was revived for a seventh and final season, Nyx Okami's character no longer played a major role. During the \"Clone Wars Saved\" panel in 2019, it was revealed that two new characters, Trace and Rafa Martez, were taking his place in the story arc featuring Tano.",
