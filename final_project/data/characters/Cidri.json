 "content": "Cidri was a Bothan jeweler who lived on Cloud City, a floating mining colony in the atmosphere of the gas giant Bespin, at some point between the years 1 ABY and 3 ABY. By this time, Cidri was married to another Bothan jeweler named Henna, and the pair ran a jewelry business named Bothawui Jewellers together. The pair's business was run out of a weathered JumpMaster 5000 starship set up on Market Row, a commercial corridor in Cloud City's Port Town district.\nCidri first appeared in The Jewel of Yavin, an adventure module released in 2014 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game. The jeweler is listed as a merchant players can purchase goods from, but no specific interactions are listed and the Bothan's gender is not stated.",
