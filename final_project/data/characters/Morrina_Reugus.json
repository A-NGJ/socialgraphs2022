 "content": "Morrina Reugus worked at Brentaal IV spaceport during the Galactic Civil War as a senior traffic controller.\nAfter her parents were accused of smuggling weapons and executed by the Galactic Empire, she went to live with relatives on Brentaal. She started working in the spaceport and worked her way up to the position of senior starport traffic controller. Morrina joined the Rebel Alliance and developed an informal code system using specific phrases to identify ships friendly to the Alliance. Using her position of a starport traffic controller, and working with Sarchen Snyle, another Rebel sympathizer, she would ensured that ships bound for Alliance bases were not searched.\nReugus was dedicated to her job, and would help other controllers in their duties. She kept her uniform tidy and wore her long brown hair in a bun when on-duty.",
