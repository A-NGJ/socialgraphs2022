 "content": "Gillen Finders was an Imperial Army trooper who fought on the planet Mimban in the 224th Imperial Armored Division.\nGillen Finders was a human male Imperial Army trooper who served in the Galactic Empire. He was a specialist trained as a combat medic who was deployed alongside the 224th Imperial Armored Division to Mimban to fight in the Mimban Campaign. He and Sergeant Mattiso Trodu notably attended to Corporal Chakobi Sanwright, who was heavily concussed during a particularly explosive attack by the Mimbanese Liberation Army.\nHe, along with the other healers on Mimban, attacked the Mimbanese resistance without scruples, as medical oaths dictated that the healers needed only attend to their own species.",
