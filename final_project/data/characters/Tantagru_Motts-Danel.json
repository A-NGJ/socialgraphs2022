 "content": "Tantagru Motts-Danel was a Tarnab sandsculptor who was born in a colony of his species on the Weequay homeworld of Sriluur. He eventually married the Weequay Gojuni Motts-Danel, and the pair became notable in the corporate art scene, specializing in holography and abstract art. During the final decades of the Galactic Republic, Tantagru produced an advertisement for the InterGalactic Banking Clan titled \"Invest Wisely\", although the clan's advertising campaigns came to be considered creatively compromised as they consisted of an unsuccessful mix of metaphors, Muun iconography, Banking Clan hardware and words of encouragement that came off as distant and disconnected to the viewer.\nTantagru Motts-Danel was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.",
