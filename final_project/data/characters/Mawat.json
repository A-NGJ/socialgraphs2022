 "content": "Mawat was a male Human member of the Young on the planet Melida/Daan. While initially he followed the leaders Nield and Cerasi, soon after peace was declared he began to crave power. Mawat began arming both members of the Young as well as the Elders, to attempt to escalate the conflict on the planet. This attempt to create conflict both succeeded and failed, however; one of the sharpshooters armed and placed by Mawat shot Cerasi, causing the leaders on both sides grief.\nHowever, Mawat pressed on with his mission. Conflict was inevitable, until former Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, Nield, and Cerasi's father interceded. Mawat and his followers laid down their weapons, and the Last Battle of Zehava was over.",
