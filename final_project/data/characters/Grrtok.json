 "content": "Grrtok was a male Gamorrean who was the leader of a mercenary group called Grrtok's Band. During the Galactic Civil War, Grrtok was a warrior well past his prime, but still a formidable combatant by other species' standards. By the low standards of Gamorrean society, he was considered to be educated, and was a brilliant tactician who was well respected by the warriors that he led.\nGrrtok's Band consisted of a collection of about 400 heavily-armed Gamorreans. Grrtok traveled the galaxy looking for other Gamorreans to join his group and in some cases freed them from slavers. Grrtok ran the mercenary group much like the familial clans of the Gamorrean homeworld of Gamorr. His group was contracted out to House Barnaba of the Tapani sector.",
