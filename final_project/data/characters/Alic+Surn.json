 "content": "Alic Surn was a human male and one half of one of the most famous brother and sister bounty hunter teams, alongside his older sister, Vika Surn. They operated through House Neuvalis, hunting in the Inner Rim.\nThe Surns paid the Neuvalis syndicate a five percent gap in exchange for the use of their transport ship, a modified Incom scout ship named Widow Maker.\nAlic was an easygoing gambler who tried to enjoy his life, since he thought it would probably end soon. His main concerns were the present and his sister's safety. He played and worked hard, not worrying about the future. In any situation where killing was necessary, Alic always deferred to his sister. Alic and Vika complemented each other well: Vika was a steadying influence on her brother, while Alic helped his sister deal with the emotional disorders that led to her frequent outbursts of anger against friend or foe.",
