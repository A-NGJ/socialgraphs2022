 "content": "Bini was female Human miner who sympathized with the Workers of the planet New Apsolon.\nWhen Bini and her companions Yanci and Kevta first met Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and Eritha, they erroneously thought that they were members of their enemies the Absolutes, and so attacked them. Obi-Wan was injured in the attack. When they realized that they had been mistaken, Yanci offered her medical knowledge to heal Kenobi's injured leg. Once the Padawan had been healed, he and his companions left the mining facility. Some time later the Absolutes attacked the mine, killing Bini in the process.",
