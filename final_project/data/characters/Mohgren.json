 "content": "Mohgren was a Human male who was a Sith Lord of the Sith Empire during the Galactic War. During the invasion of Belsavis in the Galactic War, Mohgren sought to free the mysterious prisoner Subject 13 from deep within the Tomb on Belsavis, but his expedition of slaves failed to reach the prisoner. Mohgren remotely recruited other Imperials in the area to locate Subject 13, who turned out to be a Rakata trapped in a mind prison, and Mohgren dispatched his apprentice Suvaar to facilitate the prisoner's escapeâ€”although that meant Suvaar had to offer his body for Subject 13 to possess.\nLord Mohgren is contacted via a holoterminal on Belsavis in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and provides Imperial players with the mission \"Subject 13.\"",
