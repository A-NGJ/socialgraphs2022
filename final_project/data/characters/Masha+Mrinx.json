 "content": "Masha Mrinx was a female Twi'lek who was part of an eight-man gang that crossed the Exchange sometime before their capture and incarceration by the Galactic Republic in the Belsavis prison. During the rioting that occurred when the Sith Empire attacked Belsavis, Mrinx was one of many prisoners that escaped, but she was hunted down and killed by a bounty hunter fulfilling the Exchange's contract on the gang.",
