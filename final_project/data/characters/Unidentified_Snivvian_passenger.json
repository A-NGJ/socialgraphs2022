 "content": "A Snivvian male individual made an attempt to leave the planet Saleucami shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire. Directly following a holographic broadcast by Imperial Vice Admiral Rampart, the passenger attempted to board a Star Commuter 2000 transport and was stopped by a clone trooper, who asserted to him the Empire's new chain code requirement for offworld travel. The Snivvian then protested that he had to get on the starship, attempting to resist the trooper and board the transport to no avail. After being pushed to the ground and told to get back in line by the clone trooper, the Snivvian left the scene. All of this was witnessed by clone defectors Hunter and Cut Lawquane.\nThe Snivvian passenger first appeared in \"Cut and Run\", the second episode of Star Wars: The Bad Batch. He was voiced by Noshir Dalal, who also voiced Vice Admiral Rampart.",
