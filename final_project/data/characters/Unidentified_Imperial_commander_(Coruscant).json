 "content": "This unidentified Imperial commander was stationed on Coruscant during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 0 ABY, shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader returned to Coruscant after crash landing on the desolate planet of Vaal. On the Sith Lord's arrival, he was greeted by an Imperial commander, who expressed his and his superior's concern about Vader's whereabouts. After being ordered to notify the Emperor about the fact that he had arrived and to send men to retrieve his ship, the commander noticed that Vader's suit had been damaged, revealing a cybernetic arm.\nVader quickly covered the damage and without any explanation gave the commander another order to send a new crew to the relay station on Vaal.",
