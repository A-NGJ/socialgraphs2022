 "content": "Erran Sif was a Human female spy who lived on Corellia and Talus during the Galactic Civil War. She was considered a Rebel by the Empire, but was in fact wanted by both sides.\nErran Sif began her career as a spy for the Empire. She was instructed to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance, but upon doing so, Imperial agents learned that she was selling both Rebel and Imperial information to the Hutts. When her treachery was revealed after the Battle of Yavin, Erran Sif realized that her life was at risk and fled from Corellia to the Twin World of Talus. There, she holed herself up in a secluded bunker, surrounding herself only with her most trusted associates. They consisted of a ruthless mercenary crew, including a number of Trandoshans and her two brothers, Hirsch and Doak. However, In 1 ABY, the Empire finally discovered the location of Erran Sif's secret hideout and exposed her identity so that she could be hunted down by bounty hunters or other denizens. The Bothan Spynet also shared this information.\nErran Sif was one of many Non-Player Characters in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players could go to her bunker and kill Erran Sif, though this was not part of a quest. The biography of Erran Sif was expanded upon in a short article titled \"10 Hot Spots Travel Guide\".",
