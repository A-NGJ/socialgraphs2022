 "content": "Duqua Dar was a Zabrak male Jedi Knight in the time of the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, which began in 3976 BBY. During the war, he served alongside fellow Zabrak Acaadi, allying himself with the Revanchists—a group of Jedi led by then-Jedi Knight Revan—who went against the orders of the Jedi Council and took an active role in the war. Revan led the Republic forces during the war but came to accept Sith teachings in the process.\nAt the start of the Jedi Civil War, which began when Darth Revan, by then a Dark Lord of the Sith, and his apprentice Darth Malak led an invasion of the Republic in 3959 BBY, Dar was fighting the remaining Mandalorians on his homeworld Iridonia. When Dar intercepted a group of Mandalorian mercenaries who had attacked a Republic communications center on the planet, he was aided by Acaadi, now a Sith agent, who used the encounter to persuade Dar to join him and the Sith. Dar and Acaadi traveled to the nearby town of Wortan, pursued by a group of Jedi and spacers working as agents for the Republic, who attempted to thwart Acaadi's plans. Tracking them back to Acaadi's personal hangar, the Republic agents attempted to convince Dar to reject the dark side, before being attacked by a number of Sith commandos under Acaadi's command.\nThe Zabrak male Duqua Dar was a Jedi Knight during the time of the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, beginning 3976 BBY. During the early part of the Mandalorian Wars, Dar joined the Revanchists—a group of Jedi led by then-Jedi Knight Revan—who went against the orders of the Jedi Council and took an active role in the conflict. Leading the Republic forces in the war, Revan discovered ancient Sith teachings and came to embrace them. As a member of the Revanchists, Dar served alongside fellow Zabrak Jedi Acaadi, before Acaadi's dedication to Revan eventually turned him to the dark side as well. Dar resisted the call of the dark side, however, and remained on the Zabrak homeworld of Iridonia, though he believed that his destiny lay elsewhere.\nAt the start of the Jedi Civil War, which began when Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan and his apprentice Darth Malak led an invasion of the Republic in 3959 BBY, Dar was fighting the remaining Mandalorians still present on Iridonia. Under orders from the Republic Military, Dar intercepted a group of Mandalorian mercenaries who had attacked a Republic communications center on the planet. The Mandalorians almost proved too much for Dar, but he was saved by the timely intervention of Acaadi, now a Sith agent, who used the encounter to persuade Dar to join him and possibly turn him to the dark side. Dar was convinced that the Jedi Order had been holding him back, preventing him from using his natural aggressive feelings. Unaware that it had been Acaadi who had ordered the Mandalorians to attack the communications center in preparation for a planned Sith attack on Iridonia, Dar decided to join Acaadi. The conversation between the two Zabrak was overheard via comlink by a group of Jedi and spacers under orders from the Republic, who had earlier defeated another group of Mandalorians that had ambushed them. Unaware that Dar had agreed to join Acaadi, they decided to go to Dar's aid.\nDar and Acaadi traveled to Acaadi's private hangar in the town of Wortan, with the Republic agents in pursuit. Reaching Wortan, the Republic agents searched the town for the two Zabrak and, with the help of two Force-users, Draethos Darok-Tho and Miraluka Jirany Sha, managed to locate Acaadi's hangar. Acaadi detected the group as they approached and planned to have the Republic agents meet with Dar in the hangar.\nJust as the agents arrived, Acaadi left the planet in his personal shuttle, heading to sabotage the flagship of the Republic fleet, the Hammerhead-class cruiser Champion of Iridonia, which was situated in orbit. Dar met with the Republic agents as Acaadi planned, who attempted to convince him to reject the dark side. During their conversation, Dar attempted to justify joining the Sith by pointing out holes in the Jedi teachings. After Dar talked with the Republic agents, a group of Sith commandos attacked the agents at Acaadi's command. The agents defeated the commandos, however, and proceeded to travel to the Champion of Iridonia in an attempt to save the Republic fleet from Acaadi.\nDuqua Dar was a conflicted Jedi, who, in the aftermath of the Mandalorian Wars, resisted the call of the dark side and remained on the Zabrak homeworld of Iridonia. At the same time, however, he believed that his destiny belonged elsewhere. Dar's mind and body bore the scars of the Mandalorian Wars, making him highly emotional and on edge. He was convinced that the Jedi Order had been holding him back, preventing him from using his natural aggressive feelings. When Acaadi persuaded Dar to join him, Dar attempted to justify joining the Sith by pointing out holes in the Jedi teachings.\nA native of Iridonia, Dar was able to speak both Zabraki and Basic.\nDuqua Dar was an experienced Jedi who had been trained in both the use of the Force as well as lightsaber combat. In combat, Dar preferred to concentrate on his lightsaber defenses, bolstered by the Force. He was skilled in telekinetic applications of the Force, able to move objects and create a whirlwind around an opponent. Dar could also hide his Force presence from other Force-users at will, allowing him to escape detection.\nDuqua Dar made his first appearance in Iridonian Darkness, a Wizards of the Coast online adventure for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, which was made available as a free download from Wizards.com in October 2008.\nAs a roleplaying adventure, the fate of Dar is determined by the actions of those involved in the game, making it possible for him to either fall to the dark side or join them as a Jedi once again. If Dar decides to remain a Jedi, he will aid the Republic agents in the fight with the Sith commandos and encourage them to capture a nearby ship. If, however, Dar falls to the dark side, he will defend himself against the agents and retreat to the ship himself. Providing that Dar survives the encounter, he would likely be in no shape to help either the Republic agents or the Sith, but he will aid his chosen allies if possible.",
