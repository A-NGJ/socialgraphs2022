 "content": "Ardmore was a Human male who served as a captain in the Imperial Army of the reconstituted Sith Empire on the planet Balmorra during the Cold War. Captain Ardmore tasked one of his subordinates, Lieutenant Torsin, with leading a squad to reclaim the Stillwater Farms in the Gorinth Agricultural Sector, and the unit carried a set of RK-9 soil devastators as a last resort. When Torsin's unit was killed by the Balmorran resistance, Ardmore had his subordinate Lieutenant Nalto continue to try and contact Torsin, and when Imperial forces came upon their bodies, Armdore asked them to destroy the farms with the soil devastators.\nArdmore appears in hologram form in conversations for the mission \"Salting the Fields\" for Imperial players in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
