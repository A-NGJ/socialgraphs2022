 "content": "Sander was a Moff on the Council of Moffs in 19 ABY. He was a realist, acknowledging both that some systems in his sector would leave the Empire if given the choice and that Pellaeon was right about the need to negotiate peace while they could. He was a Humanocentrist and had an obsessive fear of being captured by the New Republic.",
