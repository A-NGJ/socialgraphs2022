 "content": "Tubrimi was a male Mon Calamari lieutenant in the New Republic Defense Fleet. In 5.5 ABY, he served as a pilot aboard the cruiser Justice during the Battle of Mindor.\nAs Skywalker's fleet was approaching the planet Mindor, Tubrimi was stationed onboard the cruiser Justice. When Shadowspawn was willing to make a truce, Skywalker eventually consulted with his officers and came to the conclusion that Tubrimi should notify the ship. This, however, did not go well when the Justice was split apart. Kalback was killed, and Tubrimi suffered a minor injury from his shoulder and ordered the evacuation along with Skywalker. When Skywalker decided to move the remains of the ship to the surface of the planet, Tubrimi expressed concerns, but eventually agreed to his will.",
