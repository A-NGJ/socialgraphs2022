 "content": "Kn'ik Th'ronik was a Fnessian of that species' third gender, thos, who worked as a gunrunner and a droid smuggler. Kn'ik used its connections in this way to help supply the Rebel Alliance with material. It was wanted by the SoroSuub Corporation for the theft of their freighter, the Morgannier. Th'ronik was said to have an aversion to violence, and instead of battling the bounty hunters sent to capture it, Kn'ik chose to use deception and trickery to evade its pursuers.",
