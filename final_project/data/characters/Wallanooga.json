 "content": "Wallanooga the Hutt, also known as both Walla and Nooga, was one of the most powerful arms dealers in the Outer Rim until his death. He and his partner, Dreddon, based their operations on Tatooine and did their dealing with all sorts of people, from bounty hunters to Jabba Desilijic Tiure.\nAside from his arms-dealing enterprises, Wallanooga had extensive business interests in the Outer Rim slave trade, He was also the Hutt to see for those looking to hire top-quality assassins. He favored and most enjoyed working with the Anzati, finding their innate cruelty admirable and almost Hutt-like.\nThe Sennex pirates sold Aurra Sing to Wallanooga, who had hopes of turning the girl into his own Force-sensitive assassin. He apprenticed her to the Anzati not long after he bought her. Wallanooga was killed by Aurra Sing sometime before 36 BBY when he failed to meet a deal with her.",
