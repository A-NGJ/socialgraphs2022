 "content": "Bonne was a male Human who served as a private in the Republic Army during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. During the war, he was stationed on the planet Quesh, where he set up an equipment stall inside a Republic Supply Center built within the Republic Operational Headquarters. Bonne wore a green uniform and a breath mask while in Quesh's toxic atmosphere, and carried a blaster pistol. He had fair skin, blue eyes and brown hair.\nBonne appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as an Equipment Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Quesh. His location was also marked in The Old Republic's accompanying Prima Games strategy guide, Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide. Bonne was later relabeled as Private Bonne and used as a Level 34 Modifications Vendor, and with the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, he now appears on a number of planets and Carrick Station.",
