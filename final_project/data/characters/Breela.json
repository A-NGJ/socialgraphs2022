 "content": "Breela was a female Farghul bounty hunter, and leader of Crimson Nova, a chapter of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. She was the daughter of Mika, a bounty hunter who worked during the Clone Wars and hated Jedi. She was tattooed on her face and abdomen; the lines around her navel were similar to those of a Zealot of Psusan.\nIn 0 BBY, Breela, together with fellow hunters Boushh and Zuckuss, tracked down Jedi Master Kai Justiss a survivor of Order 66. Justiss had sought refuge on the planet of Garqi, but was betrayed by local farmers to Breela and the others. After a skirmish, during which Justiss defeated at least two other combatants and severed the arm of one of them, Breela, Boushh and Zuckuss surrounded him and held him at blaster point.\nThe name \"Breela\" first appeared in Ultimate Alien Anthology as an example of a typical Farghul name.\nThe writer of Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy, Ryan Kaufman, originally named her Mika'a, intending it to show that Farghul children were named after their parents with an extra vowel added to denote ancestry. However, it was changed before the final draft.",
