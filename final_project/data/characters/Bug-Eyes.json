 "content": "Bug-Eyes was a male pilot belonging to the sentient species native to the planet Xantar. He met Luke Skywalker after the Rebel Alliance officer destroyed an Imperial cloning facility. The pilot brought Skywalker to Xantar aboard his starship. There, he introduced the young Rebel to Indiana Jones, whose planet the pilot had visited some time earlier.\nThis character is meant to resemble the common image of aliens believed to visit Earth, known as Greys. He originally appeared at the end of the Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures video game, taking Indy away in his flying saucer. He and Indiana Jones later appeared in Yoda Stories as a reference to that earlier game.",
