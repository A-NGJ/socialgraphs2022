 "content": "The Lesser Sarlacc of Dathomir, also known as the Dathomir Sarlacc, was a sarlacc pit located in the Asou Dankal region of the planet Dathomir by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Its origins were unknown, though it was considered almost as frightening as its larger relative in the Great Pit of Carkoon on Tatooine. Little was understood on the ways sarlaccs grew or lived due to the great dangers involved in studying them, which was why it was advised a doctor be present whenever someone visited this site.\nThe Dathomir Sarlacc was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
