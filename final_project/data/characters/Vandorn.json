 "content": "Vandorn was a Human male who served in the rank as Captain of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War on Belsavis. Like most members of the Empire, he discriminated against other species, especially the Trandoshans and their beliefs and he sought to take advantage of them by tasking strong fighters to defeat a leader of Trandoshan prisoners on the planet and use them as slaves. After the Trandoshans were defeated, the fighters either enslaved and collared the Trandoshan prisoners or they demanded that Vandorn show the Trandoshans respect.",
