 "content": "Niebur Boton was a female Zeltron Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic.\nNiebur Boton was a Force-sensitive female Zeltron trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. After some time, Boton completed her Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, Boton fought as a General within the Grand Army of the Republic. In 19 BBY, as the war came to an end, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Contingency Order 66 to the Army's clone troopers, a command ordering them to kill their Jedi leaders. Boton survived at first, but was eventually found by the newly risen Galactic Empire. Tortured by Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne, Boton succumbed to the intense interrogation and revealed the names of several of her surviving comrades. Boton died soon after and her body was transported to Coruscant by several Imperial stormtroopers. Meeting the body at its landing site, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader took up the fallen Jedi's lightsaber and mutilated her body with it.",
