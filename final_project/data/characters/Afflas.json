 "content": "Afflas was a female Zeltron con artist who operated on the moon of Nar Shaddaa in the time of the Galactic Empire and teamed up with Lentsch and Loonoo to run a scam.\nWhile on the moon of Nar Shaddaa, Afflas worked with Lentsch and Loonoo to operate a spice den scam at Lentsch's spice den in Megablock 65. As part of the scam, Afflas used her charms to convince an offworlder to join her at the spice den and order an off-menu sampler, after which Lentsch would deliver a bill far higher than what the victim was expecting with threats of violence if they didn't pay. Afflas and Lentsch's operation was so successful that the two decided they did not need Loonoo's help in running it, despite the fact that the original idea for the scam was Loonoo's. After Afflas and Lentsch shut him out of the scheme, Loonoo recorded the experience in Maz Kanata's Smuggler's Guide.\nAfflas was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide, written by Daniel Wallace.",
