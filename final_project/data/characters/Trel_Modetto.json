 "content": "Trel Modetto was an outlaw tech/smuggler native to the Tapani sector. He spent many years traveling around the Outer Rim Territories with the Void Demons pirate gang. He later deserted the gang and stole a small freighter named the Eternal Hope and made his way back to the Tapani Sector, on the way selling his services as a smuggler, outlaw tech, freelance gunman, and scout. When he left the services of the pirate gang, he stole the location of a secret pirate shadowport, that the Void Demons were naturally keen to seek retribution for. He became wanted by House Mecetti when he tried to sell the location of the shadowport but managed to ruin the deal in some way. The Imperial authorities and numerous illegal moneylenders also wanted to locate Trel.",
