 "content": "Phirk was a male Quara Aqualish and a swoop pilot for the Hidden Beks on Taris during 3956 BBY.\nPhirk's track record was easily beaten by Revan, who raced with a prototype accelerator that gave him an advantage over veteran swoop racers. He was present when Revan was declared victor of the competition and witnessed how he was betrayed. Like the other unarmed and particularly helpless racers, he fled the scene.",
