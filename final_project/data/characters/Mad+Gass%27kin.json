 "content": "Mad Gass'kin was a Bothan male who owned and operated Mad Gass'kin's Used DroidNet. He ran an advertisement for his services on the DroidNet.\nIn his advertisement, he claimed that his agents would procure whatever droids the buyer would want, and deliver to the client, so to protect Gass'kin.\nHe also claimed that he was not \"Mad\", but that it was his actual name that happened to mean a certain way in Galactic Basic Standard.\nMad Gass'kin's advertisement appears in the Look Sir, Droids! article in 2001's Star Wars Gamer 3.",
