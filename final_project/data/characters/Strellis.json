 "content": "Strellis was a female Twi'lek Jedi who served on the planet Corellia. During the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Republic she ran a stall within the Republic controlled Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport. Strellis had no hair, brown eyes and yellow skin. While at her stall she wore white armor marked with the Republic's emblem, brown robes, a golden headband and spoke in a language other than basic to her customers.\nStrellis appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Equipment Commendations Vendor for Republic players on Corellia. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, Strellis was removed from the game along with the rest of the Equipment Commendations Vendors. Her position is also marked on a map in Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, a game guide released by Prima Games.",
