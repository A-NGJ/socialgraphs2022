 "content": "Kylbar was a male Mon Calamari, who served as an aide to Admiral Ackbar during the Galactic Civil War.\nKylbar served as aide to Admiral Ackbar, aboard the cruiser Home One. In 3 ABY, a group of Alliance agents transported the child Caeleb to Home One and were debriefed by Kylbar, on the behalf of Ackbar. Kylbar then took custody of the child and told the agents that Mon Mothma, the leader of the Alliance, had arranged for Caeleb to be transported to a safe place.\nFour months later, the Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra traveled to the place where Kylbar and Caeleb were staying. Rystra used a mind trick to make Kylbar think that he was Luke Skywalker, then kidnapped the child. Caeleb was eventually rescued and returned to the Rebel fleet, where Kylbar again received custody of the boy.",
