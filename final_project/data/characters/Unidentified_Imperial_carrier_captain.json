 "content": "A Imperial carrier captain served on the Liberator during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. While serving as a carrier captain for the ship, a mission was sent out by Jun Sato to capture the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier to use for docking more rebel pilots for the rebellion. During the mission, an Imperial officer notifies the captain that they have lost contact with the containment squad. The captain they remarks that he wants a full detachment sent to the adjacent hangar. This, however, didn't last long, when rebels Hera Syndulla, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger barged into the bridge.\nThe Imperial captain tried to shoot Kanan Jarrus, but was deflected by a lightsaber. He then informed the rebels that reinforcements were on their way, only for Hera to thank him for the notification. Kanan then let Ezra use a mind trick on the officer to tell the crew of the Liberator to abandon ship. Ezra then told the captain to also abandon ship with the rest of the crew.\nThe Imperial carrier captain appeared in \"Homecoming\", an episode in the second season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels. He was voiced by Corey Burton.",
