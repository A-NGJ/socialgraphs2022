 "content": "Durant was a male Human General who served the Galactic Republic during the Galactic War against the Sith Empire.\nSomewhere between 3665 and 3653 BBY, Durant fought alongside Sergeant Fideltin Rusk during the Geonosis campaign after he became a general in the Republic High Command.\nDuring the Invasion of Taris in 3642 BBY, Durant was part of the War Trust in their efforts to defeat the Sith. Together, the War Trust devised a new technology called Siantide, believing that it would outclass anything the Imperials could come up with. He was later targeted by the Empire, along with the rest of the War Trust, by Darth Baras' Plan Zero. Generals Minst and Frelka were the first to be hunted down and killed by Darth Baras' apprentice, a cunning and powerful Sith Warrior. When the Warrior infiltrated Durant's base, the General flaunted his prototype blaster powered by Siantide technology. Deciding it was time for a demonstration, Durant ordered his men to attack. However, they underestimated the Sith, who slaughtered them all. Mortally wounded, Durant promised that the Warrior would not defeat General Faraire. The Warrior mocked him, saying that he had died for nothing and promised to destroy everything he had built. Durant then expired.",
