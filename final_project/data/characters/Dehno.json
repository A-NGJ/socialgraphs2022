 "content": "Dehno was a Human male patrol captain who worked for the Czerka Corporation branch on Kashyyyk.\nDehno was a ruthless man, who would kill  any Wookiee slaves that became rebellious.\nHe eventually encountered Revan who persuaded him not to enslave any more Wookiees and to request a transfer.\nIf the player fails to persuade otherwise then the player may have to kill him. They will still get light side points, but not as much.\nIf the player entices Zaalbar to attack them, then he may earn dark side points.",
