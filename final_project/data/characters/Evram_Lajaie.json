 "content": "Evram Lajaie was a Human male commander of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 0 BBY, he was at the Alliance's base on Yavin 4. When General Jan Dodonna, the base's commander, received the secret plans for the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon, Lajaie's expertise in both space defense and orbital battlestations enabled him to quickly uncover a fatal flaw in the design of the Death Star. Lajaie then attended a meeting where Dodonna discussed those findings with the base's starfighter squadrons, and the General organized an attack on the Imperial superweapon. During the subsequent space battle, Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker successfully destroyed the Death Star, and Lajaie was present in a ceremony honoring Skywalker and other heroes of the battle.\nThe Human male Evram Lajaie served as a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 0 BBY, he was present in the Great Temple, the Alliance's base on the moon Yavin 4. That year, the base's commander, General Jan Dodonna, received the secret plans for the Galactic Empire's superweapon, the first Death Star battlestation. Dodonna, along with Lajaie and others, frantically searched for possibilities to destroy the station, and Lajaie's expertise in space defense and orbital battlestations enabled him to quickly analyze the Death Star plans. After careful analysis, Lajaie discovered a fatal flaw in the Death Star's designâ€”a weakness in its thermal exhaust port vulnerable to proton torpedo assault.\nLajaie was present in a briefing where Dodonna both discussed the findings and arranged for the base's starfighter squadrons to launch an attack on the Death Star. During the battle that followed, Lajaie was present alongside Dodonna in the base's command center monitoring the space battle. Eventually, the battle was won when Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star by firing proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the whole Death Star. Following the battle, Lajaie was present in a ceremony when the Medal of Bravery was awarded to Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca.\nEvram Lajaie was a popular Alliance leader. Because of his special expertise of space defense and orbital battlestations, Lajaie quickly made the discovery that allowed Luke Skywalker to destroy the Death Star. Lajaie had gray hair and fair skin.\nEvram Lajaie first appeared as an uncredited Rebel extra in the Yavin 4 scenes of the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, including the ending ceremony honoring the Heroes of Yavin. The character was first identified by name, and given a brief back-story, in the 1996 A New Hope Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.",
