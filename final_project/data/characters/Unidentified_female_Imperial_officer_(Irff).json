 "content": "A human female Imperial officer served the Galactic Empire. At some point, she took a vacation to the planet Irff.\nThere she met the Rebel pilots Biggs Darklighter and Jek Tono Porkins, who confronted her. She claimed that she was only impersonating an officer; however when the Rebels left, she called security. When she returned to work, she was confronted with inane problems.\nShe had six children named Brit, Blip, Flip, Jeef, Gerf, and Bilf, and an adopted child named Arnold.\nThe officer appears in \"Stolen Valor\", published in 2019 in the Marvel Comics issue Age of Rebellion Special 1.",
