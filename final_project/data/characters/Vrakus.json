 "content": "Vrakus was the name of a nexu living on Voss during the Cold War. It was killed around 3640 BBY.\nVrakus appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on the planet Voss. He is not directly involved in any quests, however he can be killed by characters of both factions for loot and as part of an achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
