 "content": "Vilardo Kaine was a moderately successful trader and unapologetic speciesist living on Sartinaynian. He was the father of the Moff Ardus Kaine. Foisting all his aspirations on his son, he insisted it was his boy's duty to reach the highest echelon of galactic power. He was killed in a pirate attack that had pushed his son to wholeheartedly support Naboo Senator Palpatine's philosophy.",
