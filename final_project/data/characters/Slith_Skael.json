 "content": "Slith Skael was a Sluissi male from Sluis Van, who served as a chief communications technician of the Intergalactic Communications Center and assistant to Reija Momen. He was devoted to his superiors, but when the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded the planet, he along with Rejia and the defenders were killed.\nThe novel Jedi Trial incorrectly portrays the Sluissi as allies of the Republic, when in reality they were Separatists. One of the most notable foul-ups in this case was placing Slith Skael as one of the heroic hostages of Pors Tonith, as well as mentioning several times that it was possible that they would receive reinforcements from Sluis Van.",
