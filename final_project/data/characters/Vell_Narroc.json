 "content": "Vell Narroc was a male Anomid who served the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the resurgent Sith Empire. He worked as a recruiter for the Republic's Power Guard Project at the project's recruitment center on Nar Shaddaa, and was captured by Imperials when Lord Nefarid seized control of the project. He and his fellow recruiters were freed when an unknown Jedi Knight arrived and defeated the Imperial shocktroopers. Upon learning that the Jedi was searching for Agent Galen, Narroc directed the Knight to the project's lab in the Red Light Sector.\nVell Narroc was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. He appears in the Jedi Knight storyline on Nar Shaddaa, as part of the mission \"The Search for Agent Galen\".",
