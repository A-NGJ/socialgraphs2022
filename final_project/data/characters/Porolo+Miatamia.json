 "content": "Porolo Miatamia was a male Diamal senator of the New Republic who represented the Diamala people by 19 ABY and was one of the largest supporters of peace during the Caamas Document Crisis.\nPorolo Miatamia was the elected senator for the Diamala during the crisis and a political rival of Senator Ghic Dx'ono of the Ishori. During the crisis, Miatamia and his aide along with Lando Calrissian, who was transporting them from Cilpar to Coruscant, was captured by the impostor Flim posing as Grand Admiral Thrawn. While these were deemed as false by Dx'ono and the rest of the senate while in session, these were proven to be true.\nBy 25 ABY, he was a member of the Council on Security and Intelligence. Thus, he was at the presentation by Colonel Belindi Kalenda concerning the \"defection\" of Elan and Vergere and the attack on Wayland by the Yuuzhan Vong.\nHe was an accomplished sabacc player.",
