 "content": "Etsero was an Adnerem gangster who ran the largest gambling house on the planet Adner, The Red Lisken. Although successful at first, Etsero soon found himself in debt to several people, including Jabba the Hutt. To raise the money needed to pay his creditors, Etsero began regularly cheating his customers. After the death of Jabba and the imprisonment of several creditors, Etsero believed his problems were over until he found out that the debts had been transferred to a third party with Imperial sympathies. The Red Lisken was soon laundering credits for the Empire.\nHe was a known associate of Theol Dunoche.",
