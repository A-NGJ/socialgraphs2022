 "content": "An individual who was a male Neimoidian served as the captain of a Lucrehulk-class Battleship as part of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During an attack on his battleship, the Neimoidian ordered his Vulture droid starfighters to do something to stop the attack, such as putting more taxes on the attacker's ship. The Separatist was killed during the attack, stating that his superior would hear about his failure before the battleship exploded. He had gray skin and black eyes.\nThe Neimoidian appeared in the 2022 video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga developed by Traveller's Tales. In the game, the captain is encountered after the player has seized another Lucrehulk-class Battleship-. The captain and his ship could be present in the planets of Mustafar, Geonosis, Naboo, Kamino, Kashyyyk, Coruscant, and Utapau. After his defeat—although he was dead—he could continue to create battleship raids in the same planets.",
