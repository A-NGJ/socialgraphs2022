 "content": "A Klatooinian male was a member of a band of pariahs who lived in a settlement on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V during the final year of the Clone Wars. The Klatooinian worked closely with the settlement's leader, Gaan, and held some leadership roles. When a Republic LAAT/i gunship arrived on Ragmar V in order to establish a Republic outpost, the Klatooinian fired a missile launcher at the gunship, destroying it. However, the occupants, a Jedi Padawan named Joc Sah and his clone trooper detachment, survived and began to make their way to the settlement.\nThe pariahs gathered to make a stand against the Republic for their own reasons, but when Sah and his clone troopers arrived, the clones received the command to execute Order 66—a directive that labeled all Jedi as traitors to the Republic. In order to avoid being killed by his own men, Sah made peace with Gaan as they took cover from the clone troopers' weapons. The Klatooinian ordered the settlers to open fire on the clones, and the pariahs quickly won the short skirmish. The settlement began to make preparations to fight a second wave of clone troopers who arrived a short time later.\nA Klatooinian male lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. At some point he joined a settlement of pariahs on the Outer Rim planet Ragmar V. He was still there by 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars—an intergalactic conflict that had begun during the year 22 BBY. It was during that final year of the war when Republic armies arrived on Ragmar V in hopes of building an outpost, which they planned to use as a staging ground for an upcoming attack on the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nThe Ragmar V settlement's leader, a Human named Gaan, detested the Republic's presence for his own reasons, and ordered the Klatooinian to fire a missile launcher at a Republic Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship that had landed on a nearby mesa. Although the Klatooinian's projectile destroyed the gunship, the occupants—a Jedi Padawan named Joc Sah and his clone trooper detachment—survived. As Sah and his troopers began to make their way to the settlement, the Klatooinian and another member of his species rounded up a number of the settlers in a cantina, where Gaan began to lay out a plan of attack to repel the Republic forces.\nGaan ordered everybody to the rooftops while he would confront the Republic forces in the streets. The Human made a special note that he wanted to kill the Jedi himself.\nAs the settlers made their ways to the rooftops, the Klatooinian took a Rodian, a Bith, and a Human female to the roof of a building that directly overlooked Gaan's position in the street, and from there they waited for Gaan's signal to fire. Gaan met the Republic forces in the street and briefly exchanged words with Sah. However, Sah's clone trooper sergeant, Remy, received Order 66 just then from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine; Order 66 labeled all Jedi as traitors of the Republic, and they were to be executed on sight without hesitation. Remy followed the command and ordered his men to open fire on Sah, forcing the Jedi to take cover inside a building.\nGaan, however, thought that his men had opened fire from the rooftops without the signal, but the Klatooinian, still on a roof himself, was quick to point out that the blaster fire had originated from the clones. Gaan, who still wanted to kill the Jedi, angrily killed a clone trooper, which caused the rest of the troopers to attack him. As Gaan took cover with Sah, the Klatooinian gave his own order to fire in retaliation for the attack on Gaan. The fight was brief, and Gaan killed Remy during the skirmish. Sah, realizing he was now alone, agreed to band with the outcasts and face another detachment of clone troopers that would be arriving to ensure Sah's elimination. The Klatooinian and the others battled the clones upon their arrival.\nAt some point, Gaan and Sah both escaped into the deserts of Ragmar V, and from there, they performed a number of hit-and-run attacks against the clone troopers.\nThe Klatooinian was not sympathetic to the Republic, and followed Gaan's order to destroy a Republic gunship on sight. He worked closely with Gaan and held some leadership roles, relaying orders from Gaan and giving his own orders when the Human was unavailable.\nWhile Klatooinians generally had five-fingered hands like most Humans and Human subspecies, this one and his Klatooinian partner both had hands with two fingers and a thumb. The Klatooinian had brown-colored skin and black eyes.\nThe Klatooinian was known to make use of several weapons during the confrontation with Sergeant Remy's men. These weapons included a large missile launcher that he used—with his final missile—to destroy a Republic gunship, and a large blaster rifle with a scope. The Klatooinian also made use of two DL-44 heavy blaster pistols that he wielded simultaneously against Remy and his men.\nThe Klatooinian wore a belt full of pouches and a bandolier, along with shoulder pads.\nThe Klatooinian was created for the short story The Order of Outcasts, which was one of four stories compiled into the fifth volume of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures trade paperback series that was released on April 12, 2006. The Order of Outcasts was written by Matt Jacobs, and was illustrated by Matthew and Shawn Fillbach. Despite having a speaking role, the character was not given a name.\nThe two Klatooinian characters who appeared in the story both seem to have been drawn based on the Klatooinians with three digits on their hands who appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, as opposed to the Klatooinians in the original Star Wars films, who all had five digits on their hands.",
