 "content": "Sawthawne was a Lutrillian gangster who operated out of Bespin. He was the unofficial \"boss of port town\" on Cloud City. He was also controlling a deserted part of Tibannopolis. Sawthawne had the odd habit of wearing antique optical spectacles. Despite his bookish appearance and feeble physique, he was a brilliant organizer who surrounded himself with a cadre of trained killers. Sawthawne had his fingers in smuggling, slavery, and protection rackets, and scoundrels came from all over the Anoat sector to land jobs with Sawthawne. He was the owner of the SoroSuub Personal Luxury Yacht 3000 Best Chance.",
