 "content": "Johnair was a male Dowutin who lived on the planet Corellia during the Imperial Era. He raced Han Solo in speeders in order win 10,000 credits. Early in the race, Johnair's speeder was damaged by Moloch's speeder, forcing Johnair to finish the race on foot.\nCreators Bill Motz and Bob Roth named Johnair after podcasters Aaron Goins and Johnamarie Macias. The pair host Star Scavengers, a Lego Star Wars podcast that primarily reviewed the canon adjacent Lego Star Wars tv show, The Freemaker Adventures.\nWhilst it is unknown whether Johnair will ever return to screens, Aaron Goins has speculated on Twitter, positing his belief that Johnair was perhaps trying to finance a rebel cell or earn a living for his family. Bob Roth  commented that the characters 'waters run deep' and that there were 'Many stories to tell'.",
