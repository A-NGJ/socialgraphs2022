 "content": "Escara Frei was a Human female who lived on the desert world Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Escara Frei resided in Mos Eisley. The woman was an Imperial sympathizer and was a friend of Imperial Captain Jasha in Bestine.\nIn 1 ABY, Frei and a man named Jorund Redd was caught in a firefight between Lady Valarian's guards and Jabba the Hutt's thugs in Mos Eisley. The old woman was hit by one or more shots, but her injuries weren't severe. A medic, sent by the 2-1B droid Billingsly to help Administrator Nillika and the local medical staff, treated her wounds. Frei suggested that the medic may contact Captain Jasha to work for the Empire.\nLater the same year, she visited the mayor of Mos Eisley Mikdanyell Guh'rantt to complain about noise caused by unscrupulous merchants.\nEscara Frei was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Escara Frei was added to the game upon the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.\nEscara Frei could be found near the starport and medical center in Mos Eisley. She was part of the low-level quest \"Caught in the Crossfire\" for players of the Medic profession. The player was contacted by Billingsly and needed to talk to Frei to treat her wounds.",
