 "content": "Toedri was a male Quarren prefect who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, he was in some way involved with the Azure Cabal.\nToedri appears in the directory tree files for the 2003 massively multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. According to these files, Toedri would have been in some way involved with the Azure Cabal questline. However, Toedri is not known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game.",
