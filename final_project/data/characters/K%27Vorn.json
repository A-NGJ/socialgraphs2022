 "content": "K'Vorn was a Human merchant who lived on the planet Taris during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. A brown haired Human male with brown eyes, he was one of many of his species who settled on Taris. A fluent speaker of Basic, K'Vorn wore medium armor for protection from the world's wildlife. He sold medium armor from his shop in Olaris, the headquarters of the Republic-sponsored Taris Resettlement Initiative.\nK'Vorn appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Medium Armor Vendor for Republic players on Taris. With the release of Game Update 4.0 on October 20, 2015, K'Vorn was removed from the game along with the rest of the Medium Armor Vendors.",
