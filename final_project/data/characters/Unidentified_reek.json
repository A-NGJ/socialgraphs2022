 "content": "While at the Petranaki arena, this reek was used as the means to execute Jedi Anakin Skywalker.\nWhen Anakin Skywalker, Padm√© Amidala, and Obi-Wan Kenobi were captured by Count Dooku on Geonosis, this reek was selected along with an acklay and a nexu to be the animals used to execute the three. Because of it being deprived of its herbivorous diet, it was extremely aggressive. The three manage to escape from their chains and fight back against the creatures, Skywalker being able to tame the reek and use it to kill the Nexu and rescue both Amidala and Kenobi.\nWhen the Geonosis strike team arrived and helped the three prisoners, the reek bucked its three riders off and went around the arena. During the fight, he charged at Mace Windu who cut one of his horns. When Jango Fett landed in the arena to help fight, the reek ran over him, damaging his jetpack. When the reek turned around for another charge, Jango shot it. The reek died seconds later.",
