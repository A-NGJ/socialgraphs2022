 "content": "Phinea Shantee was a patron of the Bestine cantina.\nIn 1 ABY, Shantee was accused of cheating in a Sabacc game. A local thug was on his way to break her legs, but an unknown spacer intervened to help. The spacer killed the thug, named Chalurrekk, and returned to Phinea. Thankful, Phinea gave the spacer a few credits and a six-sided die.\nHowever, Phinea's problems were not yet over. She wanted the Trandoshan crime boss killed, so that she could live in peace. The spacer succeeded in killing the Trandoshan, and was awarded with a bottle of wine for his work.\nPhinea Shantee was a Non-Player Character  in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. She would give a short series of quests which offered small rewards. She was removed from the game, however, for reasons unknown.",
