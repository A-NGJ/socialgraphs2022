 "content": "Tammia Hollusen's mother was a worker in shift 114E on the Imperial factory world of Metalorn. Her daughter was supposed to be in the learning center while she was on shift, but Tammi would sneak out to try to grow plants in the nutrient-starved soil, a practice her mother tried to dissuade her from. Tammia Hollusen's mother wanted to spend time with her daughter, but the strict regimentation of Metalorn, overseen by Imperial Stormtroopers, made that difficult.",
