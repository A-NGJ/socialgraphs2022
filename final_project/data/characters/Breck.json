 "content": "Breck was a male Human who served the Black Sun criminal organization during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Breck was the captain of the Black Sun starship Raptor, and in about 18 BBY, the vessel docked on the planet Mandalore in preparation to deliver a cargo of illicit goods to Kantaros Station, an Imperial-controlled installation in the Both system. As part of an arrangement that the Jedi Knight had with Black Sun, Breck was also assigned to ferry the Jedi Jax Pavan to the station. However, just as he was preparing the Raptor for take-off, Breck received a communication from the Falleen Black Sun vigo Xizor that ordered the crew of the Raptor to stand down, because Xizor did not want the Empire to suspect that Black Sun had been aiding the Jedi. Breck informed Pavan of Xizor's decision, and the Jedi stormed off the vessel to confront Xizor.",
