 "content": "Wally was a small, green-colored male frog kept as a pet by one of the residents of the first Death Star superweapon. At some point during the construction of the space station, Wally went missing aboard the Death Star, prompting his owner to offer through the HoloNet feed one hundred credits if anyone found and returned the frog to his caretaker.\nWally was mentioned in the non-canon mobile game Star Wars: Tiny Death Star, which was developed by Disney Mobile in collaboration with LucasArts and NimbleBit and released in 2013. In the game, a HoloNet feed message from a randomly generated character known as a \"bitizen\" will occasionally appear, stating that the owner lost their frog and intends to reward the individual who finds it; however, this is not an actual quest the player can undertake.",
