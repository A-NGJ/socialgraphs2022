 "content": "Melicoste was a Human male Sith Lord who served as a loyal agent to Darth Baras during the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nMelicoste was a Human male Sith Lord of the Sith Empire. Around 3641 BBY, he was sent by Darth Baras to free his sister Darth Ekkage from the Belsavis prison, belonging to the Galactic Republic. Melicoste commandeered a squad of Imperial commandos led by Lieutenant Kaid and set out to track Ekkage's location. After pinning Ekkage's location, he sent a detachment of men to free Ekkage's imprisoned Sith assassins, but they were stopped by the Emperor's Wrath. Meanwhile, Melicoste made it to Cell Block 77-Z within The Tomb, where Ekkage was being kept. He proceeded to free her but instead of showing gratitude, Ekkage effortlessly killed Melicoste for his incompetence.\nThe player has the option of letting him leave for light side points or letting Ekkage kill him for dark side points.",
