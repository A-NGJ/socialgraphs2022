 "content": "Ballard was a male Human who lived during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He served in the Republic Army as a lieutenant and was stationed on the planet of Coruscant. On Coruscant, he worked out of the Equipment Requisitions area of the Senate Commercial District where he trained Republic troopers.\nBallard first appeared in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a class trainer for the trooper class. He is only accessible to Republic players in the game as he is found on Coruscant which is a Republic-only planet.",
