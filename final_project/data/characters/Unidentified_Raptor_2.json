 "content": "This Raptor served under Warlord Zsinj and was deployed with his partner on the planet Halmad shortly after the battle that took place. He participated in the search for Wraith Squadron pilot Ton Phanan when his TIE Fighter crashed on the planet. His partner questioned the stormtrooper guarding the crash site for more information; and deeming the information inadequate, they mounted their speeder bikes to conduct a search of their own. Just as they were about leave, they were shot to death by Garik Loran; another Wraith who was also searching for Phanan.",
