 "content": "Raena was a female Human Lieutenant of the Coruscant Security Force during the war against Zakuul. Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, she joined CSF Commander Kallin, an outspoken critic of the Alliance, in organizing a false-flag operation. The rogue CSF officers planned to bomb the Senate Tower and make it look like the Alliance was responsible. However, the Eternal Alliance learned of Kallin's plan and moved to intercept him and his followers. The Alliance operatives tracked them to their base in the Works, where they engaged and defeated Raena before killing Kallin himself.\nLieutenant Raena appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as a boss in the \"Divided We Fall\" Uprising.",
