 "content": "Bela Elar was a Twi'lek female pilot with the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the war against the Galactic Empire, and flew with Red Squadron.\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bela Elar flew with Red Squadron under the callsign Red Four, and fought in a battle in the Kiax Nebula some time after the Battle of Yavin.\nShortly after the evacuation of Hoth in 3 ABY, Elar was flying a T-65B X-wing starfighter when her alluvial dampers were blown out and had to go extravehicular to fix them in deep space. Commander Wedge Antilles and Wes Janson recruited Elar back into the newly reformed Red Squadron and given the responsibilities of her own flight. She flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as flight leader in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point. Her wingmen during the attack were Grizz Frix and Penn Zowlie, and her flight's job was to run interference, covering Janson's flight, who would hit targets on the landing field. Zowlie was killed during the battle, but the new squadron succeeded in eliminating the pirates.\nElar was a respected pilot and was one of the first picks for the new Red Squadron. After Antilles recounted the story of her fixing her alluvial dampers in deep space, Janson was impressed and regarded her as a top pilot as well as their squadron's engineering department.",
