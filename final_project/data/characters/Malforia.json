 "content": "Malforia was a female Human Exarch of Zakuul who commanded the Star Fortress above the planet Balmorra. However, she was captured by the spymaster known as The Shroud after the destruction of her Fortress. She was held captive and studied for her fanatic personality at the Shroud's Wild Space base, the Coil. Later on, she was discovered by HK-55 and his companion Z0-0M, the former who also had been held captive. Both HK-55 and Malforia were then taken by surprise when Zeeyo revealed herself to be a replicator droid, as she took on both HK and Malforia's appearances. Malforia then demanded to be released, desiring something to kill, and reasoned that they have a common foe.\nMalforia was an individual known for her fanaticism, even among the Exarchs of Zakuul. She strictly followed the Old Ways of Zakuul and adopted the the symbol of Tyth, the god of rage, as her own personal sigil. Her philosophies guided her governance style. On her Star Fortress, she massacred more than thirty Balmorran officials in Tyth's name, earning her great infamy.\nExarch Malforia only appeared in the Bonus Chapter, \"Shroud of Memory\" releases after the end of the Digital Expansion Knights of the Fallen Empire for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.\nThe player, playing as HK-55, can decide Malforia's fate two ways:",
