 "content": "Yorick was a Human male slicer who lived on Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, a ship carrying medical equipment for the merchant Sinis, one of Yorick's friend, apparently crashed near Tyrena. Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve some equipment. The spacer fought several Deflarian scavengers around the wreck and recovered the flight recorder from the Deflarians. Sinis then requested Yorick to analyze the flight recorder and the slicer discovered that it was modified by the Deflarians. This eventually led to the discovery that the Deflarians hijacked the ship to stole its cargo and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft.\nYorick was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Yorick was added to the game with the release of the \"Publish 28\", on April 26, 2006.",
