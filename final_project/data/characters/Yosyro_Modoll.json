 "content": "Yosyro Modoll was a Zeltron female who worked as an artist during the Clone Wars and was famed for the sensual illustrations she produced for semi-proscribed holo-periodicals. In order to avoid an obscenity charge, Modoll agreed to a plea bargain that required her to work for the Galactic Republic. As a result, she produced the propaganda poster Keep Our Republic Secure which included a borderline ribald depiction of a personal assistant droid and reminded citizens to perform regular memory wipes on their own droids to prevent secrets leaking to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nYosyro Modoll was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.",
