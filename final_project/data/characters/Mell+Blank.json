 "content": "Mell Blank was a Sullustan male impersonator and extortionist who was active during the Clone Wars.\nFor fraud and usury, he was captured by the Galactic Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on M'Bardi and would be shipped to Coruscant. While being guarded by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, the cruiser was attacked by Separatists under the command of General Grievous. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the Jedi. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Blank was one of the first who agreed to help the Jedi in repairing the ship. Moving safely through Republic space, Skywalker thanked Blank and the prisoners for helping and guaranteed that their aid will affect their parole.",
