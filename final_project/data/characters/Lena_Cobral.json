 "content": "Lena Cobral was a young woman who testified against her family so that she could overthrow their web of corruption on the planet of Frego. Her testimony was sparked by the murder of her husband, Rutin Cobral, at the hands of Solan Cobral, Zanita Cobral, and the rest of the family.\nLena summoned the Jedi Council for escort on her journey to testify in front of the Galactic Senate. The Council dispatched Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, who assisted Lena in gathering the evidence she needed. However, a sudden betrayal by her mother-in-law, Zanita, nearly cost Lena her life. The attack was thwarted by Obi-Wan, who had grown infatuated with Lena since the start of the mission.\nLena's fate after testifying is unknown, though she did become a celebrated hero of Frego. Obi-Wan speculated that she would become a politician, but Lena insisted that she would travel away from Frego and live the rest of her life on a distant world.",
