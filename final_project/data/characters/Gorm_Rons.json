 "content": "Gorm Rons was a male Human who was a commander of House Ulgo's troops during the Cold War. He patrolled the Ulgo Footpaths around and near King's Pass on Alderaan, and was eventually killed by a Republic individual in 3643 BBY.\nGorm Rons appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic on Alderaan. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
