 "content": "Apted Squelsh was a female Mon Calamari major in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. In 21 BBY, she oversaw clone troopers at a training camp on the moon Vandor-3, under Admiral Arikakon Baraka. During that time, she briefed Captain CT-96/298 on his mission to the planet Ord Cestus.\nApted Squelsh was a female Mon Calamari who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. During the Clone Wars, Squelsh served in the Grand Army of the Republic and held the rank of major. In 21 BBY, Squelsh oversaw the actions of clone troopers at the training camp on Vandor-3, a moon of the Republic's capital planet Coruscant.\nDuring her time at Vandor-3, Squelsh ordered Advanced Recon Commando Captain CT-96/298, nicknamed \"Nate,\" to visit her at her office for an administrative review. When Nate arrived, Squelsh congratulated him on the success of his unit during their recent training exercise and informed him that he had a new assignmentâ€”to assist two Jedi on a mission to the planet Ord Cestus. After the briefing, Nate asked Squelsh if Admiral Arikakon Baraka, the overseer of the training camp, had mentioned anything about the achievement of his unit during their recent training exercise. Squelsh replied that Baraka was satisfied with the performance of his troops before she dismissed the ARC trooper.\nApted Squelsh was a Mon Calamari with large, dark eyes. She told Nate of her satisfaction with him when his unit cut their simulated and real death-rate by 50 percent while retaining their efficacy in the training exercise. Upon the clone's request, she also informed him about Admiral Baraka's comment regarding the achievement of his unit.\nSquelsh appeared in the 2004 novel The Cestus Deception, written by Steven Barnes.",
