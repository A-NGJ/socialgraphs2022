 "content": "Captain Durgur Pyne was a male Zabrak member of the Corellian Security Force. During the time of the Galactic Civil War, he was the head of security in the city of Nashal on the Twin World of Talus.\nSometime following 0 BBY, he and his men faced problems with a pirate gang and the local sleemo thugs. Since he did not have enough men available, he employed the aid of a spacer willing to help. Pyne first tasked the spacer with rescuing one of his best agents, who was kidnapped by the sleemos. The spacer succeeded in the rescue, allowing the agent to provide Pyne with the location of the pirate leader, a notorious and dangerous criminal.\nThe spacer helped him track down and arrest a murderous pirate lieutenant, freed a kidnapped CorSec agent from the hands of Sleemo thugs and eliminated the leader of a pirate organization for which Pyne paid him a fair amount of credits.\nDurgur Pyne was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
