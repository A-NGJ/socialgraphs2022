 "content": "Sivarra Mecheaux was a Force-sensitive female Human who lived in Aurilia during the time of the Galactic Civil War. She was the village's medic and was kept busy healing those left wounded from the attacks of the Dark Jedi Mellichae and his Sith Shadows.\nAfter the village had grown into a township, Sivarra had less work as a medic, so she started selling useful trinkets to adventurers.\nSivarra Mecheaux was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. She was part of the village of Aurilia where players solved various quests to become a Jedi, but was removed as part of the New Game Enhancements of 2005, along with Aurilia.\nShe was brought back into the game with Chapter 7 in November 2007, along with the new township of Aurilia. She could be found in a medical building, but now served as a vendor where players could buy items with special tokens which could only be acquired by taking part in one of the high-level instance dungeons known as \"Heroic Encounters\".",
