 "content": "Westerli was a human pirate who was part of a crew hired by Maliss and Sorath to operate a mobile way station, stealing components from Project Stardust for Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit. When the station was attacked by Grysks, Westerli was one of the survivors who were captured and taken prisoner. The Grysks, through interrogation, tried to force the pirates to serve them. While the torture did not work on all members of the crew, fellow pirate Bleary suspected it was working on Westerli.",
