 "content": "Kant Aryon was a male Human and the husband of the Imperial Governor of Tatooine, Tour Aryon. Kant was the son of a Baron and Baroness, growing up in the lap of luxury on Bethars.\nThe husband of the Governor of Tatooine was best described as a con-artist; being an agent serving the depths of the underworld gangsters for a long time. Aside for his love to cheating people, he felt a vast loyalty to his wife as well.\nAfter marrying his wife, Kant realized that what he was doing in life was putting his family at risk. It changed him from being a risky gambler to a nervous coward doing whatever it took to keep his underworld life separate from his love life.",
