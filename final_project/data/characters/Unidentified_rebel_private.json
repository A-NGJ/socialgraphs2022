 "content": "A human individual served as a private in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the private was part of a geological survey team that investigated the planet Ab Dalis to ensure it was stable enough for the Alliance's Eleventh Division to set up camp after they arrived at the planet following the scattering of the rebel fleet after the Battle of Hoth. Eventually, the division was found by the assault group of Imperial Commander Ellian Zahra who sent the Star Destroyer Ultima II commanded by Admiral Kalaxo to destroy the Eleventh Division. During the battle, the Alliance's Starlight Squadron arrived to assist the Eleventh Division, and after they heard that Luke Skywalker was part of the arriving squadron, the private came up with a plan of firing on a mountain, that in reality was a dormant volcano, to cause it to erupt and destroy the Star Destroyer with magma. The plan worked and the Eleventh Division was rescued and eventually grouped up with the Alliance's Fourth and Seventh Divisions.",
