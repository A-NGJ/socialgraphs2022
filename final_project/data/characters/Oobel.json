 "content": "Oobel was a Gupin from the Forest Moon of Endor. He was the brother of Mring-Mring and the cousin of Punt.\nWhen Punt rose to the throne, the key to the Juniper Chest was stolen by the Grass Trekkers, thus preventing the Gupins from refreshing their powers. In desperation, Oobel sought out the outcast Mring-Mring, convinced that he was a prophesied future king of their people.\nWith the help of the Ewoks, Wicket Wystri Warrick and his friends' help, the key was recovered. However when circumstances forced Mring-Mring to attempt to open the chest without the key and succeeding, he was proclaimed king and he immediately appointed Oobel as second in command.",
