 "content": "Ram Zerimar was a male Human Mandalorian sniper during the time of Boba Fett's stint as Mandalore c. 40 ABY.\nRam Zerimar wore gray Mandalorian armor, with golden markings on the right half of his armor, and a small, charcoal handprint of his baby adorned his helmet. He favored a Verpine shatter gun.\nHe accompanied Goran Beviin along with other Mandalorian commandos to meet Fett at Zerria's Bar on Drall to discuss whether to accept Thrackan Sal-Solo's commission to fight for the Corellians and defend Centerpoint Station from the Galactic Alliance while it was being repaired. Zerimar decided—just like the others—it was best not to get involved.\nZerimar later accompanied Fett and several other Mandalorians when Fett was hired as backup by Admiral Daala during the Second Battle of Fondor. When they stormed Bloodfin in order to take down the Imperial Moffs, Ram formed the backup in a Tra'kad, together with Ghes Orade.\nThe character Ram Zerimar is based on Raymond Ramirez , an American soldier  with a special connection to Star Wars and Karen Traviss. His blog \"Mando'ade and Their Toys\" was featured on StarWars.com.",
