 "content": "Mac Moria was a Rattataki male who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. He was part of Imperial strike team during the events of the Conquest of Makeb acting as a supply officer for fellow Bounty hunters.\nMac Moria appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, and the expansions Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Knights of the Fallen Empire, as a Rakata Gear vendor for the Bounty Hunter class. During a restructuring of the game's gear system in Game Update 2.0, he was changed to a Basic Gear vendor. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
