 "content": "Sash Ketter was a human female pilot of the New Republic. She, along with pilots Trapper Wolf and Jib Dodger, was sent to follow a distress signal sent from the Bothan-5, a New Republic Correctional Transport, that had been infiltrated by mercenaries. Arriving at its location at a space station the three pilots identified a gunship being deployed and destroyed it, proceeding to fire on the space station after.\nSash Ketter was a pilot for the New Republic's Starfighter Corps. In 9 ABY, She was part of a New Republic attack squadron with fellow pilots Trapper Wolf and Jib Dodger. Their duties included locating certain active New Republic tracking beacons.\nOne such beacon was activated by the New Republic soldier Lieutenant Lant Davan when the Bothan-5, a New Republic Correctional Transport, he served on was infiltrated by several mercenaries. The beacon itself was then taken aboard the gunship Razor Crest and to a space station controlled by the criminal Ranzar Malk. Having followed the beacon, Ketter, Wolf and Dodger arrived before the space station on T-65B X-wing starfighters, passing the Razor Crest after they exited hyperspace. Wolf confirmed the beacons signal and identified a gunship which was preparing to launch from one of the stations hangars. Although this gunship was targeting the Razor Crest, Ketter and her squadron proceeded to fire on the hangar, destroying the ship. The trio then circled around station, firing on its exterior.\nSash Ketter was a human female who had tan skin, black hair and brown eyes.\nKetter wore an orange and white flight suit and a white K-22995 light flight helmet with blue and yellow markings and two New Republic roundels.\nSash Ketter first appeared in Chapter 6 of the 2019 television series The Mandalorian, which aired on December 13, 2019, portrayed by Deborah Chow, the director of Chapter 3 and Chapter 7 of the series. Chow made her cameo appearance alongside fellow series directors Dave Filoni and Rick Famuyiwa, who portrayed Trapper Wolf and Jib Dodger respectively. According to Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, who played the New Republic pilot Carson Teva in The Mandalorian Season Two, Chow had been suggested to reprise her role as Ketter alongside him in the Season Two episode \"Chapter 10: The Passenger,\" but was replaced by Filoni as Wolf as Chow was busy with her show Obi-Wan Kenobi.",
