 "content": "A Sith Lord of Human or Sith pureblood descent of the reconstituted Sith Empire was a member of the Order of Revan, a secret society on the planet Dromund Kaas devoted to the teachings of the former Sith Revan, several decades before the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic. When the Order was forced to stop meeting in the Imperial capital of Kaas City for fear of retribution, the Sith Lord offered the use of the Sith's compound as a shelter. However, the Sith was soon assassinated, which forced the Order to retreat deeper into the jungles of Dromund Kaas.\nThe Revanite Sith Lord was first mentioned in the Codex entry for the Revanite Compound in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011, but the Sith's name, species, and gender were not specified. However, the entry was never made accessible in the final release of the game until 2016.",
