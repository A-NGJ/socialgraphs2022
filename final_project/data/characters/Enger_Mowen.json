 "content": "Enger Mowen was a male Human who ran the Imperial Recruitment Center in Isttu Village aboard the Ithorian Herdship Bazaar during the Galactic Civil War. He started a rumor that he was really an Alliance to Restore the Republic sympathizer, and could direct people to join the Rebellion. In reality, he was using the information to seek out potential Rebels and pass their names to the Galactic Empire. Mowen was fat with unpleasant personal habits.",
