 "content": "Halle Dray, a Human female and a native of the planet Alderaan, was one of the thousands of Alderaanian refugees who fled to the planet Delaya following the Destruction of Alderaan by the Imperial Death Star battlestation. While on Delaya, Dray and J'er Nahj, a Human male, looked after a young boy Shell, who had been orphaned after the attack. Dray was a member and a leader of a group of Alderaanian refugees whose members loathed Princess Leia Organa, as her actions had caused Alderaan to become involved with the Rebellion, which in turn led to Alderaan's involvement in the Galactic Civil War, and later its destruction. In 0 ABY, the group captured Organa as part of a plan to turn the Princess in to the Empire, and to be rewarded with a new planet for Alderaanian refugees. However, the Imperials betrayed Dray's group, which led to her death.\nA Human female, Halle Dray lived on the planet Alderaan during the time of the Galactic Civil War, a major galactic conflict fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Alderaan was destroyed in 0 BBY by the Galactic Empire's Death Star battlestation at the order of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin in order to demonstrate the destructive firepower of the battlestation on a world sympathetic to the Rebels, resulting in the complete annihilation of Alderaan and its inhabitants. Dray was off-world when the Destruction of Alderaan occurred, and she afterward fled to the planet Delaya in the Alderaan system, which had been the sister world of Alderaan before the latter's demise. Dray became one of the leaders of a group of Alderaanian refugees who loathed Princess Leia Organa of the Royal House of Alderaan, as her actions had gotten Alderaan involved with the Rebellion, which in turn caused Alderaan's involvement in the Galactic Civil War and its subsequent destruction.\nAfter her homeworld's end, Dray and J'er Nahj, a Human male, looked after a young boy named Shell, an orphan of the attack. Later, in 0 ABY, Dray and her followers confronted Organa before the Princess participated in a meeting with Alderaanian survivor groups to entice them to join the Rebel Alliance. Dray accused her of loving war, and the group kidnapped Organa by tossing her into a speeder truck. Dray and her followers hoped to turn Organa in to the Empire in exchange for a new planet for Alderaanian refugees. While in custody, Organa tried to escape, but the faction stopped her. When they arrived at an abandoned building, Dray and her followers contacted the Imperials and turned in Organa for the reward for which they had long hoped. However, the Imperial party—comprised of four stormtroopers and an Imperial officer—betrayed Dray and her followers, and they killed most of the group, including Dray, with blasters. Organa, on the other hand, would be later rescued by Rebel forces.\nHalle Dray was a determined woman who wanted peace for herself as well as her fellow Alderaanians. She only felt hate toward the Organa family, as she believed that they had ruined many of Alderaanians' lives as well as hers. Dray was also one of the leaders of a group of Alderaanian refugees who loathed Princess Leia Organa, as her actions had cost Alderaan its destruction. Dray's leadership in the group contributed to the downfall of the faction, leaving most of the group dead, due to the fact that Dray had not suspected that the Empire would betray them.\nHalle Dray first appeared in the novel Rebel Force: Hostage, released in 2008. The novel was written by Alex Wheeler.",
