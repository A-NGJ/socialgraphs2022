 "content": "Krismo Sodi was the leader of the Kage Warriors, a band of Kage combatants from the planet Quarzite who opposed the rule of the Belugan dictator Lord Otua Blank. During the year 20 BBY, Lord Blank had Sodi's younger sister, Pluma, kidnapped with the intention of making her his bride. In response, Sodi led a number of Kage Warriors on a rescue mission to prevent Pluma from falling into Blank's hands. The Kage assaulted Blank's subtram, which was carrying Pluma, and defeated the majority of hired bounty hunters and Belugan guards who were protecting the Belugan operation. The Kage suffered heavy losses, however, and Sodi was eventually left as the sole survivor.\nDespite this, Sodi killed Blank's military officer Major Rigosso and bested the bounty hunter leader Boba Fett. Before he could secure Pluma, Sodi was attacked and subdued by the last remaining bounty hunter, Asajj Ventress. Although Ventress initially planned to deliver Pluma as planned, she changed her mind at Pluma's urging. After paying out a ransom to Ventress, Sodi and his sister were released.\nKrismo Sodi was a male Kage from the planet Quarzite. He had a young sister, Pluma Sodi, and acted as the leader of the Kage Warriors, an elite fighting force made up of Kage, during the year 20 BBY.\nDuring the year, the Kage were engaged in a civil war with the Quarzite dictator Lord Otua Blank, a member of the co-inhabiting Belugan species. During the conflict, Kage Warriors attacked and looted Belugan subtrams. Although Blank's own military force, led by the Belugan officer Major Rigosso, was considered elite, they were nonetheless outmatched by Sodi's warriors.\nAt some point, Lord Blank took a carnal interest in Pluma Sodi and formed a mission to kidnap the Kage girl and force her into a marriage with him. As such, Pluma was kidnapped by Blank's soldiers. In response, Sodi devised a rescue mission with the other Kage Warriors and learned that Pluma was to be transported to Otua Blank's stronghold via subtram. The Kage located the subtram station and then laid in ambush. However, the Belugans were wary of Sodi's intervention, leading to Major Rigosso, who operated as the leader of the Belugan mission, to hire a contingent of bounty hunters to defend the subtram..\nAs soon as the Belugan subtram departed for Blank's stronghold, the Kage, riding centipede-like milodons, sprung their attack. The milodons kept up with the subtram, and Sodi directed his warriors to board in groups. Sodi watched his men battle their way past the bounty hunters Dengar and Asajj Ventress on the subtram's caboose and move further along the train. Despite mounting Kage losses, most of the bounty hunters and two Belugan guards were thrown from the train during the prolonged skirmish. Sodi, now one of the last surviving members of his rescue party, was the last to board the tram to take on the few remaining defenders.\nSodi first ran into Latts Razzi and the droid C-21 Highsinger and, after a break-neck paced duel, both bounty hunters were thrown from the train. Following that, Sodi encountered Major Rigosso, who barred access to the subtram car Pluma was in. After laughing in Sodi's face over the Kage's tenacity, Sodi killed Rigosso with a thrown electro sword.\nSodi found his sister contained within a box in the car, but before he could reach her, he came face to face with the bounty hunter leader, Boba Fett. During the subsequent brawl, Pluma's box was knocked over and opened when Fett was thrown into it. Fett, who had been unaware of the nature of the cargo until now, attempted to aid Pluma, but recoiled when she hit him. Fett was subsequently knocked out by Sodi. Before the Sodi's could take off, however, they were met with a final obstacle, Ventress, who had escaped her attackers from the caboose.\nA former dark side assassin and veteran soldier of the concurrent, on-going Clone Wars, Ventress beat Sodi after a brief fight and tied him to a chair.\nAlthough Ventress and Fett decided to continue with the mission, Pluma pleaded for her and her brother's release. Pluma struck a chord with Ventress upon describing the terror of being torn from one's home. Ventress, who had recently suffered a heavy loss of her own on her homeworld, ultimately sympathized with the siblings' plight. Fett argued with Ventress, and was summarily bound, gagged, and stuffed into Pluma's box as a result.\nAfter delivering Fett to Lord Blank, Ventress forced Sodi to have the Kage Warriors pay a ransom for Pluma's release. Although Sodi was hesitant, finding Ventress to be untrustworthy, he nonetheless agreed and had the Kage pay the ransom. Ventress honored the agreement and let Pluma go. Before departing on a milodon alongside her brother, Pluma thanked Ventress for her mercy.\nThe most skilled member of the Kage Warriors, Krismo Sodi was willing to risk both his life and the lives of his men to orchestrate a rescue mission to deliver his sister from the clutches of Lord Otua Blank. Sodi was protective of his sister, and was undaunted by the opposition that he battled through. Despite defeating the bounty hunters with non-lethal means, Sodi killed Major Rigosso when the Belugan tempted Sodi to do so. Upon meeting Asajj Ventress, Sodi did not hide his contempt for her.\nUpon finally seeing Pluma again, he instantly rushed to her aid to see if she was alright. Although Pluma was surprised that Sodi had gone through the effort to save her, they were nonetheless happy to see each other again. Later on, Sodi started being distrustful of Ventress when she saved Pluma from Lord Blank, and contemplated the idea that after receiving her ransom from the Kage, Ventress would only turn the siblings over to the Belugans. However, he was proven wrong when Ventress honored their deal.\nSodi was a Kage male with gray-colored skin that incorporated dark gray tattoos. Standing at 1.89 meters tall, Sodi also possessed golden eyes and black hair that had a white hue. He kept his hair fashioned in a ponytail.\nAlthough most of Sodi's combat during the rescue mission was done whilst unarmed, Sodi carried two electro swords during the rescue mission and used one to kill Major Rigosso. He later used them again to disarm Boba Fett of his blaster pistols, but lost the swords in Fett's counterattack.\nLike all of the Kage Warriors, Sodi wore dark colored clothing, including a hood that covered his face. However, to distinguish himself from the others, Sodi's clothing was adorned with gold stripes and patterns.\nKrismo Sodi appeared in \"Bounty,\" the twentieth episode from the fourth season of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. In the episode, which aired on March 2, 2012, Sodi's voice was provided by Ben Diskin, who also happened to voice Sodi's nemesis, Otua Blank. The events of \"Bounty\" were later briefly mentioned in the novel Dark Disciple, written by Christie Golden.\nIn early versions of the story, both Sodi and his sister Pluma, who was originally named Pluma Sweet, were conceived as human lovers instead of siblings. The concept of them being brother and sister was brought up during editorial, and the change stuck. Sodi's design was also based upon conceptual artwork from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace by Iain McCaig, which was meant for the character Obi-Wan Kenobi. Holdovers from the design include a thin ponytail and the tattoo on Sodi's forehead.\nConcept art of Sodi for \"Bounty\" was developed by Will Nichols.",
