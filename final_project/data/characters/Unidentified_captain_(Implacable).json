 "content": "A Human male was the captain of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Implacable, which served in the fleet of the warlord Zsinj.\nThe captain was aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Implacable during the Battle of Ession against New Republic forces. When the tide of battle began to favor the New Republic forces, Admiral Apwar Trigit escaped from the Implacable by flying his personal TIE Interceptor out of the engagement. Trigit left instructions not to surrender and the captain was left in charge of the dying ship. He followed the Admiral's order by rejecting Commander Wedge Antilles's offer to break off hostilities where both sides would retreat. The captain was determined to fight on and kill as many New Republic personnel despite Baron Soontir Fel's—leader of the Empire's famed 181st Imperial Fighter Wing—recommendation to accept the offer. The captain proceeded to remind the ace pilot that he was not in charge and merely an observer when he was shot by Fel, who then took over command of the ship and accepted Antilles's offer.\nIt is not known if the captain survived the Battle of Ession after being shot by Soontir Fel, as there was no indication whether the blaster Fel used was set to stun or not.\nThe man who shot him was actually holostar Tetran Cowall in disguise as Fel as part of Zsinj's plan to trap Rogue Squadron.",
