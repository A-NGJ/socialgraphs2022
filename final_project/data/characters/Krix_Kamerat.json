 "content": "Krix Kamerat was a human male who lived on Trymant IV during the High Republic Era, the best friend of Zeen Mrala. Raised by the Elders of the Path to believe that it was wrong for any living being to touch the Force, Krix was unaware that Mrala was Force-sensitive and desperately attempting to suppress her abilities. In the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Trymant IV came under threat from an Emergence and a Nihil attack simultaneously, and Krix attempted to approach the pirates for assistance. An encounter with a Jedi team which had arrived to provide aid led to a rift between Krix and Mrala after she was forced to use her Force powers against the hyperspace debris raining down on Bralanak City, as Krix accused Mrala of lying to him.\nHis anger at his friend's apparent lies drove Kamerat to stay with the Nihil, claiming to Eye Marchion Ro that Mrala meant nothing to him after the Eye reminded him of her deception. As time went by, Kamerat embraced the ways of the Nihil, becoming a protégé of sorts to Ro and joining his inner circle as their war with the Republic dragged on. He became ruthless, forcing Mrala and her new Jedi family to hunt down her former best friend. Despite having deep down believed her friend would only either bring joy or sorrow to the galaxy, Mrala was surprised to see how far her friend had fallen as he led a campaign of death and destruction across the Outer Rim Territories. Kamerat was finally captured during the battle at Dol'har Hyde.\nKrix first appeared in the first issue of the comic series Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures, which was written by Daniel José Older, illustrated by Harvey Tolibao, and published by IDW Publishing on February 3, 2021. In a synopsis initially released by IDW Publishing on their website, Krix's name was misspelled \"Kriz\". The character's surname, Kamerat, was first identified in the subsequent second issue, written by Older and published by IDW on March 3, 2021.",
