 "content": "The Neetha Den was a Selonian den that lived on the planet Talus during the Galactic Civil War.\nThe Neetha Den lived on Talus, in the Corellian system. The Selonians inhabited a cave near the city of Nashal. The den was led by the den mother Kiisa Kimotte and included the sept Kiki Dorente, advisor to the den mother, Tika Sileste, Ravi Thienta, and Lika Fimente.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, a member of the den proposed the so-named Askura deal, a partnership with a group of Talusian smugglers based nearby. However, the deal was fake and the Selonians were soon exploited by the smugglers. Several Selonians of the den were captured by the smugglers and kept as hostages in order to force the rest of the den into mining for them. The situation generated anti-human sentiments among the Selonian population of Talus and hostile anti-human demonstrations erupted in the city of Nashal. Despite no act of violence against Humans was reported, the local police force and the Cluster World Relations agency issued a travel warning for Nashal. Via Corellia News Service, Marx Grocco, Director of Cluster World Relations, explained that this preventive measure was meant to insure the public safety of Talusian human citizens and human travelers for any possible hostile encounters with non-human protestors.\nIn 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force discovered the situation but was unable to intervene because Selonians refused that Corellians might be involved in their matters. Agent Taarna thus recruited an independent spacer in order to help the Selonians without involving the CorSec. The spacer met Kiki Dorente, the advisor to the den mother, in the den's cave and the Selonian accepted the assistance. Dorente first tasked the spacer to reconnoiter the Smuggler Base where her den mates where supposedly held. After the spacer successfully returned with the information requested, Kiki and other Selonian mates developed a strategy against the smugglers. Tika Sileste requested the spacer to eliminate the smuggler guards and destroy the droids in the base. Ravi Thienta asked the spacer to recover stolen Selonian's supplies and destroy the smugglers weapons cache. Lika Fimente tasked the spacer to find the captive Selonians in the base. Furthermore, Kiki Dorente sent back the spacer to the smuggler base in order to gather information about the destination of the cargo shuttles leaving the base. Although the spacer achieved most of the objectives, the assault was only a partial success. The spacer defeated most of the smugglers, including their leader, and crippled their ability to exploit the Selonians. However, the spacer discovered that the captive Selonians had already been shipped to Ord Mantell and sold as slaves. The spacer also discovered that a traitor in the Selonian den intentionally helped the smugglers. As the situation with the smugglers was concluding, the spacer was eventually awarded the title of den mate by the den mother.\nThe Neetha Den appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. The Neetha Den was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
