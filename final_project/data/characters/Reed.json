 "content": "Reed was a human male X-wing pilot for the New Republic. He held the rank of lieutenant in the New Republic Starfighter Corps and was paired with Captain Carson Teva during their patrol above the planet Tatooine. There, they pulled over a rebuilt N-1 starfighter piloted by the Mandalorian Din Djarin and the lieutenant tried to run tabs on the N-1's pilot.\nTeva overrode Reed and let Djarin off with a warning. Recognizing the Mandalorian's voice, the captain connected him with a prior incident and asked to question Djarin, who sped away from the New Republic pilots instead. Reed mistakenly thought Djarin had jumped to hyperspace and wondered if the N-1 starfighter was worth reporting until Teva brought up the chore of filling in reports at their base.\nDuring the reign of the New Republic, Reed served as a pilot in the New Republic Starfighter Corps with the rank of lieutenant. Around 9 ABY, he was on patrol with Captain Carson Teva at the desert planet Tatooine, the pair flying T-65B X-wing starfighters, when they caught a rebuilt N-1 starfighter doing a very fast flyby of a passenger liner. Reed and Teva pulled the starfighter over and the lieutenant asked the N-1's pilot, the Mandalorian Din Djarin, to run the fighter's beacon. When Djarin asked what he had done wrong, Reed claimed he was not allowed to fly that fast next to a commercial starship or without a beacon.\nApologizing to Reed, Djarin ran his beacon, and the lieutenant noticed the N-1 starfighter's engine model did not match its power drive. The Mandalorian insisted that his fighter was newly built and being tested, not having an updated registry. Reed asked Djarin for a ping, but was told the fighter was not equipped for that yet, and so advised the Mandalorian to give up his flight controls for remote piloting from the New Republic fighters. However, Teva overrode Reed and let off Djarin with a warning. Recognizing the Mandalorian's voice from a prior encounter, the captain connected Djarin to an incident on the planet Nevarro.\nAfter Teva asked Djarin if he could answer some questions, the Mandalorian activated his fighter's sublight thrusters and sped away from Reed and the captain. Reed assumed the starfighter had jumped into hyperspace but Teva identified the use of thrusters to the lieutenant. Reed wondered whether the N-1 fighter should be reported, but Teva sarcastically asked him whether he wanted to fill out reports at their base all day, which the lieutenant declined.\nReed was a human male with blond hair and beard, blue eyes and light skin. He was insistent with protocols, asking for as much verification as he needed with Din Djarin and questioning whether the Mandalorian's N-1 starfighter should be reported, although he was happy not to be stuck at base filling out reports.\nReed wore an orange flight suit with a white flak vest, a Diagnostech life support unit, and code cylinders in the pocket of his upper-left arm. He wore a white K-22995 light flight helmet with blue and yellow markings, and was adorned with a yellow New Republic insignia on both sides. He flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter with blue markings.\nReed appeared in \"Chapter 5: Return of the Mandalorian,\" the fifth episode of the live-action television series The Book of Boba Fett, where he was played by Max Lloyd Jones, who previously served as double for Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the series The Mandalorian.",
