 "content": "DV-692 was a clone stormtrooper officer of the Galactic Empire who served in the 501st Legion during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, he was stationed aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Devastator under the command of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. DV-692 participated in the Devastator's capture of the Rebel CR90 corvette Tantive IV and led a squad in searching for the passengers of the ship. In one of the corvette's passageways, the squad spotted the Alderaanian senator Leia Organa, and DV-692 stunned her as she tried to escape. His unit escorted their captive to Vader and then to the Devastator's prison.\nDV-692 was a Human male clone who served the Galactic Empire as a lower officer in the Stormtrooper Corps during the Galactic Civil War. He was a member of the elite stormtrooper legion known as the 501st, and was assigned to lead a squad within the legion. In 0 BBY, DV-692 was stationed aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator, commanded by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader.\nThat year, Rebel agents transmitted the stolen plans of the first Death Star, a new Imperial superweapon, to the Rebel CR90 corvette Tantive IV. Over the planet Tatooine, the Devastator pursued and captured the Tantive IV, which was the consular ship of Senator Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan. Led by an assault commander, DV-692 and his squad boarded the Tantive IV as part of the first wave of stormtroopers. After the Imperial troopers cleared out the initial Rebel resistance, Vader came aboard the ship and ordered the stormtroopers to search for the passengers of the Tantive IV and capture them alive.\nDV-692 split the troopers of his squad into two groups; he ordered half of them to search a passageway and secure a junction and led the rest to another corridor. The squad's orders were to search the passageways astern and forward. One of DV-692's squadmates spotted Organa hiding in a small alcove and alerted DV-692 of her presence; however, Organa outdrew DV-692's squadmate and shot him dead. Organa then tried to escape, but DV-692 stunned her with his E-11 blaster rifle. The squad escorted Organa to Vader, who ordered them to take the prisoner to the Devastator's holding facility.\nDV-692 wore full stormtrooper armor without rank insignia and used an E-11 stormtrooper blaster rifle during the battle aboard the Tantive IV.\nThe character of DV-692 first appeared in the novelization of George Lucas's 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, published on November 12, 1976 and ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster. In the novel, DV-692 wore rank insignia on his arm, but he did not have any such insignia in the film which was released on May 25, 1977. His first visual appearance was in the first issue of Marvel Comics's Star Wars series, published on April 12, 1977, written by Roy Thomas, and illustrated by Howard Chaykin, Jim Novak, and Marie Severin. Notably, only his right hand and feet were pictured in the comic.\nHis first live-action appearance occurred in the film A New Hope itself, in which he was portrayed by an uncredited extra. The scene was one of the last few of principle photography in the United Kingdom and was filmed sometime between June 29 and July 16, 1976, in Elstree Studios. DV-692's lines, performed by disc jockey Terry McGovern, were said over a walkie-talkie and recorded by sound designer Ben Burtt. The sound effect of his stun shot was a mix of an ARP synthesizer playing a note with a \"rising pitch and a delay\" to bombinate combined with the sound of an air cannon, and DV-692's helmet was missing a heat dispenser vent decal, which should have been located on the helmet's \"cheeks.\" In 2002, the A New Hope expansion set of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Trading Card Game was the first to identify the trooper as \"DV-692,\" a clone stormtrooper.\nThe script of the 1981 Star Wars radio drama, as presented in 1994's Star Wars: The National Public Radio Dramatization, addressed DV-692 as \"3rd Trooper.\" His line in the radio drama was a bit longer and suggested that he did not shoot Organa but that another trooper from his squad fired on her.\nDV-692's dialogue varies slightly from the various adaptations of the film, including the novelization, the radio drama, the Marvel comic, and the comic Contemporary Motivators: Star Wars published in 1977. Additionally, in the 1995 Classic Star Wars: A New Hope adaptation, the role of DV-692 and his companion shot by Organa is merged into that of a stormtrooper sergeant, who calls out Leia's presence and stuns her, though not before she manages to shoot two other stormtroopers.",
