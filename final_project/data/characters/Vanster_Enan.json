 "content": "Vanster Enan was the Ithorian owner and barkeep of Vanster Enan's Sop House. He was proud of his establishment and had a selection of drinks from across the galaxy. They were a bit high priced because of the difficulties of shipping into the Cularin system, so he also sold a house special, which was a homebrewed drink he called a \"fine Ithorian brandy.\"\nHe was the cousin of Vareesa Enan, and once bought her a ticket to Ralltiir. Vanster was also a cousin of Ulo Enan, who worked in the city of Rorkee, in Genarius.",
