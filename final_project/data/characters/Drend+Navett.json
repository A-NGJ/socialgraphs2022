 "content": "Drend Navett was a Human male who was a specialized covert operative working with in Imperial Intelligence. In 9 ABY, he was stationed on the homeworld of the Myomarans, during Grand Admiral Thrawn's control of the Empire.\nIn 19 ABY, he was sent with \"Vengeance\" cell, an elite strike team of Imperial agents. His unit instigated several anti-Bothan operations, including acts of sabotage and causing havoc in the protests. His cell was able to increase tensions, which would allow the Battle of Bothawui to commence, part of Moff Vilim Disra's plan to destabilize the New Republic by implanting evidence that the Bothans assisted in the Caamas Firestorm– the largest Imperial genocide in history. However, during the unit's final task to sabotage the planetary shield generators, Navett died after a baby mawkren, which had a bomb, blew up Navett. Despite his death, the battle was able to commence.\nDrend Navett was an Imperial Intelligence agent who led the \"Vengeance\" cell during the Caamas Document crisis of 19 ABY. As leader of this organization, he participated in several anti-Bothan operations, including acts of sabotage and the instigation of deadly riots, calculated to increase tensions within the New Republic. Navett was the agent who used a Xerrol Nightstinger during a riot on Bothawui in order to make it appear Han Solo and a Bothan leader named Rayl'skar had fired on the rioters.\nHis final mission was to sabotage Bothawui's planetary shield generators in the planetary capital, Drev'starn. During this mission, he and another agent, Klif, opened a pet store—Exoticalia Pet Emporium—as a cover. Using this cover, he was easily able to obtain metalmites which he was able to introduce to the shield generator buildings. When he and Klif offered to act as exterminators, they spread both insecticide and liquid nutrients. Afterward, with the help of two other agents  who were working at a nearby Ho'Din restaurant, he allowed hungry baby mawkrens with explosives strapped to their backs to follow a power conduit into the generator buildings. This was a suicide mission: after the first wave of mawkren took out the main walls of the generator buildings, he had to accompany the second wave to destroy the generator itself. Navett was killed in the explosion.\nNavett's mission was a success, even though harassment from Moranda Savich forced both unexpected delays and unplanned acceleration of operations. Even a fire which Savich set in his shop did nothing more than force him to begin his operations early. Navett would not collect any posthumous accolades for his efforts, however, as the Imperial Remnant went on to lose the ensuing Second Battle of Bothawui anyway.",
