 "content": "This unidentified Imperial commander served as the immediate successor of the admiral in command of the Super Star Destroyer Executor during its maiden voyage. After Darth Vader executed the admiral for doubting him, this Imperial officer assumed command.\nStrangely, this character bears an almost identical resemblance to the dead Imperial admiral whom he replaces to take command of the Executor, although the two should not be confused with one another.\nDespite this article's reference to this character as a \"commander,\" this should not be confused with the rank of commander. The comic Race for Survival does not identify this Imperial officer as holding any specific rank.",
