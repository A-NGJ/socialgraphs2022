 "content": "Shobbo Durron was a Human female electronics engineer who lived on the planet Corellia during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, she designed a power cell that was efficient and cheaper to manufacture than those on the market. However, Kazic Pendre, owner of the company Pendretronics, took her design notes and schematic, leaving her with nothing. In light of this, she tasked a spacer with securing her intellectual property, so that she could use it to start her own business. The spacer entered the Pendretronics headquarters and sliced Kazic Pendre's data terminal, successfully recovered the data, and brought it bach to Shobbo Durron. Around the same time, Kazic Pendre was killed by the Corellian Security Force after it was established that the businessman was also a member of the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council.\nShobbo Durron was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Shobbo Durron was added to the game with the update named \"Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives\", published on June 8, 2006.",
