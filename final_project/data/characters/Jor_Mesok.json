 "content": "Jor \"Oneshot\" Mesok was a renowned male sniper living during the Galactic War. He was a member of the Crimson Fang gang, which following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY took over Port Nowhere by force, planning to use the mobile space station as their base of operations. The Alliance sent a strike team on a mission to liberate Port Nowhere, who systematically rid the station of Outer Rim's most notorious villains, confronting Mesok and killing him.\nJor \"Oneshot\" Mesok appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as a boss during the \"Crimson Fang\" Uprising.",
