He commanded a massive creature known as the Thing from the Stars, which resembled a Tarsarian devourer.\nThe Nightmare Pilgrim appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, where he is the World Boss for the planet Voss. The Pilgrim and the Thing From the Stars, who can be summoned by clicking a tablet in the Gormak Lands, were added to The Old Republic in Game Update 1.2: Legacy on April 12, 2012.",
