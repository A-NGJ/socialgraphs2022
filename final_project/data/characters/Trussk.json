 "content": "Trussk was a male Trandoshan slaver who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he was a slavemaster of the Blackscale Clan and resided in the city of Keren, on the planet Naboo. In 1 ABY, Trussk and his slavers captured the Wookiee Arrworr and shipped him to Naboo. There, Trussk tortured the Wookiee for weeks. Around the same time, the Blackscale Clan was tracking a smuggler known as Cal Handro. Trussk wanted him dead for having smuggled slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. At some point, a group of spacers attacked Trussk's fortress on Naboo. These adventurers were investigating the disappearance of Cal Handro and suspected the Blackscale Clan to have captured him. A violent fight erupted and the spacer killed most slavers. Despite his great fighting skills, Trussk was also killed.\nTrussk was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011. Trussk was added to the game with the third chapter of the \"Secrets of the Syren\" quest line, released with the \"Publish 19,\" on June 29, 2005. The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"Chapter 1,\" published on June 8, 2006, due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the Battle of Restuss.",
