 "content": "Bern was a male Human who was the husband of Chai, and fathered a number of sons during the Clone Wars.\nAround 21 BBY, Chai's sister, the scientist Bant'ena Fhernan, was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Confederacy forced Fhernan to work for them by claiming that they would kill Bern and her other family members if she refused to co-operate with them. The CIS put Bern and Chai under surveillance and a Confederacy droidcam recorded footage of Bern, Chai and their children disembarking from a transport on the planet Alderaan while on their way to their annual camping vacation.",
