 "content": "\"Koho\" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He participated in the Battle of Devaron aboard the Separatist Munificent-class star frigate to recover a Jedi holocron that famous bounty hunter Cad Bane had stolen. Koho and fellow 501st Legion clone trooper \"Denal\" were attacked by Cad Bane, who killed them both and took Denal's armor to disguise himself and escape onboard a Galactic Republic-stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle.\nThe clone trooper known as Koho was born on the planet Kamino, a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, and served in the 501st Legion as a part of the Grand Army of the Republic. He participated in the Battle of Devaron, and while serving under Captain Rex, helped Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano attempt to recover a stolen holocron from the bounty hunter Cad Bane.\nAfter engaging Bane and his battle droids in a firefight aboard his personal Confederate Munificent-class star frigate, Tano separated from Skywalker's group and chased after the fleeing Bane, who had the stolen the holocron in his possession. Skywalker soon ordered Rex and the clone troopers to find the frigate's hangar and secure a transport while he left to find his Padawan.\nHowever, Bane's frigate soon endured heavy damage, and the clone forces were instructed to evacuate. Rex gave Denal and Koho the task of locating and assisting Skywalker with the capture of Bane. While searching the doomed ship, Koho and Denal found Bane, and attempted to force him to surrender. The hunter, however, overpowered them both and killed the two troopers, taking Denal's armor as a disguise to sneak aboard the Republic forces' ship.\nKoho first appeared in \"Cargo of Doom,\" the second episode in second season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars.",
