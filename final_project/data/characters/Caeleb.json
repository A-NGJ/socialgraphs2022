 "content": "Caeleb was a Human male born during the reign of the Galactic Empire who possessed an exceptional to connection to the Force. Caeleb's coming was foretold roughly one thousand years before his birth by a prophecy of a Child of Light and though he was unable to use the Force himself, through him other Force-sensitive individuals could access seemingly unlimited power in the Force. Caeleb's parents sought to shield him from his gift as he grew and raised him in a spot devoid of the Force on the planet Dalicron-4.\nIn 3 ABY, when Caeleb was five years old, his quiet life was shattered by the coming of the Dark Jedi Tol Skaros, who murdered Caeleb's parents and attempted to apprehend the child. Caeleb was rescued by agents of the Rebel Alliance resistance group but was soon after kidnapped by Skaros' master, the darksider Thaum Rystra. On the ice-covered planet ZXK-100346.6a, Caeleb assisted Rystra in the recovery of a powerful dark side relic. However, Rystra was attacked by the Rebel agents that had saved Caeleb previously on Dalicron-4 and the boy was freed from Rystra's control. The Child of Light was subsequently transported by the Alliance to a safe location.\nCaeleb was a Force-sensitive Human male who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire, and possessed an unparalleled connection to the Force that could be harnessed by other Force users to enhance their own powers. The subject of an ancient prophecy that heralded the coming of a \"Child of Light,\" roughly one thousand years before Caeleb's birth, the Jedi Master Duumas foretold the boy's coming. On the sparsely-populated planet Dalicron-4 in the Outer Rim Territories, Duumas sacrificed himself by merging consciousness into a tree to create bubble devoid of Force at which the child could reside. Caeleb was born in around 2 BBY to Force-sensitive parents and while in his mother's womb she could sense that there was something special about her baby.\nAfter Caeleb's father experienced a vision revealing the location of Duumas' Force bubble, the boy's parents took their son to the spot to raise him, settling at a homestead next to the Jedi's tree. Caeleb's parents sought to keep him away from strong Force influences as he grew up, hoping to protect him from his power until he became more mature. Caeleb was brought up in a happy environment, his parents endeavoring to ensure that he experienced only positive emotions. His parents also forbade him from passing beyond a stone wall surrounding their homestead that marked the boundary of the Force bubble. The failed Jedi Gel who lived on a nearby farm learnt of Caeleb's existence and came to watch over the boy.\nIn 3 ABY, when Caeleb was three years old, concerned that the Empire and Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader would find the boy and use Caeleb for their own ends, Gel sent word to the Rebel Alliance resistance group of the existence the child strong in the Force. Gel requested that the Rebel Jedi Luke Skywalker come to Dalicron-4 personally to escort Caeleb and the child's parents to safety. The Alliance leader Mon Mothma herself took an interest in Caeleb's plight. At around the same time, the Sith spirit Valik Kodank plotted to exploit Caeleb's Force potential to regain her physical form and she commanded her apprentice Thaum Rystra to capture the boy for her.\nRystra sent his protegee, the Whiphid Dark Jedi Tol Skaros, to Dalicron-4 to apprehend Caeleb. The mission was Skaros' first proper assignment for Rystra and he was keen to be successful in acquiring the boy. After torturing Gel and forcing the elderly Jedi to divulge the Child of Light's location, Skaros commanded a force of nek battle dogs and Viper probe droids in a raid on Caeleb's homestead. The boy was napping as Skaros began the assault and was awoken by his father's screams. Caeleb observed from a window as Skaros slew his father and the Dark Jedi's nek dogs brought down his mother, experiencing for the first time in his life feelings of unhappiness and dread. He hid under a bed, remaining silent to evade detection as a group of Rebel Alliance agents, who had been sent to Dalicron-4 in Luke Skywalker's stead to rescue the boy, defeated and killed Skaros.\nThe Rebels found Caeleb and the boy insisted that the Rebels bury his parents next to each other under Master Duumas' tree, believing that his mother and father would look after each other in death. Caeleb gathered up his belongings and plucked a leaf from tree and proffered it to one of the Rebels who was attuned the Force, leading to the Rebel experiencing a feeling of strength in the Force and a glimpse at Caeleb's power. The boy accompanied the Rebels to the nearby village Dalia and he was transported by them on the YT-1300 light freighter Lazy Katarn, accompanied by Gel's injured grandaughter Jhara to the Mon Calamari cruiser Home One Upon arrival the boy was placed in the custody of Lieutenant Kylbar, an aide to the Rebel leader Admiral Gial Ackbar, and Mon Mothma arranged for Caeleb to be escorted to a safe location.\nCaeleb was taken in the company of Kylbar to a Rebel safe world. However, Rystra tracked him there and at a landing pad the darksider mindtricked Kylbar into handing Caeleb over to him. As the next step in Valik Kodank's scheme to regain her physical form, Rystra sought out the Soulsaber, a powerful ancient dark side relic, and he kept Caeleb close to him owing to the artifact being protected in a place that only an individual not touched by the dark side of the Force such as Caeleb could access. The Rebel agents that had saved Caeleb on Dalicron-4 were dispatched by the Alliance to recover the boy and searched for Rystra and Caeleb for months as Rystra advanced his quest for the Soulsaber.\nIn around 4 ABY, four months after the death of Caeleb's parents, Rystra learned that a clue to the Soulsaber's location could be found on the Immerian Outback planet Pamorjal. While en-route to Pamorjal, Rystra stopped over on the moon Nar Shaddaa with Caeleb to rendezvous with representatives of the Pamorjal Freeman's League terrorist group. Rystra docked his starship in a private bay in a busy spaceport and Caeleb gawked as they disembarked, having never seen a starport before. Caeleb accompanied Rystra to a bar where he meet with representatives of the PFL. Once Rystra's business was concluded, the Dark Jedi and Caeleb returned to the spaceport and departed Nar Shaddaa, bound for Pamorjal.\nFollowing their arrival on Pamorjal, Rystra made contact with the PFL leader Davit Berek, instructing Berek to target the Rebel agents that were tailing him, and Caeleb was present during their conversation. From a complex of ancient Jedi temples on Pamorjal, Rystra identified that the Soulsaber could be found on the ice-covered Outer Rim planet ZXK-100346.6a and he traveled there with Caeleb to recover the artifact.\nAs they landed on the planet, Caeleb was apprehensive and cold, and the Twi'lek Force adept Sha'lia, one of the Rebels tailing Rystra, sensed remotely the emotions that the child was feeling. The Soulsaber was housed within the Cavern of Light, a cave complex settled by the Jedi Order millennia earlier, surrounded by a barrier of light side Force that Rystra could not cross. The Dark Jedi dispatched Caeleb to collect the relic for him as Rystra watched on and just as the Child of Light was about to hand over the Soulsaber, the Rebel agents arrived and attacked the darksider. Rystra levitated Caeleb over a chasm and threatened to drop the boy unless the agents allowed the Dark Jedi to leave with the Soulsaber unmolested. The Rebels subsequently gained custody of Caeleb while Rystra fled the world with the Soulsaber.\nCaeleb was taken by the Rebels back to the Rebel fleet. Kylbar awaited their arrival with four squads of veteran soldiers and Caeleb was escorted away and transported by the Rebels to a secret secure location. Three years later, in around 7 ABY, the Rebel agents ventured to a Sith temple in the Tascollan Nebula on the hunt for Rystra and a phantom version of the Dark Jedi conjured by Valik Kodank asked them how Caeleb was.\nAt the time of Tol Skaros' attack, when Caeleb was five years old, the boy's emotions where easily influenced. He had an innocent upbringing and was frozen in terror when he witnessed the death of his parents, experiencing feelings of terror and sorrow for the first time in his life. He cared for his parents and ensured that they had a proper burial be he agreed to leave Dalicron-4 with his Rebel rescuers.\nAs the heralded Child of Light, Caeleb had a strong presence in the Force, which radiated from him. Though unable to use the Force himself, Caeleb had a direct and unending connection to the Force. Other Force users could access seemingly unlimited Force energy and Force power through touching Caeleb, allowing feats that would usually be impossible to perform to be undertaken with ease.\nCaeleb was created by Lee Pickler and featured in the Child of Light saga trilogy of roleplaying adventures published by RPGA and set within Star Wars Legends continuity, within which he served as the eponymous \"Child of Light.\" He first appeared in the opening instalment of the trilogy, Child of Light, in 2000 and featured again in the second adventure of the trilogy, Soulsaber, in 2001. He was subsequently referenced in the third and final instalment in the trilogy, Light and Dark, in 2002.\nAn inconsistency exists between an outline of the Child of Light saga set out in Child of Light and the final adventure of the trilogy Light and Dark regarding Caeleb's role in the final act of the saga. In Child of Light it is stated that in the final part of the trilogy, Thaum Rystra takes Caeleb to Valik Kodank's Sith temple and attempts to resurrect Kodank by using the Soulsaber to convert Caeleb's Force energy into dark side energy. However, Caeleb is absent from the final Child of Light adventure Light and Dark and Kodank instead seeks to regain her physical form by attempting to possess Sha'lia. This article assumes that Light and Dark portrays the correct sequence of events and that Caeleb was not taken to Kodank's temple. Another inconsistency exists regarding Caeleb's gender. Though Child of Light, Soulsaber and Light and Dark consistently refer to Caeleb as male, the roleplaying statistics provided for Caeleb in an appendix to Child of Light states Caeleb to be female. This article assumes Caeleb to be male.\nIn Child of Light, the players roleplay as the Rebel operatives that Caeleb encounters on Dalicron-4 and at the Cavern of Light. As the Rebels travel to the Cavern of Light to rescue Caeleb it is possible for the Force adept Sha'lia to use her farseeing ability to sense how Caeleb is feeling. The subsequent fight between Thaum Rystra and the Rebels in the Cavern of Light can play out in a number of ways; if the player characters arrive at the cavern before Caeleb has handed the Soulsaber to the Dark Jedi it is possible for the Rebels to attempt to encourage Caeleb not to hand over the relic to him. When Rystra attempts to escape, one possible ploy that he can use is to levitate Caeleb over a chasm and to threaten to let him fall unless the Rebels allow Rystra to leave. Whichever way the battle plays out, Rystra ultimately takes the Soulsaber from Caeleb and the Rebels gain custody of the boy.",
