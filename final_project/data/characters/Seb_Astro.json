 "content": "Seb Astro was a human male Bespin Wing Guard in Cloud City working under Lando Calrissian as his top guard.\nSeb Astro was a Bespin Wing Guard who worked in Cloud City while Lando Calrissian was Baron Administrator.\nAt some point Bossk arrived at Cloud City and stole a barrel meant for Calrissian. Calrissian called in Astro to brief him in getting the goods back. Astro used the City's observation tower to assist him in tracking Bossk, who was fleeing in a Mining Pod. Shortly after tracking Bossk, Astro contacted the nearest docking bay so a docking bay droid could prepare a Cloud Car, where Astro quickly acquired to give Bossk chase.\nEventually Bossk arrived at a small asteroid orbiting Bespin where IG-88 was waiting for him. Lando's barrel was booby trapped and trapped Bossk magnetising him by his armor onto the barrel. Astro used this opportunity to capture and return Bossk and the goods back to Cloud City, where the contents of the barrel was a new cape for Calrissian, and Bossk was taken to jail.",
