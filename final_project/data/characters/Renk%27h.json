 "content": "Renk'h was a male, Twi'lek assassin, who operated during the Galactic Civil War. An excellent fighter, he was proficient in hand-to-hand combat and with weapons.\nBeing denounced by his employer after he failed to respect one of his contracts, Renk'h was incarcerated on Talman III, next to the target of an Alliance to Restore the Republic operation. The Twi'lek was ready to impersonate the thief if freedom was promised to him.\nRenk'h was created by Jean Balczesak for the ambiguously canon roleplaying scenario \"Hold-up galactique\" which appeared in the French magazine Casus Belli 62. He does not have any written role in the story, other than being one of the potential candidates for the thief known as \"the Rat\".",
