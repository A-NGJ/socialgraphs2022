 "content": "This Human male served as Sith Master Finn's apprentice during the final years of the New Sith Wars. He traveled to a planet with Finn and helped him plant a bomb in a building. After concluding business with an individual, they destroyed the building and proceeded to the landing pad where Finn's starship was located. On the way to the ship, the apprentice murdered the Toydarian slave owner Lod in order to free the indentured female Marka, who was being abused by the Toydarian. Finn promptly rebuked the young man for this act of compassion. After he was struck by Finn, Marka helped him up and attempted to use a mind trick to convince the apprentice to take her with the two Sith. He informed Finn, who was already aware of Marka's connection with the Force, and was instructed to deal with her. However, he did not deal with Marka, and later met Finn at the Sith Master's ship along with the woman. After Finn refused to take Marka with them, Marka seized the apprentice's lightsaber and threw him off the landing pad, sending the man plummeting to his death.\nThis Human male came under the tutelage of the Sith Master Finn during the final years of the New Sith Wars. He and Finn traveled to a planet and planted a bomb in a building. After he and his Master concluded business with an individual, they departed the building and detonated the bomb, destroying the building. As the apprentice and Finn made their way back to the landing pad where their starship was located, they encountered the Toydarian Lod and his slave, a young woman named Marka. The apprentice came to her defense when Lod struck her as retaliation for refusing to impress the two Sith. As Lod conversed with Finn, he called the apprentice a slave. The man immediately became enraged, igniting his lightsaber and ending Lod's life, freeing Marka.\nFinn immediately expressed his disappointment in the apprentice for his role in helping Marka. As the man interrupted, Finn argued that there was no place for compassion from a Sith, and punched the apprentice, knocking him to the ground. As Finn continued to his ship, the apprentice was helped to his feet by Marka, who attempted to use a mind trick to convince the young Sith to take her with him and Finn.\nHe informed Finn that Marka was Force-sensitive, and Finn—who had already sensed her strength with the Force—instructed the young man to deal with her. However, the apprentice and Marka followed Finn up the turbolift which led to the docking pad where Finn's ship was waiting. As the apprentice tried to talk to Finn, Marka begged the Sith Master to take her with them so she could learn the Sith ways. He refused, citing the fact that he already had the young man as his apprentice. Marka seized the apprentice's lightsaber and pushed the young man who had freed her from slavery off the landing pad, sending him plummeting to his death. Marka assumed the young man's role as Finn's Sith apprentice.\nThe apprentice wore a set of black robes and carried a lightsaber containing a red crystal. He also had a stone set on his forehead. The apprentice showed compassion by helping Marka to her feet and freeing her from Lod's captivity, though he was also resentful of being called a slave. He was unsure of what to do with Marka after she tried to convince Finn to take her with them.\nThe apprentice was able to sense Marka's Force-sensitivity. However, he was not immune to her mind tricks. He was capable of utilizing a lightsaber, using the weapon to kill the Toydarian Lod.\nFinn's Sith apprentice first appeared in the short comic \"The Apprentice\", which was featured in Star Wars Tales 17 and written by Mike Denning. In the comic, he was drawn by David Nakayama. The story was later compiled into a trade paperback version and republished in Star Wars Tales Volume 5. Plausible stories in Star Wars Tales 1–20 were initially viewed as S-canon until referenced in a non-Tales source, at which point the subject matter was elevated to C-canon status. The apprentice was mentioned in Finn's and Marka's entries in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, elevating the character's appearance in The Apprentice to C-canon.",
