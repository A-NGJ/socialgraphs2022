 "content": "Wizzel was a male Rodian majordomo who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nWizzel served as majordomo for Drik Bandrik, a mining business owner and slaver.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, former slave Kitster Banai attempted to improve the lives of the slaves on Tatooine. This led him to struggle against Drik Bandrik. In 1 ABY, Drik Bandrik tasked his employee Rakir Banai to deal with the troublemaker, deliberately concealing that Kitster was in fact Rakir's long missing son. After the man discovered the truth, Rakir decided to leave Bandrik's service despite he was still under contract. The man tasked a spacer to meet the majordomo Wizzel to retrieve his contract by force as Bandrik would not be eager to leave Rakir leave peacefully. The spacer tracked down Wizzel and fought him as well as some mercenaries. The spacer managed to kill them all, and obtain the contract. This allowed Rakir Banai to leave Bandrik and go in search for his son Kitster.\nWizzel was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts. The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.",
