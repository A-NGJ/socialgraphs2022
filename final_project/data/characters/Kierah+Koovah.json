 "content": "Kierah Koovah, nicknamed \"Gunny,\" was a Mimbanese female pilot who served as squadron leader of the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron. During the Galactic Civil War and following the Battle of Endor, Koovah fought against the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron. She flew a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft and sported a cybernetic arm.\nKierah Koovah, nicknamed \"Gunny,\" was a Mimbanese female. During the Clone Wars, she assisted the Galactic Republic's 224th clone trooper unit in battling Separatist Droid Army forces. She took a skyhopper but was shot down, and her left arm was trapped in the wreckage. She was able to escape, but lost it. After rendezvousing with the clone troopers, they were able to win the battle. At one point she was equipped with a cybernetic replacement for the arm. Gunny wished to train the young pilots in the squadron before retirement.\nGunny learned to shoot a blaster during the Mimban Campaign. Before the Battle of Endor, she was the leader of Vanguard Squadron, piloting a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft. Her squadron at that point consisted of Gracalia Vatara Sienar, Keo Venzee, and Feresk Tssat. The squadron was soon assigned a new unit leader, Commander Lindon Javes, when he assumed command of the New Republic MC75 Star Cruiser Temperance, and also received a new starfighter pilot who was assigned the callsign Vanguard Five.\nGunny was a veteran pilot with a lot of experience after seeing combat in the Clone Wars as well as the Galactic Civil War. She was a gruff but pragmatic person who was committed to helping her fellow pilots, particularly the younger ones.\nKierah Koovah appeared in the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons, voiced by Rebecca Wisocky.",
