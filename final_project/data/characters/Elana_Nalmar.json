 "content": "Elana Nalmar was the daughter of Ral and Emie Nalmar, and the presumed heir to the Nalmar crime family. Her inheritance was challenged by the arrival of Eelien Kirat, who she saw as an interloper into the family business. Elana was present at the Nalmar mansion when Qual'om Soach's forces attacked. She was badly injured in the assault and was recovered by rescue workers. When Elana recovered, she found that her parents and younger brother had been killed in the attack, and Eelien Kirat had taken control of the organization. Realizing that the majority of the organization supported Kirat over her, Elana knew that she had to gain the respect and support of the members before making a bid for power. In an effort to heal the rift between them, Kirat appointed Elana second-in-command of the Nalmar crime family.",
