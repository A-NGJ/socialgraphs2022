 "content": "A human male served as a general in the Galactic Empire's Imperial Military. At one point during the Imperial Era, Darth Vader tasked the general with deploying 50,000 troops to the Winnikk system, however, the general was only able to have 10,000 troops preparing to deploy as Imperial troops were spread thin throughout the galaxy, according to the general. Eventually, Lord Vader ordered a full report on the troop deployments, and the general reported on the status of the deployments. Unsatisfied, Vader Force choked the general to death in his meditation chamber, and tasked a MSE-6 series repair droid to remove the body.\nThe Imperial officer had a standard gray Imperial uniform with a rank insignia plaque that contained four blue tiles on the bottom row and four red tiles on the top row. Additionally, the officer made use of an Imperial kepi with an officer's disk, as well as a single code cylinder on the uniform's left pouch. The general had fair skin, brown hair, and a moustache.\nThe Imperial general was introduced in \"No Good Deed...,\" a mini-comic that was attached to the first issue of the Star Wars: Darth Vader  comic series.",
