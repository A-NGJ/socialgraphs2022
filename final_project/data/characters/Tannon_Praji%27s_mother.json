 "content": "Tannon Praji's mother was a Human female. She was the mother of Griff Praji, Tannon Praji and his brother.\nTannon Praji's mother was born years before 60 BBY to the influential House Praji on Coruscant. She always wanted to instill in her sons an appreciation for fine arts and culture, but did not want to limit them to what the capital had to offer. As a result, her entire family took repeated vacations offworld to such places as the museums of Porus Vida, and the Sharu ruins of the Rafa system.",
