 "content": "A Human male was a senator in the Galactic Senate, during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. The Senator was still serving on Coruscant—the capital world of the Republic—in 32 BBY. That year, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was removed from office following the invasion of the remote planet Naboo by the Trade Federation. The Senator was a man with brown hair, light skin and rosy cheeks. He would wrap himself in a heavy sheet of mauve fabric ornated with square motifs and golden lining, under which he wore an ankle-legth white tunic.\nThe draped Senator was to appear as a background character in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, in which he was portrayed by an unidentified extra. He was a member of the Alderaanian delegation led by Bail Organa, who was then played by Adrian Dunbar. However, the footage including the draped Human was left in the cutting room floor. Dunbar's appearance was later reused as the likeness of Bail Antilles, and two pictures of his draped colleague appeared in Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide, an interactive CD-ROM released in June 1999. Those promotional pictures were part of the \"Behind the Scenes\" section of the entry on galactic senators, and were captioned as \"A human senator in full regalia.\"",
