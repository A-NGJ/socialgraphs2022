 "content": "Galall was a male Sith Pureblood Sith Lord who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Galactic War. He was part of the Imperial strike team during the events of the Conquest of Makeb acting as an armorer for fellow Sith Warriors.\nGalall first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Rakata Gear vendor for the Sith Warrior class. During a restructuring of the game's gear system in Game Update 2.0, he was changed to a Basic Gear vendor. He was later removed in Game Update 5.0 on November 29, 2016, which retired the PvP and PvE gear vendors in favor of the Command system.",
