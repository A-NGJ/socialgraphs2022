 "content": "Naftrat Odarr was a Sullustan research and development officer who, like most Sullustans, originally worked for SoroSuub Corporation. Because of Odarr's engineering expertise , agents from Cybot Galactica were able to provide suitable enticement to defect. Odarr was promptly put to work finding new uses and modifications for the popular PK-series worker droid. The result was the Recon-PK series, perfect for corporate and military espionage. The droids found less savory use among slave-owners in Mos Espa on Tatooine.",
