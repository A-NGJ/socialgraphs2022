 "content": "Lude was a male Human TIE/LN starfighter pilot in the Imperial Navy that served as part of Alpha Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Villian Dance, that was assigned to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Steel Talon.\nLude was one of twelve pilots of Alpha Squadron assigned to chase down RLH-1, a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, but was instructed to hold back while the squadron leader attempted to convince the shuttle's pilot to surrender. Lude witnessed the shuttle destroyed by his commander after the pilot refused to return. He was one of two pilots assigned to examine the wreckage for survivors, but reported that none of the bodies were wearing space suits. Lude was more disappointed by the destruction of the brand-new shuttle than the loss of life the ship's destruction wrought.",
