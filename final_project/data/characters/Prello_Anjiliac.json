 "content": "Prello Anjiliac was a Hutt crime lord and part of the Anjiliac clan.\nWhen one of her employees, a Balosar named Barin Trevina, disappeared while attempting to acquire a Dark side object known as the Fell Star, Prello hired a group to find him. She agreed to pay 1,500 credits to each person in the group if Trevina were brought back alive and unharmed. She offered a further 1,500 each if they also brought back the object that Trevina had been searching for.\nAt under 200 years of age, Prello was relatively young for a Hutt during her time as a crime lord, and unlike others of her species, Prello seemed to genuinely care about the non-Hutt individuals that she employed. Though many of her clan resided on Point Nadir, she maintained a townhouse in the upscale part of Mos Eisley on the desert world of Tatooine.",
