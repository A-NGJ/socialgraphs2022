 "content": "Vortine was a male Voss who left his homeworld of Voss to visit the Galactic Republic's space station Carrick Station. He also sold his wares on Belsavis and on his homeworld.\nVortine appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2011, as a Voss Modification Commendations Vendor on Carrick Station, though he was later relabeled as a Level 45 Modification Commendations Vendor. Like his counterpart Shaleen, Vortine was not given an actual Voss name including a suffix.\nWhen patch 4.0 was released on October 20, 2015, Vortine appeared on other worlds , replacing the original armor, weapon, and mods vendors of those planets pre-4.0.",
