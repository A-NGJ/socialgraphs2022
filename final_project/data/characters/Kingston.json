 "content": "Kingston was a black haired, fair skinned, and brown eyed male Human who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic. By 3643 BBY, Kingston had obtained the rank of Grand Marshal and was stationed inside the palace of the Alderaanian Great House of Thul on the planet Alderaan, as the house had sided with the Empire and gained their support in the Alderaan Civil War. He specialized in melee combat, using a vibrosword to fight, and wore red armor whilst deployed.\nWhilst Kingston studied maps in the palace, he was attacked by an individual aligned with the Galactic Republic, who killed him.\nKingston first appeared as an enemy in Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG released by BioWare in 2011. Kingston is not involved in any quests in the game and is simply an elite enemy players of the Republic faction can choose to kill. This article assumes players killed him as part of 100% game completion.",
