 "content": "Yacek Sparkburn was a human male Jedi Knight who served at the Dalna Jedi temple during the High Republic Era while he was in his early twenties. Possessing a large physical and vocal presence, Yacek grew up on a compound belonging to the San Tekka clan, but was unaware if he was related to the famous family, although he shared his last name with the San Tekka cousin Jordanna Sparkburn. Yacek was also a talented chef and liked using the durga berry.",
