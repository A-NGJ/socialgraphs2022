She fell in love with Jedi Knight Iann Doaba. However, he exiled himself into the Doaba Badlands after murdering a rival for her love. After his departure, she was filled with grief, and had a painting drawn of her which visibly showed her grief. The painting was named \"Tejha Larel\", which was Old Corellian for \"Undying Love\". She went into the Badlands to try to find Doaba, but died in the search. Doaba later found her corpse and died of grief. It was later rumored that Doaba's spirit haunted the painting.",
