 "content": "Mehmet Alovar was a male Mon Calamari from Coral City who was born into the Mon Calamari aristocracy. In his later years, he was a highly respected individual among members of his species and was one of his people's emissaries to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. However, the Quarren viewed him to be a bigoted and short-sighted individual. During the Dac Peace Conference held by the Alliance to reconcile differences between the Mon Calamari and Quarren at some point following their revolt against the Galactic Empire, Alovar attempted to bring about a peaceful outcome, although he also stood fast in protecting the interests of his people.",
