 "content": "Alitra was a female Zabrak musician who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, she was part of a band that performed in the Bright Jewel system, playing the kloo horn. The band also included two other musicians, Alisia and Mako, and two dancers, O'choa Detera and Mestral. During that time, the band often played music and danced for the patrons of the cantinas of Tansarii Point Station and Nova Orion Station, two space station located near the planet of Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system. The band was known to cover popular songs from Tatooine, including \"Mad About Me\", \"Dune Sea Special\" and \"Lapti Nek\". Although Alitra and the musicians were very skilled, their lack of original songs sometimes drew criticism.\nAlitra was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Alitra and her band were added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005. The \"New Player Tutorial\" featured the band in the cantina of Tansarii Point Station. With the release of the \"Chapter 8,\" on January 15, 2008, Alitra and the band were also included in the cantina of the Nova Orion Station.",
