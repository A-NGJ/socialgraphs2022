He headed the Marasan government, called the Mindnet, making decisions based on information from the lesser Marasan elected officials  Like almost all Marasans, he was a cyborg, with a sophisticated computer implant used for communication and rapid computation.\nWhen the Galactic Empire conquered the Marasan people on Marasai and its colonies in the Marasa Nebula, Derra'makin was forced to flee. During the Imperial occupation, he stayed hidden on one of the colony worlds.",
