 "content": "Mir'Liss was a female Tarasin, who lived on the planet Cularin during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.\nMir'Liss was a member of the Jaraana irstat, a Tarasin tribe and by the time of the Clone Wars had became it's Irstat-Kes, or \"tribal leader\". When the Dark Jedi Raik Muun visited the village where the Jaraana istat lived in disguise as a Jedi, Morad'Ka, the Mother of the istat, refused to help her in obtaining a t'salak, so Muun returned the next day and set fire to the village. Mir'Liss directed the other Tarasin to get the fire extinguished and because of Muun's disguise, believed that the Jedi were responsible.",
