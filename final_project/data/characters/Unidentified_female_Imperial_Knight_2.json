 "content": "A Human female who wore her long brown hair in a ponytail was an Imperial Knight serving Emperor Roan Fel of the Galactic Empire in 130 ABY. After Fel's forces defeated the Galactic Alliance and won the Sith–Imperial War, the Sith allies of the Empire betrayed the Emperor. When Fel caught wind of an impending murder attempt on him by the Sith Lord Darth Krayt, he fled into exile and sent the brown-haired female and three other Imperial Knights against Krayt to distract the Sith Lord. The Dark Lord arrived at the Imperial Palace on the Empire's throneworld Coruscant and slew all four Knights before proclaiming himself the Emperor of a new Empire.\nA Human female with long brown hair worn worn in a ponytail was an Imperial Knight in 130 ABY. The Imperial Knights were an order of Force-users serving Emperor Roan Fel of the Galactic Empire, and in that year, the brown-haired female participated in a ruse devised by Fel against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt. Following the conclusion of the Sith–Imperial War, Fel was informed by Director of Imperial Intelligence Nyna Calixte that the Sith who had helped his Empire defeat the Galactic Alliance and win the war were intent on betraying him. Darth Krayt planned to murder Fel and seize the Imperial throne at an upcoming meeting of the Moff Council, and Fel accordingly fled the Imperial throneworld of Coruscant. Before doing so, he arranged for his double to meet with Krayt in the Imperial Palace and buy him time to escape.\nMohrgan Fel, an Imperial Knight and the Emperor's cousin, volunteered to lead the brown-haired female and two other Knights against Krayt in order to further the deception. The brown-haired female stood with her three brethren and surrounded the decoy Emperor as he and the Moffs discussed the consequences of the war being over. Krayt arrived with three of his fellow Sith Lords and demanded Fel's life, which prompted Mohrgan to call on the Knights to protect their Emperor. Krayt drew two lightsabers and quickly killed the four Knights despite their attempts at a defense. He then struck down the decoy Emperor and proclaimed himself the Emperor of a new Empire. Fel and the remaining Imperial Knights were forced into exile.\nThe brown-haired female was a member of the Imperial Knights, an organization whose membership was limited to those who displayed potential in using the Force. The Imperial Knights were considered to be among the most talented and dangerous Force-users in the galaxy. The Imperial Knights did not participate in the Sith–Imperial War at their Emperor's behest, but the brown-haired female battled a Sith following the war's conclusion. Darth Krayt easily dispatched her and three other Imperial Knights with his dual lightsabers.\nThe brown-haired female was one of four unidentified Imperial Knights introduced in the first issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Legacy, written by John Ostrander, penciled by Jan Duursema, and released in June 2006. The events of that issue were retold in Legacy's eighth issue , wherein three of the Knights remained unidentified and one was dubbed Mohrgan.",
