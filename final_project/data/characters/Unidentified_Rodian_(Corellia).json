 "content": "Between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, a Rodian who owned a YT-1300 light freighter traveled to the Corellian Engineering Corporation's YT-Series Warranty and Repair Shipyard B33 on the planet Corellia to have their ship fixed. As the ship underwent repairs, the Sith Lord Darth Vader traveled to Corellia in search of the ship that had assisted his son, Luke Skywalker, during the Battle of Yavin and made his way to the Rodian's ship at the shipyard. As the Rodian made their way down the ship's entry ramp, they encountered Vader and attempted to draw their blaster, but was killed by the Sith Lord.",
