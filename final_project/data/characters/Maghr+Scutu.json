 "content": "Maghr Scutu was a male Aquala Aqualish criminal who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nIn 1 ABY, Maghr Scutu visited Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system, in order to obtain a a rare plant that grew in the station's atrium. He thus contacted the smuggler Tarand Crowe in order to obtain a portion of this plant that could be used to make spice. Crowe accepted but he was not able to perform the job himself since he was watched by the authorities of the station. He instead recruited a spacer who agreed with serving as an intermediate. The spacer therefore met Maghr Scutu who provided information about the delivery and then managed to steal a portion of the plant undetected. The spacer later launched into space in his own starfighter, traveled to a rendezvous point in the Bright Jewel system and delivered the plant to another ship piloted by one of Scutu's henchman.\nMaghr Scutu appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Maghr Scutu was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
