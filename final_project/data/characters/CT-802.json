 "content": "CT-802 was a clone trooper who fought for the Galactic Republic in the Battle of Drongar in 20 BBY during the Clone Wars. During the battle, he was injured and contracted a lethal infection. On the brink of death, he was transported to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7. There, he was saved by Doctor Jos Vondar, who provided some of the valuable bota—a native Drongar plant with great medicinal qualities—for his treatment, violating the Republic's regulations not to waste bota on clone troopers.\nCT-802 was one of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on the planet Kamino to fight in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 20 BBY, during the Clone Wars, CT-802 served on the planet Drongar, where the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems fought for control of the planet's fields of bota, a highly-valued plant with exceptional medicinal qualities. As the brutal fighting raged on between the two sides, CT-802 was injured and was struck with a deadly infection contracted via a local mutated microbe. Unconscious, CT-802 was brought to the Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 to undergo treatment. However, the infection was unknown to the RMSU's doctors, and none of their medicine seemed to work, not even spectacillin, which usually helped against most of Drongar's microbe-carried diseases.\nCT-802's condition worsened with every minute: he had a fever that the doctors were barely keeping down with analgesic suppressors and coma induction; his liver was working overtime and was getting tired; his white blood cell count was off the charts; fluid began to fill his lungs; and his kidneys started to shut down. In addition, he had an erratic heartbeat secondary to cardiac tamponade, an emergency condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the sac that contained the heart. Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee, who was stationed at the RMSU, was able to stabilize the trooper with the Force, but she was not strong enough to sustain him for long.\nThe only thing that could potentially save CT-802 was bota, but the doctors were prohibited from using it, as the Republic had deemed the plant too expensive to waste on clone troopers. However, surgeon Jos Vondar possessed a secret supply of bota, inherited from his deceased friend and colleague Zan Yant. Having recently changed his views regarding the value of clone troopers' lives, Vondar was determined to save CT-802. Violating his orders, Vondar provided some of his bota for CT-802's treatment. After an intramuscular injection of bota extract, CT-802 got better. His fever was gone, and his organ systems were on the mend. All in all, the trooper was fully awake and nearly well, although his white cell count was still slightly elevated.\nLike all of Jango Fett's clones, CT-802 stood 1.83 meters tall.\nCT-802 first appeared in MedStar II: Jedi Healer, a 2004 novel written by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry. CT-802 later received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, published in 2008.",
