 "content": "This stormtrooper captain served aboard the Galactic Empire's Maw Installation. When a New Republic strike force lead by General Wedge Antillies arrived at the Installation, the captain was in charge of coordinating the defense of the facility, placing his troops at several key strategic points throughout the installation's hallways. He was also tasked with destroying the facility's main computer in order to erase information useful to the New Republic. Eventually, the captain, and several other Maw Installation personnel evacuated to the nearby Death Star prototype. Having prior piloting experience, he was tasked by Tol Sivron with flying the battlestation through The Maw and back during the Battle of Maw Installation and the concurrent Battle of Kessel. When the Sun Crusher piloted by Kyp Durron arrived and began to fire on the battlestation, Sivron took the controls from the captain and chased the tiny ship around the Maw as the superlaser fired. The stormtrooper captain was killed, along with everyone else onboard the prototype Death Star when the Sun Crusher lured it close to a black hole, causing it to be caught in its gravitational pull and sucked in.",
