 "content": "This individual was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.\nA Force-sensitive, this Human received training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, ascending to the rank of Jedi Master. Constructing a double-bladed lightsaber imbued with blue crystals at its core, this Master was proficient in it use during lightsaber combat.\nWhen the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, this man took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic. Surviving three years of war, he was stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple when the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order and issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, ordering them to kill their Jedi leaders. As the forces of the 501st Legion stormed the Temple as part of Operation: Knightfall, this man joined other masters and led a final charge against clone troopers on the Temple Veranda. While fighting valiantly against the clones under the command of Darth Vader, this Master and his companions were slain during the fighting and the Temple fell into the hands of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious.\nThis Jedi Master used a blue double-bladed lightsaber in combat. He was a talented swordsman as he was one of the last Jedi standing during the attack on the Temple.\nThe three Jedi Masters are killed by the player in Star Wars: Battlefront II, but the means of their execution is not standardized. They can be killed either as Vader or a clone trooper at the whim of the player.",
