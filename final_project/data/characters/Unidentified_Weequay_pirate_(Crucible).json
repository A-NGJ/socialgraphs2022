 "content": "A Weequay pirate was a member of the Ohnaka Gang during the Clone Wars.\nThis pirate, along with Hondo Ohnaka, Gwarm, and numerous other pirates, boarded the Jedi ship Crucible, in order to steal lightsaber crystals on board. After boarding the Crucible, Hondo ordered that the lightsaber crystals be found and for his men to kill anyone who stood in their way. This pirate was surprised by the command and spoke out against it, due to the ship occupants being children. The protests fell to deaf ears, though ultimately the plan failed, and resulted in the Ohnaka Gang's base being destroyed.",
