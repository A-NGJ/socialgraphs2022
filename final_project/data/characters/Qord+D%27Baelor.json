 "content": "Qord D'Baelor was a Human male who lived on Tatooine during the Galactic Civil War.\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Qord D'Baelor was doing business with the junk dealer Watto in Mos Espa. In 1 ABY, he could be found in the bar of the Mos Espa Starport. While here, he expected a delivery of swoop parts from Watto. Unfortunately, a local gang of teenagers called the Laser Flits ambushed the delivery of swoop parts before they could reach D'Baelor. W. Wald, overburdened by this turn of events, relied on a helpful spacer to retrieve the ten swoop parts from their hideout within the city.\nFortunately for Wald and his customer, the spacer succeeded in retrieving the parts. In addition, Wald also wished to buy engines from D'Baelor, which were retrieved from an old Y-wing model. In addition to delivering the swoop parts to D'Baelor, Wald also tasked the spacer with giving him a credit chip to pay for the engine parts. When the spacer found D'Baelor, he was thrilled to have been given the swoop parts, and was more than willing to part with his Y-wing engines.\nQord D'Baelor was a Non-Player Character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. He was added as part of the quest titled \"Wald's Woes\" with the release of \"Chapter 2: The Talus Incident\", on August 1, 2006. Players who performed a series of quests for Wald had to deliver and retrieve vehicle parts from D'Baelor.",
