He was stationed on Balmorra around 3643 BBY, when he was killed.\nMarren Atma appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic as a Champion boss on Balmorra. He is not directly involved in any quests, but can be killed for loot and as part of the achievement. This article assumes 100% game completion, which means he was killed.",
