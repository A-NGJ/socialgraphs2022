Raised in the cult, Garuk led his cultist through the ancient rites and blood rituals and professed to shun the influence of off-worlders and believed that no Tasari should ever leave their homeworld. However, while Garuk led the cult, he did not follow their tenets and had a taste for both the luxury that could only be provided by off-world technology.\nTelling his followers that he had to commune with the wilderness, Garuk would often go to a suite he maintained at the Imperial Hotel in Tasariq City. To fund this lavish lifestyle, Garuk sold the cult's Tasar crystals. As he was the only one allow inside the sacred inner sanctum, Garuk kept his crimes hidden from the cult.\nGaruk wore a golden amulet inset with three tasar crystals; citrine, peridot, and bloodstone. He also had a ceremonial headband with a jasper crystal, and a bracelet on his left arm fitted with a Tiger's Eye crystal.",
