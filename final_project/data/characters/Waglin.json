 "content": "Waglin was a male Weequay and friend of Cix Trouvee. He flew with Trouvee as the co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon in the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War, flying with him during the battle of Yag'Dhul in 5 BBY, when the Imperial forces targeted the gamblers on one of Yag'Dhul's outer moons, believing them to be supplying information to the Yag'Dhul insurgents.\nBy 43 ABY, Waglin lived on Oseon VII. He was still a close friend of the Trouvee family, even after Cix's death that year. Later that year, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, and their adopted daughter, Allana Solo, embarked on a quest to find out more about the Millennium Falcon's past. They spoke with Waglin, discovering from him that the YT-1300 light freighter had been bought from the Molpol's Traveling Circus.",
