 "content": "\"Kickback\" was the nickname of a clone trooper pilot who served in the Galactic Republic Navy. As part of Blue Squadron, with the callsign Blue Four, he and the rest of his unit were deployed in the Battle of Ryloth to break the blockade around the planet.\nLike all clone troopers serving in the Republic Military, Kickback was created by the Kaminoans for the sole purpose of serving the Galactic Republic. In 22 BBY, he and the rest of Blue Squadron were deployed to serve in the Battle of Ryloth. Under the command of Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, the squadron attempted to break the Separatist blockade around the planet. When the Separatist reinforcements arrived in the system, Commander Tano recklessly delayed the squadron's withdrawal, despite commands from Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen to return to the Resolute immediately. He managed to survive the battle, and flew with his fellow survivors as part of Ahsoka's second attack on the blockade.\nKickback was created for the The Clone Wars: Season One. He and several other clone trooper pilots were featured in Storm Over Ryloth, the 19th episode of the season.",
