 "content": "Ku-Kak was a Force-sensitive male wampa and the bodyguard of the Chevin slaver Phylus Mon.\nKu-Kak was found on an icy planet. Phylus Mon noticed the wampa's Force-sensitivity and chose him for his menagerie. Mon then took Ku-Kak to his zoo, and trained the wampa to be his personal bodyguard.\nPhylus Mon trained Ku-Kak in Chevin, so that the Wampa could not be affected by orders given in Basic. This made Ku-Kak immune even to mind-altering Force powers, except in the improbable case of a Chevin-fluent Force user.\nMon also taught Ku-Kak to hate the Jedi. To Ku-Kak's simple mind, a Jedi was any person wielding a lightsaber, and that person would be a primary target. At the same time, Ku-Kak learned to use his own Force powers to increase his battle prowess.\nWhen Phylus Mon made Ku-Kak his personal bodyguard, he also presented him with a Sith sword. This sword became Ku-Kak's weapon of choice. Rumors of Mon's trained wampa bodyguard soon spread.\nAt some point, Ku-Kak became the owner of a green-edged lightsaber which had belonged to Jedi Knight Ish-Bel Tur. Ku-Kak gave the lightsaber to Mischa Vorfren, one of Phylus Mon's slave bodyguards. Ku-Kak also learned that, while Vorfren might be using a lightsaber in combat, Vorfren was not a Jedi, and thus not a target for him.\nIn around 20 BBY, Ku-Kak accompanied Mon and some of his minions to the Almas Sith fortress, where they performed a raid killing four Jedi Knights during one of Mon's schemes. Ku-Kak's huge footprints would have been easily noticeable, but a sandstorm outside the fortress took care of them.\nLater, Phylus Mon, Ku-Kak and the survivors of the raid returned to Phylus Mon's mobile headquarters, the Animiasma. Unlike the other bodyguards, who stood in Mon's throne room with him, Ku-Kak was hidden behind a wall, so he could surprise anyone wanting to attack his master. Phylus Mon was attacked by a group sent by Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk.\nAlthough the roleplaying adventure A Mon Alone was written by Morrie Mullins, it includes a gratitude note to \"Jason Nichols, Ku-Kak's father.\" This might suggest that Nichols, probably the same Jason Nichols who is RPGA's Midwest regional director, created this character.\nKu-Kak's game statistics are mentioned as making him the most powerful enemy in the fight encounter. The gamemaster notes specify that Ku-Kak's appearance is optional.",
