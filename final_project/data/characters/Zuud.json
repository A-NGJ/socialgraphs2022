 "content": "Zuud was a female officer with the rank of Lieutenant attached to the Analysis Bureau of Imperial Intelligence. Zuud was one of the Empire's most effective interrogators. She loved to torture prisoners to get the information that she wanted, and was known for her ability to instantly determine a prisoner's limits.\nIn 0 ABY, Zuud was assigned to the Imperial base on Kalist VI.\nCharged with the interrogation and torture of Rebel agent Jorin Sol, Lieutenant Zuud used a scan grid to interrogate Sol. Lieutenant Zuud performed the interrogation with such enthusiasm and zeal that would plague the Rebellion far more than what an ordinary breaking would have done. Although she was joined in the torture sessions by another Intelligence officer with the rank of captain, he appeared to defer to her judgment.",
