During the Life Day live event from December 16, 2008 to January 12, 2009, he could be found near the cantinas of Dearic, Wayfar, and Doaba Guerfel. He returned for the Life Day events of 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nFor decorating trees throughout the cities, Rebel-aligned players were rewarded special Rebel Alliance Propaganda Tokens that could be redeemed for decorative items by talking to Oolovv.
