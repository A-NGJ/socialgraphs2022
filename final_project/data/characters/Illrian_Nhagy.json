 "content": "Illrian Nhagy was male Sullustan who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Illrian Nhagy spent some time near an Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the remote planet Dathomir. There, the Empire was conducting secret and dangerous scientific research, intending to engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus in order to create super soldiers. In 1 ABY, an accident happened at the Imperial Research Facility and resulted in the virus outbreak. Most of the Imperial staff was killed and became flesh-craving undead creatures. Luckily, Nhagy survived the attack of the creatures and finally managed to escape the area, avoiding containment into the promptly-established Quarantine Zone. Illrian Nhagy and other people, such as Tk-216 and Tyla Gallamby, were still present near the Quarantine Zone, awaiting evaluation out of the planet, when independent spacers started to arrive on Dathomir to investigate the outbreak.\nIllrian Nhagy appeared as a non-player character  in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Illrian Nhagy was added to the game with the \"Game Update 13\", released on September 30, 2009. This NPC was part of the questline \"Something is Obviously Wrong\", an introduction to the \"Death Troopers\" update.",
