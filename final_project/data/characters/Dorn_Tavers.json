 "content": "Dorn Tavers was a male Human and a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Tavers had once been Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the waning years of the Republic Classic era. A survivor of the rise of the Galactic Empire unlike much of the Order, Tavers went on to aid the Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in their mission to destroy the Empire.\nInducted into the Jedi Temple academy on Coruscant after being discovered to be Force-sensitive, Dorn Tavers would eventually pass his Trials of Knightood and ascend to the rank of Jedi Knight. Pursuing the path of the Jedi Guardian through independent studies, Tavers achieved his goals and served the Order as such. While his role in the Clone Wars is lost to history, Tavers survived the fall of the Order and the Republic, when the latter's Supreme Chancellor revealed himself to be the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious.\nFleeing Sidious' Jedi hunters, Tavers discarded his traditional robes for stylized outfits, playing on his love for fashion during his time of hiding. When the Alliance to Restore the Republic began to gain momentum following the destruction of Alderaan, Tavers' likeness was used in a propaganda piece, along with that of the deceased Jedi Sia-Lan Wezz. The banner, titled \"Remember Alderaan,\" depicted Tavers and Wezz side by side supporting the Alliance's mission.",
