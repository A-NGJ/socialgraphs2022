 "content": "Derrida was a female Ketton bounty hunter. In 0 BBY, the day Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi left Tatooine, she was in need of a partner for an assassination job against the Rebel Alliance. The Kubaz spy and small-time bounty hunter Garindan ezz Zavor, who was in desperate need of currency, decided to take the job after the Devaronian Labria tipped him off. Labria forwarded the message to Derrida, who accepted the offer and sent Garindan the coordinates.\nDerrida was originally created for the Star Wars Legends roleplaying supplement Alliance Intelligence Reports, published by West End Games in 1995. She became canon when she was referred to in the short story \"The Secrets of Long Snoot\", published in the 2017 anthology From a Certain Point of View.",
