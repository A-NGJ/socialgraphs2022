 "content": "Darth VaGhal was a Human female Sith Lord who was active during the reign of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, between 130 ABY and 138 ABY. VaGhal had yellow eyes; black, braided hair; light skin; and black markings on her face and forehead.\nVaGhal wore a black outfit that was comprised of both cloth and armor. Portions of VaGhal's torso and arms were exposed while the armor primarily covered her neck. Thin tendrils extended out of the outfit near VaGhal's elbows. In addition to the upper body armor, VaGhal wore a long black skirt made up of the same material as the tendrils extending from her forearms. VaGhal also wielded a purple-bladed lightsaber with a black hilt.\nDarth VaGhal is a character created for Red Fly Studio's canceled video game Battle of the Sith Lords. VaGhal's design was created by concept artist Thomas A. Szakolczay at some point prior to the game's cancellation in 2011.",
