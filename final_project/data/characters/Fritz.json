 "content": "Fritz was a male Sullustan who worked as a pilot in and around the Cularin system. He frequently stole items from his clients' cargoes, and he also looked down on most of them. In 31 BBY, he visited Depatar and, as was customary in the city, wore an ornate mask while there. He frequented the Grande Game casino and, while wearing his mask, he mocked many of the clients he had worked for; for this, he was unpopular among the locals.\nFritz had a thick accent when speaking Basic.",
