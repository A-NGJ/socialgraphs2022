 "content": "Machook was a dark-furred Ewok present on Endor around 4 ABY.\nMachook shared a name with a figure of Ewok legend, one said to have been a hero who built the first tree village on Endor.\nMachook first received a Hasbro action figure in 2008, as part of an Ewok three-pack including Kettch and Keoulkeech, the packaging of which appears to indicate that an Ewok named Machook participated in a conflict with the Lahsbees after the Battle of Endor. The San Diego Comic Con  2008: Hasbro Star Wars presentation announcing future figures to be released initially identified Machook as the tan-colored Ewok wearing a purple hood; however, Machook was later released as the dark-furred Ewok wearing a red hood, initially identified as Keoulkeech.",
