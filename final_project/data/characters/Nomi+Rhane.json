 "content": "Doctor Nomi Rhane was a female Twi'lek biologist who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Dr. Nomi Rhane was part of the Galactic Empire's science staff in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility on the planet Dathomir. There, scientists were secretly conducting dangerous scientific research for the Empire, intending to re-engineer the dreadful Blackwing virus into a bioweapon. Dr. Rhane was a microbiologist who operated on level 2 of the research laboratory. In 1 ABY, Nomi Rhane was present when an accident took place in the Imperial Research and Prison Facility and the virus escaped containment. The virus killed most of the people in the area, turning them into undead creatures. However, Dr. Rhane survived the outbreak and joined a small group of survivors including Dr. Stane Tritan, Dr. Pram Dramango, Marpo Glenfik and TK-217. The survivors barricaded themselves in a maintenance room with an access to an emergency escape ladder. They resisted the attacks of the undeads but they did not manage to open the magnetic hatch and were stuck in that room. A group of spacers finally entered the research facility. Following the indications communicated by Nomi Rhane, they successfully unlocked the hatch blocking the emergency exit. Furthermore, Dr. Rhane tasked the spacers with shutting down the facility ventilation to stop the spread of the virus outside the research center. The survivors and the spacer then used the escape ladder to leave the facility. Once arriving at the surface, in the courtyard of the Imperial Research and Prison Facility, they were indeed attacked by the undeads. The spacers escorted the survivors to Camp Epsilon located nearby, where a group of refugees and a functional Lambda-class shuttle were awaiting them. The survivors, including Nomi Rhane, the spacers and the refugees of Camp Epsilon eventually escaped the Quarantine Zone together in the shuttle.\nNomi Rhane appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Nomi Rhane was added to the game with the \"Game Update 14\", released on October 12, 2009.",
