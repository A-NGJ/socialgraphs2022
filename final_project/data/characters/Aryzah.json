 "content": "Aryzah was a female Human Jedi Master.\nAryzah was caught in the gravity well of the Tyus Cluster black holes. Although she was killed, her spirit remained distinct, and later rescued the gambler Kinnin Vo-Shay from the Cluster. Vo-Shay had no interest in becoming a Jedi, but Aryzah continued counseling him. Eventually, the two traveled to Morado, where Vo-Shay met Nyo, a young man who wanted to buy a lightsaber despite the fact that they were illegal under Imperial law. After a series of events, Vo-Shay was able to help Nyo acquire the lightsaber. He then introduced Nyo to Aryzah, who agreed to train him as a Jedi.",
