 "content": "Jonas Fel'Kona was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order as a recruiter for the Acquisition Division during the Galactic Republic's last decades of peace known as the Republic Classic era.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Jonas Fel'Kona was trained in the ways of the Force, training as a recruiter after achieving Jedi Knighthood. A respected member of the Acquisition Division, Fel'kona was attuned to the Force in such a way that he was able to locate potential Jedi Initiates from afar. Indeed, one of his most prominent finds, Lanius Qel-Bertuk, would go on to be headmaster of the experimental Almas Academy during the Clone Wars.\nAt some point during his service to the Order, Fel'Kona fathered a son with an unidentified woman. The child, Minos Fel'Kona, was turned over to the Order at his birth and received his training at the academy on Almas, eventually ascending to the rank of Master himself.",
