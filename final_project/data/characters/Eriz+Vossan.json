 "content": "Eriz Vossan was a male Human Jedi Master who was one of the best cultural explorers that served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. He fell into the sickness of Lord Vivicar until he was later cured by a Jedi Consular on Tatooine.\nDuring the Great Galactic War, Master Vossan went on a mission to Malachor III along with Sidonie Garen, Yuon Par, Cin Tykan, Duras Fain, and Parkanas Tark. However, during their mission on the planet, Vossan and the Jedi Masters uncovered some terrible evil and were nearly affected by it. As they tried to escape, Vossan fell behind until Parkanas Tark saved him, but became trapped in the process and was left behind by the other Jedi. Eriz believed that it was his fault for leaving his friend behind.\nYears later during the Cold War, Master Eriz went to the desert planet of Tatooine. While he was exploring and tried to learn more about the Sand People, he fell to the plague of Lord Vivicar, who was in fact his friend Parkanas. Upon discovering a carving depicting Tatooine's early history, he concluded that the Sand People were the ultimate warriors, the plague influencing him to take on a survival of the fittest philosophy to build an army for the \"coming darkness\". Fortunately, he was healed by an aspiring Jedi Consular, being spared from the plague.",
