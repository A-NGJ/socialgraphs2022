 "content": "Red Adder was a human male member of the Nexu Claws criminal gang on the planet Burnin Konn. At one time the gang encountered the smuggler Riley and her sibling, placing a bounty on the pair's head after an incident involving speeders. During the Iron Blockade, Riley's sibling hunted down the gang with the aid of the Ivax Syndicate, killing many of the Nexu Claws. Once the slaughter was over, the sibling approached Red Adder, who initially wanted to kill both Riley and her sibling, but agreed to remove the bounty and leave them alone after Riley's sibiling threatened him with the backing of the Syndicate.\nRed Adder first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Uprising, which was released to mobile platforms in 2015.",
