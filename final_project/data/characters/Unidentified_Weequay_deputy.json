 "content": "A Weequay deputy was a member of the Ohnaka Gang during the Clone Wars.\nAround 20 BBY, this Weequay pirate was present on Florrum shortly after their base was destroyed by Confederate general Grievous. He received a transmission from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who wanted to speak with the gang leader Hondo Ohnaka urgently. This Weequay then relayed the message to Hondo who then spoke with Kenobi.\nDuring a skirmish that ensued soon after between traitorous men of Ohnaka and the other pirates, this deputy remained loyal to Ohnaka. After being one of the few members of the Ohnaka Gang to survive the onslaught, this pirate ended up with much wealth and weaponry.",
