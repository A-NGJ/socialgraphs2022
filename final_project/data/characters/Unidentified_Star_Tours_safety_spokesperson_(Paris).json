 "content": "An unidentified safety spokesperson worked for the Star Tours spaceline around 4 ABY. She reminded travelers of the regulations when flying Star Tours, in a particular language. In performing that duty, she was successor of the WA-7 service unit nicknamed Aly San San, who had filled the role for some time, starting around 1 BBY. Other spokespeople also reminded passengers of regulations in other languages than she used.\nThough the safety spokesperson for the original California and Florida joint Lucasfilm Ltd.â€“Walt Disney Company attraction Star Tours was portrayed by Stephanie Taylor, three other actors were featured in the safety videos seen at Tokyo Disneyland speaking in Japanese. This spokesperson here was featured at Disneyland Paris speaking in French. Droid Aly San San was later shown using all language variations in the safety video for Star Tours: The Adventures Continue starting in 2011.",
