 "content": "Jyala Haydenn was a human female Imperial officer who served as a lieutenant in the Galactic Empire aboard the Executor, the flagship of Darth Vader, during the Galactic Civil War. Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, Haydenn and the Executor was present above the planet Jekara shortly after the Auction for Han Solo hosted by Crimson Dawn. After the bounty hunters Boba Fett and Beilert Valance infilitrated the Executor in order to recover the carbonite encased body of Han Solo, Valance was betrayed by Fett and left for dead, though he eventually made his way to the ships seventeenth level where he encountered a cadet named Venn. Haydenn was present on the bridge of the Executor when they were informed of Valance's presence by a midshipman. Haydenn ordered the midshipman to vac the compartment that contained the hostile, though the midshipman was hesistant to due to the cadet's presence. Haydenn responded that the cadet would be remembered for his sacrifice to the Empire, before adding that if the midshipman questioned their orders again, they would join the cadet through an air lock.\nAfter the midshipman carried out Haydenn's order, they informed the lieutenant that the camera feed of the level had been lost. The midshipman then told Haydenn that databanks had identified the intruder as a former Imperial soldier, and that his file contained a note that was above the midshipman's rank. Haydenn was interested by the information, and stated that Vader would want to know of the development.",
