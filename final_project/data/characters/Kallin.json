 "content": "Kallin was a male Human Commander of the Coruscant Security Force during the war against Zakuul. Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3629 BBY, Kallin, connected to the former Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh, became an outspoken critic of the Alliance. Eventually Kallin and his group of supporters enacted a plan for a false-flag operation, planning to bomb the Senate Tower and make it look like the Alliance was responsible. Basing their operation in the Works, they sliced multiple combat droids to use them for their cause, obtained necessary explosives from evidence lockups and purchased the rest from local criminal groups.\nHowever, the Eternal Alliance learned of Kallin's plan and moved to intercept him and his followers. The Alliance operatives tracked him to his base in the Works, where Kallin eventually dismissed the threat, believing the local cthons to be a sufficient defense. However, the Alliance fought through and defeated Kallin's Lieutenant Raena before engaging Kallin himself. Kallin put up a fight, but was eventually overwhelmed and killed.\nCommander Kallin appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as the final boss of the \"Divided We Fall\" Uprising, which was released in Game Update 5.1: Defend the Throne.",
