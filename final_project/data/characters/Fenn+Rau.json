 "content": "Fenn Rau was a male Mandalorian who served as Skull Leader during the Clone Wars and, after the rise of the Galactic Empire, as the leader of the Protectors of Concord Dawn approximately three years before the Battle of Yavin. During the Clone Wars, he and his fellow Protectors fought alongside the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. Rau supported the Republic's successor government, the Empire, who tasked him with keeping a watch over the Concord Dawn system for rebel activities. This brought him into conflict with the Phoenix Cell, when they attempted to seek safe passage through the system in order to travel to the Lothal sector. After Rau attacked Hera Syndulla's diplomatic mission, her rebel comrades Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus launched a retaliatory attack which ended with his capture by the rebels.\nIn captivity, Rau ordered his Protectors not to rescue him and to give the rebellion free passage through the Concord Dawn system. For the next year, Fenn Rau remained a captive of the rebellion. After the rebellion lost contact with the Protectors, Rau was sent on a recon mission to Concord Dawn to investigate the Protectors. There, he along with the rebels Wren, Ezra Bridger, and C1-10P \"Chopper\" discovered that his nemesis Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon had killed the Protectors. Rau was forced to work with his nominal enemies to escape Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos. Due to his respect for Wren's devotion to her rebel comrades, Rau decided to join the rebellion. He later aided Sabine and her family's struggle against the Imperial-backed Clan Saxon. Fenn later took part in the Battle of Atollon.\nFenn Rau was a human male Mandalorian who, after coming of age, served as the Protector of the Mandalorian colony, Concord Dawn. Thereafter, he led the Mandalorian Protectors, a group of armored warriors who protected the reigning ruler of the Mandalorians: the Mand'alor, for millennia.\nDuring the Clone Wars Rau served as a fighter pilot instructor of clone pilots of the Galactic Republic. Rau eventually came to lead Skull Squadron, a squadron of Mandalorian fighter pilots, as Skull Leader in numerous battles and skirmishes against the Separatist battle droids, often fighting alongside clone soldiers he had trained.\nIn the third year of the Clone Wars, Rau led Skull Squadron during the Third Battle of Mygeeto, on the Outer Rim planet Mygeeto. Rau's actions during the battle helped saved the lives of the Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume and many Republic clone troopers.\nFollowing the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, Fenn Rau and his Protectors sided with the new regime. About three years before the Battle of Yavin, Rau became the Empire's main ally on Concord Dawn. As Protector of Concord Dawn, he was tasked with fighting rebels forces and reporting on their activities to the Empire. When the rebel pilot Hera Syndulla and Phoenix Cell's Phoenix Squadron traveled to the Concord Dawn system to negotiate for safe passage, they were intercepted by Rau and his Fang fighters, who demanded to know why they were visiting his system. Syndulla replied that the rebels were seeking safe passage and that they would stand with Concord Dawn against the Empire. Rau responded by ordering an attack on the rebels' A-wing starfighters. During the ensuing dogfight, Rau and his Fang fighters shot down two A-wing fighters, Phoenix Three and Phoenix Four, and badly damaged Syndulla's fighter. Syndulla managed to escape back to Phoenix Cell but sustained serious injuries. In response, the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren, who had accompanied Syndulla on the mission, advocated destroying Rau's starfighters.\nWren had tracked Rau's starfighters to a camp on the Third moon of Concord Dawn. The Phoenix rebel commander Jun Sato authorized a retaliatory strike against the Protectors and sent the Jedi Kanan Jarrus—formerly the Padawan Caleb Dume, one of the Jedi Rau saved at Mygeeto—and the astromech droid Chopper to the Concord Dawn system. Despite Jarrus's objections, Wren came along intent on seeking retribution against Rau. Upon reaching the camp, Jarrus told Wren that he still planned to negotiate with Rau, however Wren was intent on destroying his Fang fighters. Splitting up, Jarrus followed Rau into a building, while Wren proceeded to plant charges on the fighters.\nWhile Rau was fetching a drink, he spotted Jarrus and allowed the intruder to reveal his identity. Jarrus identified himself as a Jedi veteran of the Clone Wars who had taken part in the Third Battle of Mygeeto. Jarrus thanked Rau for saving him and his master's lives during that battle. Rau recalled being a young and reckless fighter during that battle but failed to see what it had to do with Jarrus infiltrating his base. Jarrus then appealed to Rau to join the rebellion but the Protector was unwilling to side against the Empire. In his mind, the rebellion had little chance of victory and he thought that it was foolish to commit to a losing side. Despite Jarrus's arguments, Rau remained uninterested in fighting another losing war alongside the Jedi.\nRau's conversation with Jarrus was interrupted by the arrival of one his subordinates, who reported that a group of Protectors had encountered an intruder who had invoked the Mandalorian code to seek justice through single combat. This intruder turned out to be Sabine Wren, a member of Clan Wren, a part of House Vizsla which had sided with the Death Watch, the sworn enemies of the Protectors during the Clone Wars. While Jarrus offered to reason with Wren, Rau decided to accept Wren's challenge and so confronted Wren in the square near the parked Fang fighters.\nAs Rau drew his blaster pistol, Wren shot it out of his hand, and then triggered several explosives, which destroyed seven of the Fang fighters. Rau's fighter survived the bombing, and the enraged Protector decided to confront the rebel fleet. However, Jarrus managed to grab the starfighter and hold on to it as it ascended into the sky. Despite Rau's attempts to shake off Jarrus, the Jedi managed to breach the cockpit with his lightsaber and damage the starfighter's controls. After knocking out Rau, Jarrus carried him while jumping aboard the waiting rebel ship, the Phantom, before traveling back into space to rejoin the rebel fleet.\nAs the Phantom traveled back to the rebel fleet, Rau stirred and his transmitter began buzzing. Jarrus ordered the captive Rau to answer the device. Upon activating it, Rau was informed by his subordinates that the Protectors had prepared starfighters for a counterattack. However, Rau ordered them to call off the attack. He agreed to give the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system in exchange for them keeping his capture a secret. Rau was taken back to the Phoenix fleet, where he was taken into custody by rebel forces as a \"reluctant recruit.\"\nFor the next year, Fenn Rau remained a captive of the rebellion. He was detained in a cell while the Protectors allowed the rebels to use the Concord Dawn system as a thoroughfare for evading Imperial sector patrols. Fenn bid his time in rebel custody by playing a game of Cubikahd with Sabine Wren, a fellow Mandalorian. Despite her family's traitorous past, Rau got on well with Wren. However, he rebuffed her attempts to recruit him into the rebellion, believing that the Protectors were already doing enough without drawing the Empire's attention.\nShortly, Rau and Wren were summoned by the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios for a briefing at the war room with the rebel commander Jun Sato and Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla. During the briefing, Sato revealed that the rebels had lost contact with the Protectors and voiced his suspicion that they were luring them into a trap. Rau spoke up for his men and explained that something bad must have happened to the Protectors. He agreed to go and investigate. Hera reluctantly allowed Rau to leave for the Concord Dawn system on a recon probe but sent Wren along with the rebels Ezra Bridger and Chopper to keep an eye on him.\nDuring the journey aboard the rebel shuttle Phantom II, Rau managed to befriend Bridger. However, this was a ruse to free himself from his magnetic binders. While Bridger was distracted by the sight of Concord Dawn's shattered southern hemisphere, Rau broke free and stunned Bridger and Wren. Rau then landed the Phantom II near the Protectors Camp. He walked up a hill and discovered that another Mandalorian faction had slaughtered the Protectors. Shortly, he was joined by Bridger and Wren, who had been freed by Chopper. The Jedi apprentice Bridger used the Force to snatch Rau's blaster out of his hand.\nTogether with the rebels, Rau explored the camp and discovered evidence that another Mandalorian clan had attacked. Rau then chastised Wren and the rebellion for keeping him prisoner and preventing him from aiding his men. Wren replied that she was not the enemy and remarked that this did not make sense. At that point, Chopper and Bridger detected movement. Rau and the rebels were then attacked by an Imperial Viper probe droid, which Wren managed to destroy. Rau wanted to bargain with the Empire but Wren refused to let that happen and ordered Chopper to secure the Phantom II.\nBefore they could argue any further, Rau and the rebels were forced to flee into hiding when his nemesis Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon turned up with several Imperial Super Commandos. Rau and Wren managed to escape by hiding behind a building, but Bridger and Chopper along with the Phantom II were captured. When Wren expressed her desire to rescue Bridger, Rau responded that the boy provided a diversion for the Mandalorians, who were looking for him. He also opined that Bridger would be safer without his lightsaber since the Empire was hunting for Jedi. The two then moved to a safe vantage point on a hill where they could observe the Super Commandos.\nAfter some discussion, Rau agreed to help Wren keep the Super Commandos from taking the Phantom II, which contained the coordinates for Chopper Base. While Rau had little love for the rebellion, he was willing to help due to his hatred for Saxon, whom he regarded as a traitor who served the Empire. Wren then agreed to rescue Bridger and Chopper. Putting their plans into action, Rau sneaked aboard the Phantom II and knocked out the sentry following a fist fight. However, he then decided not to help the rebels escape and fled into space.\nWhile departing from the Concord Dawn system, Rau had a change of heart and decided to return for Wren and her friends. Rau arrived just in time to save the rebels from being executed by Saxon and one of his surviving Super Commandos. Wren and her companions had managed to lead the Super Commandos into a canyon but were unable to steal Saxon's ship. Rau told Saxon that the rebels were under his protection and proceeded to destroy Saxon's ship and to gun down the surviving Super Commando. Following a struggle with Saxon, the rebels managed to flee aboard the Phantom II with Rau.\nOnce in space, Wren confronted Rau about his change of heart. In response, he told her that her willingness to save her friends even though they were not Mandalorians showed that she still respected the \"old ways.\" In his view, that had earned his respect. When Bridger remarked about the \"craziness\" of Mandalorian culture, Rau responded that he was crazy enough to join the rebellion. Wren then welcomed her former foe into their \"family.\"\nKanan Jarrus showed the Darksaber to Fenn, which Sabine Wren had found during their battle with the former Sith Lord and ruler of Mandalore Maul on Dathomir. Rau shared with Jarrus the history of the Darksaber, including its importance in Mandalorian history and politics. He suggested that Wren use the saber to unite House Vizsla and all of Mandalore. Rau and the crew of the Ghost convinced Sabine to train with the Darksaber in an attempt to add members of House Vizsla to The rebellion. After Wren, Jarrus, and Bridger had trained for two days, Rau arrived with supplies from Chopper Base, including a pair of Mandalorian vambraces as a gift for Wren.\nFenn watched as Sabine outmaneuvered Ezra before being bested by Kanan, who took the opportunity to lecture that training and discipline, not tricks, would keep her alive in the long run. Frustrated with Kanan's teaching, Sabine went into the wilderness to clear her mind. Later that night, Fenn and Ezra sat by a campfire and waited for Sabine to return. When Ezra suggested that Sabine needed more time, Fenn pointed that time was not a luxury that the galaxy had. Shortly, Sabine returned. Kanan, who had consulted Hera, apologized for holding back her training and gave her the Darksaber. Fenn and Ezra watched as Sabine sparred with Jarrus. Following an emotional duel, Sabine managed to best her instructor, completing her trial. Fenn along with Kanan and Ezra were impressed with Wren's abilities and newfound confidence, and offered her their allegiance.\nLater, Fenn accompanied Sabine, Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper on the Phantom II during their mission to Krownest, the home of Clan Wren. During the journey, Fenn encouraged Sabine by telling her that her mother Ursa Wren was loyal to Mandalore. If she could convince her mother, Fenn reasoned that the rest of Mandalore would follow her and the Darksaber. Fenn and his companions survived an aerial attack by Sabine's brother Tristan Wren and several Clan Wren warriors.\nKnowing that he was regarded as a traitor by Clan Wren and other vassals of Viceroy Saxon, Fenn opted to stay aboard the Phantom II with Chopper while Sabine, Ezra, and Kanan accompanied Tristan and the warriors back to the Wren Stronghold. Later, Fenn ventured to the stronghold and used the scanners inside his helmet to spy on the castle's occupants. He eavesdropped on a hologram conversation between Ursa and Saxon and learned that Ursa planned to turn over Ezra and Kanan to the Viceroy in return for her daughter being spared. Fenn then infiltrated Ursa's chambers and knocked out a guard. He then retrieved Ezra and Kanan's lightsabers, which had been kept for safekeeping.\nHowever, Gar Saxon reneged on his deal and then ordered his Imperial Super Commandos to exterminate Clan Wren. At that moment, Fenn stormed the throne room with his jetpack and handed Ezra and Kanan their lightsabers. During the ensuing skirmish, Fenn helped the Wrens and the Spectres defeat Saxon's Super Commandos. Fenn and the others then watched as Sabine dueled with Saxon on the ice outside the Wren stronghold. Following a fierce duel, Sabine defeated Saxon and took back the Darksaber. Saxon attempted to kill her but was shot dead by Ursa.\nFollowing the skirmish, Fenn remarked that Saxon was guilty of treason against the throne, collusion with the enemy, and executing his fellow Protectors. Fenn and Sabine decided to remain behind with Clan Wren to help them reunify the Mandalorian people. Rau watched as Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper returned to the rebellion. Fenn complimented Sabine by telling her that she had proven herself to Clan Wren and that she would make a good leader. Sabine disagreed with the latter point but vowed to help Mandalore find its true leader.\nAfter the death of Gar Saxon, Fenn Rau aided Clan Wren in its war against the Imperial-backed Clan Saxon. Clan Wren's manpower and resources were stretched thin during the conflict. When Ezra and Chopper traveled to Krownest seeking help to break Grand Admiral Thrawn's siege of Atollon, Fenn opined that Ezra should cut his losses and he was fortunate to escape. After further discussion between Ezra, Sabine, and Ursa Wren, Fenn volunteered to accompany Sabine and several Mandalorian warriors and Fang fighters. During the battle, Fenn and his Fang fighters harried Thrawn's Star Destroyers and TIE fighters while Ezra and Sabine led a successful strike on Thrawn's second Interdictor vessel. This enabled the remaining rebels force to flee into hyperspace.\nAfter the evacuation of the rebel forces on Atollon, Fenn Rau accompanied Sabine, Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper on a mission to rescue Alrich Wren, Sabine's father and the patriarch of Clan Wren. Clan Saxon had kept Alrich as a hostage at a prison outpost on Mandalore. While watching Kanan display his Jedi powers and combat skills, Fenn muttered that the Jedi Knight was a \"showoff.\" Despite catching the Imperial garrison by surprised, they were outgunned by two AT-DP walkers. Fortunately for Rau and his allies, they were saved by the arrival of Clan Kryze forces led by Bo-Katan Kryze, a former Death Watch member and the former Regent of Mandalore.\nDespite capturing the prison, the Mandalorians and rebels were dismayed to find that the Empire had already evacuated Alrich. After learning that Alrich was being transported to the Mandalorian capital of Sundari. The joint Mandalorian-rebel forces decided to ambush the Imperial convoy as it traveled through a narrow canyon. While watching the convoy, Fenn detected a single unarmored passenger in the middle Imperial Troop Transport, whom they determined to be Alrich. Rau joined Sabine, Kanan, and Bo-Katan in attacking the convoy while Ezra rescued Alrich. Following a brief skirmish, the Mandalorians and rebels succeeded in rescuing Alrich.\nHowever, this victory was overshadowed by news that Governor Tiber Saxon had deployed an Arc Pulse Generator known as the \"Duchess\" against Ursa and Tristan's Clan Wren forces. Though Ursa and Tristan survived, the group soon found themselves ambushed by Imperial Super Commandos and TIE fighters. Fortunately for Rau and his comrades, they managed to escape aboard one of Bo-Katan's ships. While traveling to Bo-Katan's base, Rau and the others learned that Sabine had created the \"Duchess\" during her days at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore. Bo-Katan considered Sabine's actions to be sacrilegious since the weapon turned Mandalorian armor against their wearers by reacting with the beskar alloy inside the armor. Mandalorian armor were regarded as sacred family heirlooms that were passed down across the generations.\nAt Bo-Katan's camp, Sabine agreed to atone for her actions by leading an attack on Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer to destroy the \"Duchess\" and any data associated with the weapon. Sabine's plan involved one team destroying the machine while the other deleted the data in the Imperial database. During the meeting, Rau pondered whether the weapon could be used against the Empire, something Sabine rejected. When Countess Ursa offered to lead the attack, Rau advised against it since she could barely hold a blaster. While Sabine went over the details of the mission, Rau took Bo-Katan aside, and the two commented on Sabine's leadership potential.\nDuring the night raid on Saxon's Star Destroyer, Rau and Sabine's brother Tristan helped fight off Imperial forces in the hangar bay while Sabine and Bo-Katan sought out the weapon and Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper deleted it from the records. While fighting off Imperial walkers, Rau encountered Ezra, who was heading to find Sabine. Ultimately, the rebels succeeded in achieving both their objectives. Rau and his comrades managed to escape Saxon's Star Destroyer before the malfunctioning \"Duchess\" blew up with the ship. Back at Bo-Katan's camp, Rau, representing the Protectors, joined the other Mandalorian clans in pledging allegiance to Bo-Katan, the new wielder of the Darksaber and leader of the Mandalorian clans.\nFenn Rau was a fearsome warrior, skilled pilot and strong leader. As a skilled starfighter pilot, Rau was tasked by the Kaminoans with training clone troopers as starfighter pilots for the Republic Military. During the Clone Wars, Fenn Rau remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. On one occasion, he led Skull Squadron on an operation to assist the Jedi and clone troopers during the Third Battle of Mygeeto, an action he later regarded as brave and reckless. As the leader of the Protectors, he opposed the Death Watch that had seized control of Mandalore during the conflict. Due to this experience, Rau harbored a dislike for those Mandalorians who had sided with the Death Watch.\nFollowing the Clone Wars, Rau remained loyal to the Republic's successor government: the Galactic Empire. He refused to supporting the growing rebellion since he believed that it had a small chance of success against the Empire. Rau's loyalty to the Empire led him to initially deny safe passage to the Phoenix Cell and to attack a rebel delegation led by Hera Syndulla. As a hardened warrior, Rau exhibited little regret for the lives he had taken during the dogfight above Concord Dawn.\nAfter the rebels attacked his base in retaliation, Rau was so consumed by rage that he tried to destroy the rebel fleet in retaliation. Despite his hatred for the rebels, Rau was pragmatic enough to concede defeat after being captured by Jarrus and Wren. Unwilling to see the Protectors lose their freedom to the Empire, he allowed the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system in return for concealing his capture.\nDespite regarding Wren's family as traitors, Rau befriended her since they were Mandalorians. However, he refused to join the rebellion and desired the opportunity to return to his followers. Despite his ambivalence towards the rebellion, Rau hated his nemesis Gar Saxon, the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, even more. Rau regarded Saxon as a traitor and collaborator with the Empire. This hatred for Saxon, coupled with his respect for Wren's devotion to her non-Mandalorian rebel comrades, ultimately led Rau to decide to join the rebellion.\nFenn saw potential in Sabine as a leader who could unite the Mandalorian people under the banner of the rebellion. Despite Sabine's self-doubt and fears, he refused to give up on her. He was also familiar with the history of the Darksaber and its significance to Mandalorian history and politics. Rau's respect for Sabine led him to outfit her with Mandalorian vambraces. Rau later played a pivotal role during the mission to Krownest by retrieving Ezra and Kanan's lightsabers and helping the Wrens and rebels defeat Gar Saxon's forces. He complimented Sabine as a strong leader and warrior who had regain the respect of her clan. Fenn also regarded Saxon as a traitor to his kind and a dishonorable murderer.\nFenn Rau's respect for the rebels and Sabine led him to aid them during the Battle of Atollon. Rau's opposition to the Empire and Clan Saxon led him to take part in a mission to rescue Alrich Wren and to destroy an Arc Pulse Generator. He and Bo-Katan recognized Sabine's potential as a leader and military commander.\nFenn Rau was a skilled pilot and an experienced leader. These qualities earned him a place as an instructor for the Republic Military and later as the leader of the Mandalorian Protectors. He also commanded a squadron of Fang fighters and personally trained all the pilots.\nIn addition to his piloting skills and knowledge of Mandalorian vambraces, Rau was an excellent strategist and was highly skilled in unarmed combat.\nFenn Rau's armor included Mandalorian vambraces, a tactical scanner, and a jetpack. Rau wielded dual WESTAR-35 blaster pistols.\nFenn Rau first appeared in the spinoff computer game Star Wars Rebels: Strike Missions on October 14, 2015. This video game was tied to the release of the second season of the Disney XD television series Star Wars Rebels. He was later voiced by Kevin McKidd in the eleventh Rebels episode, \"The Protector of Concord Dawn,\" which was released in conjunction with the Marvel Comics story Kanan 10 on January 27, 2016.\nUnhappy with the original name chosen for Rau, Dave Filoni, during a story meeting, chose the name \"Glenn Rau\" based on Chris Glenn, a Lucasfilm concept artist, and Brad Rau, the episodic director for \"The Protector of Concord Dawn.\" The name was later changed to Fenn Rau during the script phase.",
