 "content": "Ydra Kilwallen Sibwarra was a female Human Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, survived the Great Jedi Purge, and gave birth to a son named Dev.\nA Force-sensitive Human, Ydra Kilwallen was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. As a Jedi, the Imperial Security Bureau issued a warrant for her arrest, so she left the Core Worlds. Kilwallen eventually married a man, and they had a son named Dev.\nYdra fled Chandrila after hearing that one of her fellow Force Adepts disappeared. Without contacting her husband, she took Dev and moved to the small, distant colony world G'rho. There, her brother Trig lived in Boku Settlement, with his new wife Seni. Trig was able to get her a job as a historian from the leader of the G'rho Defense Force, an Ilwizzt named Brco. Sibwarra recognized the Force potential in her son and began teaching him what rudimentary Jedi skills she knew.\nG'rho was attacked by the Ssi-ruu in 2 BBY, and Dev was enslaved. Sibwarra was enteched, and her son sensed her life diminish through the Force and knew that she would forever be lost to him.",
