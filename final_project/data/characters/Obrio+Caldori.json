 "content": "Obrio Caldori was male Bothan who became involved with the Black Sun crime syndicate, rising to a position as a mid-level administrator during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime following 0 BBY, Agent Corran Horn of the Corellian Security Force had Caldori arrested for questioning as part of an investigation. When he realized how much information CorSec already had during his interrogation, Caldori provided all the evidence he had, implicating Voydd Blancken.\nObrio Caldori was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
