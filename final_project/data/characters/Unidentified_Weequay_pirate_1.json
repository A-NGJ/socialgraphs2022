 "content": "A pirate was a male Weequay who served in the Ohnaka Gang as part of Jiro's crew during the Clone Wars. Around 20 BBY, the pirate located a starship with a disabled hyperdrive and main reactor and conveyed the information to Jiro. They then boarded and located the renegade Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress, who offered them the chance to serve them. Jiro, this pirate, and the others joined the brothers and eventually fought their leader, Hondo Ohnaka, and the other pirates who remained loyal to him. When Obi-Wan Kenobi and Adi Gallia showed up and fought the two Sith, the treasonous pirates eventually reunited with Hondo and chased the Zabraks away, looting their ship afterwards.\nThe pirate had a dark-colored hat and wore a red bandana with a white design over his nose and mouth.",
