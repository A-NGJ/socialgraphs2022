 "content": "Daruula Grah was a male Human living during the Galactic War. By 3630 BBY he became known as the gladiator in the Arena Grand of Zakuul under the title \"Nightmare Weaver\". That year, Grah was put up against a newcomer known as \"the Mysterious Stranger\". During the fight in the Arena, Grah used multiple trained Iknayids native to Zakuul, but was defeated in the second round of the Arena fights.\nDaruula Grah appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as the second boss of \"Eternal Championship\".",
