 "content": "Jokull was the proclaimed King of all Gormak on Voss during the Galactic War.\nJokull was an unusually very intelligent Gormak, which helped his advancement, as he united the tribes in their hatred against the Voss and ordered the technicians to construct more advanced technology to use against them. But the event that changed his destiny was a travel that Jokull made to the Nightmare Lands, where he met the dark entity Sel-Makor that gifted him with the power of prophecy. This power crazed Jokull enough that he came to believe that the Voss, that had similar powers, were all evil and must be destroyed at any cost.\nHowever, he was brought down by a joint assault of Voss commandos and outsider forces, capturing him.\nJokull can be brought down by both Republic and Imperial players. He can be killed or spared in the Voss quest line in the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
