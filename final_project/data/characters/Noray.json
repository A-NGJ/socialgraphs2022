 "content": "Noray, callsign Rigor, was a Human male who served as a sergeant in the Republic Army and a member of Eclipse Squad, a Republic Special Forces Division squad created during the Galactic War. The unit's medic, he was good-humored and capable under pressure, and was orphaned at birth. Prior to joining the army, Noray worked alongside Udanara in the resistance against the Sith Empire's occupation of the planet Sullust. He, like the rest of Eclipse Squad, was implanted with experimental Rakata cybernetics recovered from the planet Rakata Prime. However, the implants drove the unit insane, and Lieutenant Mak'eef—believing that the other soldiers had poisoned his food—started a fight at Fort Klemark on Altair 9 that resulted in Eclipse Squad massacring the entire Republic garrison. General Elin Garza tracked the rogue unit to Rishi, where she recruited Eclipse Squad's predecessors Havoc Squad to draw out and kill all members of Eclipse Squad.\nNoray appears as an enemy in \"Eclipse Squad,\" a class mission for the Trooper in the Shadow of Revan expansion for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
