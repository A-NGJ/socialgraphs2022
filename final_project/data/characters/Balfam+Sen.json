 "content": "Balfam Sen was a Chevin male who was a High Inquisitor of the Chevin Conglomerate of Vinsoth near the end of the Cold War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was involved with the planning of the Grand Acquisitions Race, a galaxy-wide scavenger hunt to find unique and rare items that was secretly part of a plot to appeal to the returning Gree fleet.\nIn 3639 BBY, Balfam Sen and two other Chevin High Inquisitors met in secret on Nar Shaddaa after announcing the Grand Acquisitions Race to the galaxy. Eventually, their secret meeting was discovered as part of investigations by both the SIS and the Sith Empire. Agent Reeho of the SIS appeared in a hologram to talk to Sen and the other High Inquisitors, but Sen told Reeho that he had no grounds to interfere with the Grand Acquisitions Race since it would enrich the citizens of the Republic. Reeho was not fooled by the Chevin's deception, and informed Sen that he would be seeing him later.\nBalfam Sen first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, as part of the \"The Great Acquisitions Race\" World Event.",
