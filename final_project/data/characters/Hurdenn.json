 "content": "Hurdenn was a male Human Moff who served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.\nHurdenn was an important officer in the Imperial military hierarchy during the Cold War, who is most notable for commanding the Sith Empire's operations on Taris.\nRepublic operations on Taris sought to defeat the Rakghoul plague and restore Taris to its former glory, to provide an example of the Republic's resolve to the galaxy. Hurdenn was responsible for overseeing Imperial efforts to undermine and defeat the Republic there.\nEventually, Hurdenn allied with Darth Baras' apprentice in order to see the Republic's War Trust generals killed. Once the mission was completed, Hurdenn released his subordinate Lieutenant Pierce into the Warrior's command.",
