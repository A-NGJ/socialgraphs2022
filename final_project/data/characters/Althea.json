 "content": "Althea was a female member of the royal family of Isobe. She and her brother Thelan were the children of Lord Hallux. She developed a brief relationship with Jun Sato, a human from Mykapo who had joined the renowned crystal processing school on Isobe. However, it turned out that Sato was part of a smuggling ring, which led him to be banished from Isobe for life, much to Althea's dismay.",
