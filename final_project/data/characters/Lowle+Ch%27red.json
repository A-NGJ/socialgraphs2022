 "content": "Lowle Ch'red was a Human female known to frequent the Outlander Club and Dex's Diner.\nWhen asked Obi-Wan Kenobi Dexter Jettster, Lowle Ch'red was in Dexter's Diner. Lowle wore a pretty striking headgear.\nShe was a professional kidnapper and known associate of Tas Kee the Weequay, prior to the Clone Wars.\nThe Episode II DVD-ROM Exclusive Content identifies a woman by the window in Dex's Diner as Lowle Ch'red. This character clearly differs from Lowle Ch'red's depiction by both the Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary and StarWars.com databank. Both women are wearing a similar outfit, though they have differing facial features and skin tones. The woman in the diner also wears an elaborate headdress and silver armbands. The diner patron also lacks Lowle's distinct chest tattoo.",
