 "content": "Hanthor was a male Cathar officer serving the reconstituted Sith Empire in 3638 BBY. He was recruited after the reforms enacted after Darth Malgus's coup, wishing to set an example for his people and serve them through the Empire. He was part of the support team for the Imperial strike force during the Conquest of Makeb, along with Katha Niar, Lord Cytharat, Sergeant Bedareux and Nadrin Tro. Monitoring Makeb communications and holonet channels, Hanthor also expressed interests in other Makeb operations, including a former Imperial Intelligence operative and a group of five mercenaries who might damage Imperial interests known as the Specialists.\nHanthor first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, a digital expansion released in 2012 for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.\nDespite being introduced during the main storyline, Hanthor can be seen outside of the main story phases, and players are able to accept missions about other Makeb interests.",
