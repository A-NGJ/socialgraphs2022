 "content": "\"Ace\" Lorle was the owner of Clubs, a cantina in Byrne City on the planet Demophon. He had a distinctive appearance, a small man with a fat face, hooded eyes, and a neutronium front tooth. He presented himself as an information broker, but anyone who approached him to make a deal was turned over to the Imperial Security Bureau, for which Lorle got a finder's fee. Enid Vahr went to Lorle to escape Demophon before the Demophon supernova, but discovered Lorle's Imperial connections and escaped capture.",
