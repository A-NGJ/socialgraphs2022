 "content": "Midgoss D'labaninaph was a male Devaronian merchant who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, Midgoss D'labaninaph traveled to the planet Corellia to do business. However, shortly after landing on the planet, he was swindled by the con artist Zoda Burb and abandoned in the wilderness without any money. Midgoss managed to contact Brantlee Spondoon, the assistant to the Corellian Diktat Daclif Gallamby. The merchant requested immediate assistance and a lawsuit against Burb. Spondoon was not really eager to help but she quickly changed her mind when the Devaronian proposed to offer her one of his finest wares. The greedy woman therefore dispatched a spacer to rescue D'labaninaph and his merchandise. The spacer saved the merchant from dangerous wild beasts and escorted him to Coronet. Eventually, Spondoon was very disappointed by Midgoss D'labaninaph's present: a Devaronian fur glosser. Ironically, it was Zoda Burb who would later win the favor of Brantlee Spondoon.\nMidgoss D'labaninaph was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
