 "content": "Mirt was a male Bothan from the planet of Thaere Privo. During the Clone Wars, Mirt participated in a discussion on the nature of the benefits and problems caused to Cularin by the world's platform cities. After the Tarasin Kaguya argued that the platform cities encroached on Tarasin land and were detrimental to the Cularin ecosystem, Mirt began insulting her, stating that she was a \"bark-lover\" and a \"backward reptile\". He then stated that the cities provided a place for starships to land on Cularin, allowing the Thaereian military to retain control the world.",
