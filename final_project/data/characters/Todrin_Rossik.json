 "content": "Todrin Rossik was a captain in the forces of Warlord Zsinj. Rossik was a rail-thin, blond-haired Human male from Coruscant. He was assigned to accompany Tavin Notsil when he met with Gara Petothel on Aldivy.\nDuring their meeting, Rossik discovered that Petothel's escort, Myn Donos, was lurking outside the house where the meeting took place. He was fairly certain that the New Republic had holos of him in their records, and decided to kill Donos and take Petothel back to Iron Fist. Instead, Petothel signaled her partner to indicate trouble.\nDonos took out Tavin Notsil with a sniper shot, and Petothel killed Rossik with her blaster.",
