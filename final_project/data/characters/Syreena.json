 "content": "Syreena was a female Human smuggler who worked for Viidu during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.\nIn 3643 BBY, Syreena worked as part of Viidu's crew at Fort Garnik. However, she secretly began to work for Skavak, and had an affair with him. She was helped by the smuggler after being threatened by Bracco. After killing Viidu, Syreena tried to hide this after Skavak's betrayal, but the smuggler had witnessed the entire exchange. She confessed to Ace that she briefly worked for Skavak, and apologized for what she did since she was deceived by Skavak. The smuggler let her go, and Syreena left the planet, Ord Mantell.\nThe Dark Side option is to kill Syreena, of which Corso Riggs would not approve, but no influence will be lost. He says women should be treated kindly, even if they are back stabbing murderers.",
