 "content": "Jackson Farseeker was the grandfather of Jill Farseeker, and a retired Imperial captain. During the Galactic Civil War, Farseeker and his granddaughter travelled with her father, Roark Garnet, aboard his freighter Dorion Discus.\nJackson Farseeker was a Human male who served the Galactic Empire, reaching the rank of captain before retiring. At some point, he sired a daughter, who bore him a granddaughter, Jill, after a relationship with the smuggler Roark Garnet. Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, Farseeker and Jill met Garnet, who had had little contact with his daughter, and were traveling aboard his freighter, the Dorion Discus, with him and the bounty hunter Tantos Dree. While leaving the planet Thorgeld I, the Dorion Discus was hailed by the Imperial Customs Frigate Assessor, requesting they heave to for a customs inspection. Dree made it clear that the Empire could not discover his presence aboard, forcing Garnet to first attempt to bluff the Assessor into letting them go, then initiating evasive maneuvers when they did not believe him. Farseeker spent the time plotting a jump to hyperspace to allow the Dorion Discus to escape. After the two ships traded fire, Farseeker successfully plotted the course, allowing the ship to jump to lightspeed.\nSometime later, an individual named Farsten attempted to bargain with Farseeker to acquire the mysterious alien device called ou'tranoi, offering 100 credits for it. Farseeker refused to sell it at any price, believing that the device would be instrumental in the success of their mission. Later, Farseeker met a tentacled alien in a cantina and left in their company. Seven hours later, Roark Garnet entered the cantina looking for him. Garnet paid the aliens a number of credits to jog their memory about what happened when they encountered Farseeker.\nDespite serving the Empire during his life, Jackson Farseeker was not loyal to the institution by the time of the Galactic Civil War, openly consorting with smugglers and bounty hunters, and willingly disobeying Imperial customs edicts. He came across as pompous but fatherly, and was a able to plot courses to navigate ships through hyperspace.\nJackson Farseeker appeared in several example scenarios in 1987's Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, published by West End Games.",
