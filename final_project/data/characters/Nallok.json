 "content": "Nallok was a slave dancer on a Hutt yacht after being captured on her homeworld of Ryloth. Planning her escape from servitude, Nallok learned how to pick locks, compromise security systems, and move stealthily. Before she would enact her plan, the yacht was attacked by an Alliance Special Operations team. Grateful for the rescue, Nallok joined the Alliance working as a spy, scout, and procurement specialist throughout the Outer Rim Territories. During one mission, she was captured by the Arcona, Bennbus Polag, and rescued by an Alliance team sent to find her.",
