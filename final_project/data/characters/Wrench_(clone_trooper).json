 "content": "Wrench was an Advanced Recon Commando and one of a group of clone troopers left behind on Pengalan IV after their LAAT/i was shot down during a full scale Republic retreat.\nAbandoned with his fellow troopers and a Republic accountant named Joram Kithe, they were on their own to figure out how to get off the desert planet. When Kithe awoke and revealed that he had been commissioned as a Republic Intelligence lieutenant, he was placed in charge.\nKithe was disturbed by the troopers' reliance on proper procedure, and tried to foster individuality in them. To that end, he gave the troopers nicknames. Wrench gained his nickname because he was the most mechanically skilled among the troopers.\nAfter making their way to Tur Lorkin, the nearest village, and infiltrating a starship bay, Tooth and Kithe realized that the village was in fact the site of the diamond boron missile manufacturing facility, not the factory which had been the site of the earlier trap.\nDetermined to destroy it, Tooth faced Kithe and was willing to defy the man's orders to complete his mission. Impressed, Kithe relented. The troopers sabotaged the factory with Kithe's aid while Tooth stole a Corellian ship to draw the CIS fighters away from the starship bay, allowing Joram and the remaining troopers to escape. Wrench took command of a crate of missiles in the factory assault, using them to demolish the facility.\nHe survived the mission, and would continue to serve with the other survivors.",
