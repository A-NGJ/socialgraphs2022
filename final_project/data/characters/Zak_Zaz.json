 "content": "Zak Zaz was a male Mandalorian human doctor who worked at a New Mandalorian hospital in Mandalore's capital city of Sundari during the Clone Wars. During the conflict, many school children were poisoned throughout the planet and some were taken to the Sundari Mandalorian hospital where Doctor Zaz was stationed. Eventually, Doctor Zaz was able to correctly pinpoint the cause of the illness, which was heavy concentrations of slabin added to the Ardees Beverage tea.\nZak Zaz was a Mandalorian human male who eventually became a doctor and was stationed in the Sundari Mandalorian hospital in Sundari, the capital city of the planet Mandalore during the Clone Wars. The hospital had just recently opened to the public when an illness swept through the planet.\nAs the New Mandalorians turned to the black market to acquire necessary supplies, a group of Moogan smugglers began to imported cases of the Ardees Beverage tea into Sundari. Diluting the tea to maximize profits, the smugglers used poisonous amounts of the chemical slabin. When the tea was distributed to Sundari Mandalorian school, numerous children who drank the tea began to get sick.\nAs the hospital was filled with ailing children, Duchess Satine Kryze and her friend Senator Padm√© Amidala acquired a bottle of the tea to test. Doctor Zaz conducted tests that revealed large amounts of slabin. The two women would later discover the source of the contamination and stop the scheme, later helping Doctor Zaz at the hospital administer antidotes to the affected patients.\nZak Zaz first appeared in \"Corruption,\" the fifth episode of the third season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars which was released in 2010.",
