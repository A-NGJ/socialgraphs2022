 "content": "Ungo was a Hutt active during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. Around 3643 BBY, Ungo was looking to hire security to escort a shipment of theirs through the Kellis system, which was full of smugglers.\nAn individual affiliated with one of the two sides in the Cold War then sent a companion of theirs to escort the shipment. The companion was able to fend off a pirate attack, and Ungo gratefully offered them a generous reward.\nUngo was mentioned in the Crew Skill mission \"Ungo the Hutt\" in the 2011 BioWare video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.",
