 "content": "Criakan was a Southern Mustafarian who lived on Mustafar. He led an attack on the fortress of Darth Vader, but was killed by the Sith Lord.\nCriakan first appeared in a flashback section of the 2018 canon comic Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 5, written by Cavan Scott and illustrated by Charles Paul Wilson III. According to Scott, he and Wilson had discussed what the appearance of a Southern Mustafarian without their helmet would be, and had also created a short backstory for Criakan.",
