 "content": "Rorworr's father was a male Wookiee. Sometime after his child, Rorworr, was born in 49 BBY, he was assigned to act as an ambassador for Kashyyyk on Naboo. His station allowed his son to attend school in Naboo's capital, Theed, at the Royal House of Learning.\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rorworr's father actively spoke out against Emperor Palpatine. He subsequently disappeared without a trace. By the time the Empire was defeated at Endor, Rorworr had still not learned of his father's ultimate fate.",
