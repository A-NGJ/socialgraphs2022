 "content": "This Dianoga was a vicious creature that lived inside Garbage Compactor 3263827 aboard the Death Star.\nLike most dianoga, it was a carnivorous non-sentient creature that would eat anything it could find, but it would be quick to flee when presented with danger.\nAt unknown point prior to 1 BBY, this dianoga was known to have boarded the first Death Star, and made its home in one of the space station's many garbage compactors where it would spend the rest of its days eating the refuse of the Death Star's occupants.\nIn 0 BBY, the creature's \"nest\" would be unintentionally infiltrated by a small party consisting of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa who were trying to escape from the Death Star. Upon seeing them, the dianoga was quick to attack Skywalker and pulled the young farmboy under the murky, polluted water in hopes of a quick meal, but the group proved persistent and were quick to fight the dianoga to stay alive, but luckily for them, the creature was scared away when the compactor walls activated. The dianoga itself had managed to burrow itself into the wall, and so was relatively safe inside the compactor.\nHowever the creature's survival against the invaders would be short-lived, as soon after the incident, the dianoga was destroyed along with the rest of the Death Star by the very same young farmboy it had tried to drown.\nThis creature, first appeared in the original 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.\nIn George Lucas' revised fourth draft of A New Hope, the Dianoga, was referred as \"Dia Nogu\". In the finished version of film, Lucas was reportedly less than impressed with the delivered Dianoga effect, having envisioned something bigger and more ominous.\nDespite its brief appearance in the film, this Dianoga would continue to make regular appearances in future Star Wars media and merchandise in the many years that would follow. In Kenner Products' 1978 Death Star playset, the Dianoga was first identified as the \"Death Star Trash Monster\".",
