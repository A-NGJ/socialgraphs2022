 "content": "Nack Movers was a male Trandoshan assassin who worked as a hitman on Coruscant during the Clone Wars. He shared an apartment with Ione Marcy and hired Cassilyda Cryar as his bodyguard. Movers purchased Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano's stolen lightsaber from the thief Bannamu. However, he was murdered with Sennari poison by his girlfriend, Marcy, and her girlfriend, Cryar, who then took the lightsaber for themselves.\nNack Movers was a male Trandoshan assassin who lived on the planet Coruscant during the Clone Wars and worked as a hit man for the criminal underworld. Attempts by the police officers in the Coruscant Security Force to link Movers to his crimes were thwarted by bribes and intimidation, as documented by police Inspector Tanivos Exantor Divo. Divo's files noted that Movers appeared to have been trained by the Malkite poisoners, as poison was his weapon of choice.\nMovers had a skyrise apartment on the upper east side of the Jrade District, where he lived with his girlfriend, Ione Marcy. He also hired a bodyguard, Cassilyda Cryar, due to his growing paranoia. However, he failed to notice how close Cryar and Marcy grew to each other, and that they began plotting against him when Marcy unsuccessfully entreated him not to make lecherous propositions to Cryar. At some point, he purchased from the thief Bannamu the lightsaber belonging to Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and returned to his apartment. There, he was murdered by his girlfriend, Marcy, and her girlfriend, Cryar, who poisoned his drink with the same Sennari he would use to poison his victims.\nCryar and Marcy took Tano's weapon with them, but they were discovered by Padawan Tano and Jedi Master Tera Sinube. After a chase across Coruscant's cityscape, Marcy and Cryar were stopped by the Jedi and taken into custody by the Coruscant Police.\nNack Movers first appeared in the episode \"Lightsaber Lost\" of Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, although only as a corpse. Movers' design and model were based on that of the Trandoshan scavenger Gha Nachkt, a character from the first season.",
