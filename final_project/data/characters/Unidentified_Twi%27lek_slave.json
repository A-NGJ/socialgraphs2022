 "content": "The Rutian Twi'lek female was a slave to Bib Fortuna, an ex-majordomo who had assumed the throne of his late master, the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Around 9 ABY, she was present with Fortuna in his palace when it was attacked by the ex-bounty hunter Boba Fett and his accomplice, the assassin Fennec Shand. Shand shot down numerous denizens and guards of the palace, prompting the Twi'lek slave to attempt to free herself by tugging on her chain which connected her to her Fortuna's throne. Shand then shot the slave's chain with her blaster rifle and gestured the Twi'lek to flee the throne room. Shortly after, Fortuna was killed by Fett, who assumed Fortuna's throne. The Twi'lek had blue skin and black eyes, wearing black clothing and head covering. She wore several pieces of jewelry including a necklace, bracelets and anklets, and she was barefoot.\nThe Twi'lek slave appeared in \"Chapter 16: The Rescue\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Peyton Reed and released on December 18, 2020. The character was played by an uncredited Rachel McDermott.",
