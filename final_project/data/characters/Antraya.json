 "content": "Antraya was a Naboo human female artist who was a member of the Torada Collective, a Naboo artists' group which consisted of individuals who did not feel like they fit in on Naboo. She was also the sister of Jamillia, who reigned as the elected Queen of Naboo between 26 BBY and 22 BBY. In that year, Antraya was one of five members of the collective living in an artist commune on the planet Nooroyo. Upon the onset of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Nooroyo joined the Separatists, while Naboo remained part of the Republic. Concerned for her sister's safety, Jamillia asked Naboo Senator Padm√© Amidala to retrieve the Torada Collective members from behind enemy lines, with only Antraya choosing to return to Naboo.",
