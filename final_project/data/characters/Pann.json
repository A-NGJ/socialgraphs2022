 "content": "Pann was a male Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order at the close of the Republic Classic era.\nDiscovered to be Force-sensitive, Pann was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and trained at the Temple's academy in the Jedi arts. Selected as a Padawan, Pann eventually passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. During his studies, Jedi Pann became fascinated with the mysterious Codex, an ancient artifact created centuries in the past. Employing a protocol droid named Q4P3 to assist in his search, the droid wandered far and wide on its quest. Meanwhile, the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\nReporting to Coruscant, Pann served in the Grand Army of the Republic as a General fighting on many fronts until the end of the war when the Galactic Empire came to power and disbanded the Jedi Order and the Republic. Escaping the horrors of the Great Jedi Purge with his life, Pann went underground in hopes that Q4P3 would return with the Codex. Having been drawn to the volcanic world of Mustafar as of 1 ABY, the droid eventually did locate the artifact and took it back to Pann for study. After a great deal of time and effort, Pann came to understand a few of its functions before it left his possession.\nPann was created as a character example to illustrate an adventure idea in the Star Wars Gamemaster Handbook. His existence in-universe remained unclear until it was confirmed by Trials of Obi-Wan, the third expansion to Star Wars Galaxies.",
