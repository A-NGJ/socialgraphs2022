 "content": "During the Galactic Civil War, a friend of Dasha Defano's was traveling on a civilian transport when it was attacked by privateers. The band destroyed the transport to stop it sending out a distress signal. Defano, who was a member of the privateers, learned of her friends' death and was ashamed that she was part of the actions that had led to it. She left the privateers, and joined the Rebel Alliance. Defano carried a holo-image of her friend in her gear bag.",
