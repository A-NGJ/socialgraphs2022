This confrontation came down to the heroes willing to help against the many space forces of Lord Cyssc. In the end, the heroes reigned supreme, and Kachirho was free of Lord Cyssc's wrath. Each was presented with a Kaminoan great staff by Bryes.\nGursan Bryes appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.",
