 "content": "Jesi was a male Bith merchant who lived during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Yavin, he resided on board Tansarii Point Station, in the Bright Jewel system, where he worked as a resource vendor. Hence, he often provided resources for Raine Taske, an artisan and trader living on the station. In 1 ABY, a spacer who was himself an artisan arrived on Tansarii Point Station and started working with Raine Taske. Jesi sold him various resources to craft different kinds of items such as clothing, food, and survey tools.\nJesi appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Jesi was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial\", introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25\", a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements\", on November 15, 2005.",
