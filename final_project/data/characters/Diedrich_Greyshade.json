A cousin of Simon Greyshade, it was due to Diedrich's influence that Simon's culpability in the death of their cousin Jheramahd Greyshade was never discovered, allowing Simon to become Senator of the Commonality. After the Imperial Senate was disbanded, Simon Greyshade abandoned the Commonality to Diedrich.",
