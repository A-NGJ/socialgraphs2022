 "content": "Rana Kant was a Duros female Jedi Master of the Jedi Order, and the Master who trained Stellan Gios. After Gios had attained the rank of Master himself, by 232 BBY, Kant was a member of the Jedi High Council, and was present on Coruscant during a Council meeting about whether the Jedi should assist the Republic Defense Coalition in hunting down the Nihil raiders in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. During the discussion, Kant responded to a comment from Master Oppo Rancisis about the Jedi's past participation in conflicts such as the Great Sith War by noting that they were not currently at war. Ultimately, the deciding vote was cast by Master Jora Malli, who voted in favor of participating.\nKant died sometime before the Republic Fair was to be held on Valo, and Gios, who was elevated to the Council himself afterwards, carried her lightsaber around in her memory for a time.\nRana Kant was first mentioned in the 2020 reference book Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection, and first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi. In the eBook edition of the novel, Kant's first name is misspelled \"Rano\" when the character is first mentioned during a Jedi Council meeting.",
