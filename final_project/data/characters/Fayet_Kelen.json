 "content": "Fayet Kelen was the father of Nakari Kelen and founder of the Kelen Biolabs. His business was the largest industry on the planet Pasher.\nFayet was described as portly, with an abundance of jowls. He shaved his head, which was already losing most of its hair. When he addressed his employees, he would use a deep booming voice, calling them his minions, and then soften his voice and words right at the end of his sentence. After his wife was sent to the Spice Mines of Kessel for speaking out against the Galactic Empire, his daughter became the most important person in his life.",
