 "content": "The Ugnaught male Yoxgit worked selling tibanna gas to arms dealers in Cloud City on the planet Bespin. During the Galactic Civil War, he passed the Alliance to Restore the Republic heroes Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia Organa along with Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian in the city's corridors, shorlty before they were captured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The city then fell under Imperial control and Yoxgit left for the planet Tatooine.\nOn Tatooine, Yoxgit began working for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt and again encountered Solo while the Rebel was frozen in carbonite and displayed in Jabba's Palace. Solo's comrade eventually attempted to rescue him, and Yoxgit was amongst the members of Jabba's court who witnessed the Jedi Luke Skywalker kill Jabba's pet rancor. The captured Rebels were then taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon for execution, with Yoxgit joining his Hutt employer on the sail barge Khetanna to witness their deaths. At the pit, the Rebels managed to escape, kill Jabba and destroy the sail barge, which exploded above the desert.\nThe Ugnaught male Yoxgit worked in the floating Cloud City on the planet Bespin during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. While there, he made a fortune illegally selling tibanna gas that was mined from Bespin's atmosphere to arms dealers. Around three years after the Battle of Yavin, Yoxgit and two other Ugnaughts were walking through one of Cloud City's corridors while deep in discussion when the city's Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian emerged from an adjoining room with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca and the Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa in toe. Yoxgit and the other Ugnaughts then split off down a separate route to the four, who went on to meet with the Sith Lord Darth Vader who captured Solo, Chewbacca and Organa. Shortly after the trio's capture, Cloud City was overrun by the Empire under Vader's command. Organa and Chewbacca managed to escape from Imperial clutches with the aid of Calrissian and the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, but Solo was frozen in carbonite and whisked away by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.\nSometime within the next year, Yoxgit abandoned Bespin and made his way to the desert planet Tatooine, where he found work with the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. While the Ugnaught served the Hutt, Jabba was in possession of the frozen Solo, who he displayed in his Palace. In 4 ABY, Skywalker, Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 made an attempt to rescue Solo, with Calrissian taking a position undercover at the palace and the droids being gifted to Jabba by Skywalker. Following the arrival of the droids, Yoxgit sat beside the Saurin Gauron Nas Tal in one of the booths of Jabba's throne room during a performance by the Max Rebo Band.\nAfter the band finished performing the song \"Jedi Rocks\", Jabba demanded the song be repeated, but then interrupted the second performance when he dropped the enslaved dancer Oola into the pit beneath the throne room after she refused his advances. The court then rushed to watch the dancer be devored by Jabba's pet rancor, Pateesa, after which Organa arrived in disguise as the bounty hunter Boushh with Chewbacca as her prisoner. After she threatened the court with a thermal detonator, Jabba agreed to pay Organa an increased bounty for Chewbacca, but once the Wookiee was taken away, Organa snuck back into the throne room late at night and managed to succeed in thawing Solo out of his carbonite prison. She and Solo were then both captured by Jabba and his men. Yoxgit was then present in the throne room when Skywalker arrived, entering the palace at night while most of the court was asleep. As the court awoke, the Jedi attempted to negotiate with the Hutt, but when things turned sour he threatened Jabba with a DL-18 blaster pistol, prompting the Hutt to drop him through a trapdoor into the pit were his pet rancor was kept, accidentally dropping a Gamorrean guard into the pit as well.\nYoxgit and the other court members rushed forward to witness the rancor feast, but the beast only managed to devour the guard before being killed by Skywalker. Outraged, Jabba demanded that Skywalker, Solo and Chewbacca be executed. Yoxgit was then amongst the many members of Jabba's court who accompanied the Hutt on his sail barge Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where the prisoners were to be fed to a sarlacc. While on the barge, Yoxgit sat drinking with the Snivvian Geezum and the guard Fozec until R2-D2 bumped into C-3PO infront of the trio and spilled the drinks he was carrying all over them. Yoxgit wiped himself off and soon after they arrived at the pit. Once there, Skywalker and his companions managed to free themselves and after Organa killed Jabba, the Rebels managed to destroy the barge and flee.\nYoxgit was a male Ugnaught with gray hair, black eyes and fair skin. He used his two facial tusks in blood duels.\nWhile on Bespin, Yoxgit wore grey clothing with a black apron over it. In Jabba's palace he instead wore a red suit with captain's stripes on the torso and a silver belt along with a pair of flight gauntlets and expensive, black, tactical boots.\nThe character of Yoxgit first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in 1980, where he was portrayed uncredited by Hazel Allen. The mask from the character's costume was then reused in the filming of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, in which he was portrayed by a different uncredited actor.\nThe name Yoxgit was first created for a card in Jabba's Palace Limited, an expansion to the Star Wars Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game released in 1998. The name was created by pulling a handful of random titles out of a bag of Scrabble titles upon the suggestion of Decipher employee Chuck Kallenbach.\nUntil 2004 the name was only applied to the Ugnaught seen in Episode VI, and the Episode V appearance was considered a different, unnamed individual, however in 2004 the article Rogues Gallery: Pigs in Space! written by Leland Chee identified the Episode V character as also being Yoxgit. The name was confirmed to be canon for both characters in the Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded, a source book written by Simon Beecroft and Pablo Hidalgo and released in 2016.",
