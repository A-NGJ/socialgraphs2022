 "content": "Hype Fazon was a Rodian male pilot from Rodia who served with Ace Squadron, a team of highly skilled starfighter pilots tasked with the defense of the Colossus refueling station during the era of the New Republic. Operating under the callsign \"Ace One,\" Fazon piloted the starship Green Ace—an extravagant ship designed for speed and maximum maneuverability.\nIn addition, the Aces participated in the station's racing competitions, with Fazon developing his reputation as the squadron's top racer. His exceptional piloting skills attracted the attention of many high-end sponsors whose logos Fazon added to his ship's hull in return for their patronage. As his fame increased, Fazon also became known for his pomposity, bravado, and enormous ego.\nHype Fazon was born sometime during the Imperial Era. He trained to race in the Voxx Cluster, a racetrack owned by a swindling Hutt, Vranki the Blue. In the years following the Galactic Civil War, Hype left Vranki and the Voxx Cluster and resided on the ocean planet Castilon in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. During the era of the New Republic, Fazon became known as one of the most talented pilots on the Colossus, a large refueling station located on Castilon. In his early days on the Colossus, he was friends with fellow racer Tamara Ryvora. However, they fell out of contact after Fazon earned a place in Ace Squadron, a group of the best pilots on the platform. As the leader of the Aces, he had the callsign \"Ace One.\" In addition, his personal starfighter was designated Green Ace due to its appearance and affiliation. Together, the Aces flew defense for the Colossus, and therefore, protected the platform from various threats to its security.\nLike his teammates, Fazon competed in the Colossus' racing tournaments, which became the source of his fame. In time he became known as Ace Squadron's top racer, and by 34 ABY had not lost a race in two years. As his popularity increased, Fazon acquired the patronage of numerous high-end sponsors—including Aunt Z's Tavern and the Office of Acquisitions—a fact which Fazon advertised by covering his starship in their logos. As an Ace, he also participated in supply missions escorting in freighters. However, he refused to participate in any such missions involving the First Order.\nDuring an attack by Kragan Gorr and his gang, Fazon joined fellow Aces Freya Fenris, Torra Doza and Bo Keevil in fighting the pirates off. Though Ace Squadron was initially overwhelmed by the pirates, the Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono managed to jam the pirates' communications; forcing them to retreat.\nSome time afterwards, as the Colossus was experiencing a power outage due to a fuel shortage, Fenris, Keevil and Griff Halloran went on a supply mission to escort in a fuel freighter belonging to the First Order. Fazon, as he usually did during missions involving them, instead went down to Aunt Z's Tavern, where he encountered Xiono of Team Fireball, a colleague of his old friend Ryvora. Xiono, who was secretly a spy for the Resistance, had heard that Captain Imanuel Doza might be working for the First Order and was trying to figure out a way into Doza Tower, location of the Aces' Lounge. Fazon spotted Ryvora sitting at Team Fireball's booth, but didn't get a chance to approach her.\nLater, Fazon came across Ryvora and Xiono talking about him in the hallway, as Ryvora was listing off reasons she disliked Fazon. Wanting to repair their friendship, Fazon invited the two of them up to the Aces Lounge, an invitation Xiono was happy to accept. At the lounge, Fazon complimented Xiono on his performance in his solo race against Torra Doza. He shortly got into an argument with Ryvora about the Fireball, the old racing ship she was repairing, as he thought she would never become a star racer with a ship that old. This prompted Ryvora to leave alone, as Xiono had slipped off to do some spying.\nA picture of Hype Fazon appeared during the Platform Classic. Besides Fazon's fellow Ace pilots, galactic racing champion Marcus Speedstar and his estranged older brother Jarek Yeager also participated in the race. Speedstar won the race, enabling him to pay his friend Oplock's ransom.\nHype and his fellow Aces were in the Aces' Lounge when Xiono visited Doza Tower as a guest of Torra Doza during a mission to spy on a meeting between Captain Doza and the First Order Commander Pyre. During the visit, Hype recounted how he won the Sublight Star Five Million to Keevil. Hype then requested a second round of bantha milk from Jace Rucklin, a racer who had fallen on bad times. When Rucklin argued with Xiono whom he blamed for wrecking his life, Hype reminded Rucklin about his bantha milk.\nBelieving that his astromech droid R4-G77 needed a new motivator, Hype visited the spare-part merchants Flix and Orka's Office of Acquisitions. R4-G77 proved uncooperative and struggled with Flix and Orka, who managed to subdue him after some difficulty.\nLater, Torra Doza attempted to topple Hype Fazon from his position as number one-ranked Ace. Prior to the race, Torra and Hype exchanged snipes at each other. During the early part of the race, Torra took the lead in her racer Blue Ace. However, Torra used up most of her booster fuel, allowing Hype to regain the lead. Hype then thanked himself over the intercom much to Torra's chagrin.\nWhile escorting a fuel convoy, Hype reminded the Aces that they all needed to work as a team. The Aces were then contacted by a stricken freighter, who was unable to control his ship's descent to the Colossus. With the ship unable to change course, Hype ordered his fellow Aces to latch onto the freighter in order to slow its descent. The Aces managed to slow down the freighter as it landed on the Colossus, narrowly avoiding an accident.\nDuring the Bibo incident, Hype led the defense of the Colossus against Bibo's mother, a rokkna sea monster. When Kaz came to help in the racer Fireball, Hype initially told the unauthorized ship to clear but accepted Kaz's help. Though they were unable to drive away the sea monster, Kaz's friend Neeku Vozo managed to appease the creature by returning her child Bibo.\nFollowing the kidnapping of their fellow Ace Torra Doza, Hype and his fellow pilots were dispatched in pursuit of her kidnappers. Torra was rescued by Major Elrik Vonreg, who convinced Captain Doza to accept First Order protection.\nHype Fazon was boastful, vain and pompous. He relished the fame that came with his reputation as the top racer of the Aces, a status that fueled his enormous ego and bravado. Despite his extravagance and pomposity, however, he cared about the well-being of his fellow Aces. He disliked the First Order, and refused to fly any supply missions involving them, considering their slowly-growing influence on the station a problem.\nFazon was a Rodian male with blue eyes and green skin. On the front of his flight suit belt his name \"Hype\" was written in Aurebesh, while on the left shoulder of his flight suit jacket he wore a patch similar to the logo from Old Jho's Pit Stop on the planet Lothal.\nHype Fazon lived up to his reputation as the Aces' most talented racer, notwithstanding his ego, due to his exceptional piloting skills. The Green Ace was designed to be the perfect match for his pompous nature, having been plastered with the names and logos of his financial supporters. Beyond its extravagance, however, Fazon's racer boasted wings that could shift angles for maximum maneuverability while speeding through turns.\nHype Fazon is a character created for the Star Wars Resistance animated series. He is voiced by Donald Faison, whose name and personality inspired the creation of Fazon. The majority of the logos he sports were designed and introduced in the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. Faison landed on the role after a conversation he had with Resistance showrunner Dave Filoni during the premiere of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, Filoni having seen a stop-motion animated short made by Faison entitled Black Stormtrooper, though Faison at first believed that Filoni didn't have him in mind after he wasn't called for Rebels.",
