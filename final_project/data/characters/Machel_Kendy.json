 "content": "Lieutenant Machel Kendy was a security officer in the Imperial Palace during the Thrawn campaign. He was Grand Master of K'thri as was his stepfather, who taught him this art from Kendy's earliest age. Head of one of the squads investigating Delta Source, he informed Leia Organa Solo and Winter that a third party was tapping into their comlink conversation. He was seemingly disappointed that they were intentionally holding a three-way conversation.",
