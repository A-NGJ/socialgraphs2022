 "content": "Stroth was a Human male member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. He was the leader of Crimson Nova for a long time before turning it over to Mika.\nAlthough Stroth lost his right arm in a run-in with a Jedi Knight, he held no ill will against them; rather he had a great respect for the Jedi.\nIn the Clone Wars, Stroth watched as Mika accepted bounties on Jedi. Stroth cautioned against it, but Mika didn't listen. Stroth stunned Mika and turned her over to the Jedi so that she would not die battling them. Stroth became the leader of Crimson Nova once again, and agreed to terminate his contract for accepting bounties against Jedi.\nStroth appears to be identical to the character Zez-Kai Ell from the game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, down to the same earrings.",
