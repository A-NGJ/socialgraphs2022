 "content": "Ballon was a male Toydarian, who lived during the early years of the Galactic Empire.\nBallon worked as an arms dealer on the planet Byrsym, and had dealings with the resistance fighter Prince Torrin. After the Galactic Empire attacked the planet Daimar, a group of individuals left the world to try and locate Torrin. The individuals found Ballon in the bar Emthuul's with his employees Sskal and Tarula, and they asked Ballon to contact Torrin, to see if the prince would be willing to speak to them. However, Ballon was arrested by the Galactic Empire shortly afterwards, and under interrogation the Toydarian gave the Imperials information on how to find Torrin.",
