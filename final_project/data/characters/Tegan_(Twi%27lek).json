 "content": "Tegan was a blue-skinned Twi'lek who attended Jedi Academy in 196 BBY, the same time as Roan Novachez. She was also the head of The Padawan Observer, the school paper. Tegan made it to the Lightsaber Fencing Tournament, but lost to Cronah both times.\nTegan had a lot of self-control, and was an excellent leader. She was also intelligent, as she was immune to Jedi mind tricks. She also seemed to have an aptitude for talking dogs, as seen during the first known meeting for the school paper.",
