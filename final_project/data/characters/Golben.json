 "content": "Golben was a Jillsarian who worked as a technician onboard Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport during the Galactic Civil War. His history was unknown, with some speculating that he got his start working in the swoop racing pits of Caprioril and others thinking he was a chief technician for Ne'Chak's mercenary group. Golben oversaw the work done in the repair bays, but would occasionally do jobs himself if the client was important enough.",
