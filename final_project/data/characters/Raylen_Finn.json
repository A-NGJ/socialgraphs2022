 "content": "Raylen Finn was a male Human hunter who lived during the Galactic Civil War.\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Raylen Finn resided on Tansarii Point Station, a space station located above Ord Mantell, in the Bright Jewel system, and worked out of the ranged combat training room. Although he did not like space much, he visited other worlds in the galaxy such as the Forest Moon of Endor for his hunts.\nIn 1 ABY, Finn was supervising the inspection of cargo shipped onboard Tansarii Point Station when one the station's guard went missing. The hunter thus hired a spacer to investigate the situation. The spacer headed to the lower level of the station and found the missing guard who was injured after being attacked. The man explained that the cargo in fact contained dangerous and hungry creatures that escaped their cages and attacked him. The spacer therefore moved to the shipping bay, killed a couple of creatures and harvested their hide. The spacer eventually delivered the hides to Raylen Finn who determined that the bests were bocatts, veracious creatures native to Tatooine. With this information, Finn was able to develop a strategy to get rid of these dangerous bests.\nRaylen Finn appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Raylen Finn was added to the game as part of the \"New Player Tutorial,\" introduced with the release of the \"Publish 25,\" a.k.a. the \"New Game Enhancements,\" on November 15, 2005.",
