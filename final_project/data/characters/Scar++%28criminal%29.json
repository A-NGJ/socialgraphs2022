 "content": "Scar was the nickname of a bearded male Human criminal with a facial scar, who was the alleged leader of a group of mercenaries or pirates on Ord Mantell in 3653 BBY. After killing Arigo, the local contact for the Exchange, Scar's group tried to steal three cases of weapons from Zeerid Korr, agent of the Exchange and former Republic commando. Scar and his men attempted to convince Korr that they were sent there by Arigo, but Korr anticipated the ambush and attacked first. Korr managed to kill Scar by shooting him multiple times and also killed his team of criminals, which included No Scar.",
