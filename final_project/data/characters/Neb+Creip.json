 "content": "Neb Creip was a human male who served as a senator in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. He was an ally of fellow Senator Padm√© Amidala and was one of the many thousands of mourners to attend her funeral in the city of Theed on the planet Naboo shortly after the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY. Creip walked with a group of other senators behind Amidala's coffin as part of the funeral procession while wearing a set of brown, black, and bronze-colored robes and a black hat. He had dark skin, brown eyes, and black hair.\nNeb Creip appeared in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, which was released on May 19, 2005. The funeral scene was filmed at Fox Studios, Sydney on September 16, 2003. In the current Star Wars canon, the character was identified in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia. The name originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where it was used in the reference book Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars, which was written by Trisha Biggar and released on October 11, 2005.",
