 "content": "Rymar Quinn was a Human male who served as a colonel of the reconstituted Sith Empire's Imperial Military during the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Rymar came from a long line of Imperial officers, and in 3680 BBY—relatively early in Rymar's own life—he had a son he named Malavai.\nRymar's strict instruction in Malavai's childhood inspired his son's rigid bearing and unyielding loyalty to the Empire. Colonel Quinn was killed while serving in the Battle of Rhen Var at some point between 3660 BBY and 3653 BBY, though Malavai followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the Imperial Military.\nRymar Quinn was mentioned in Malavai Quinn's entry in Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia, a 2012 reference guide. The entry states that Rymar died young at the Battle of Rhen Var, but the placement of the battle in the final quarter of the Great Galactic War on the Encyclopedia's timeline contradicts this, as Malavai was already in his twenties by the time of the battle.",
