 "content": "Cabet Lom was a Twi'lek male who had a starship repair and outfitting business in Ord Mantell during the Galactic Civil War. He lived and worked in a penthouse suite in the Pink Sky Casino. Prior to 45 ABY, Lom was destroyed by the Columi brothers, Craitheus and Marvid Qreph as revenge for the death of their mother. They did not know if Lom had killed their mother, but they knew that Lom might have been angered by Mama helping Solo in his operations. Believing that it was possible that Lom had killed Mama due to her association with Han Solo, the Qreph brothers eliminated Lom's friends and family to make sure that their mother had been avenged.",
