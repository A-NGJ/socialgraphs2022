 "content": "This chief advisor served Craw, the Dictator-Forever of Targonn, for a time. He was one in a line of many. He was influenced by a drug that made him a \"Smiler\". In 5.5 BBY, the advisor was fired by Craw, who was later attacked by the droids C-3PO and R2-D2.\nThe chief advisor was first shown in the comic Droids  6, which was released in 1995.",
