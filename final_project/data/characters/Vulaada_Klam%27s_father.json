 "content": "The father of Vulaada Klam was a human male. After the Rebellion arrived on their homeworld, Klam's parents took her and their pet qaberworm, Gurtyl, to Milvayne, a planet promoted by Imperial propaganda. However, he had been in a speeder incident in his past. This, combined with a mistake on his wife's papers and the family next to them at the processing center wanting to get rid of them because of Gurtyl's smell, led to the Milvayne Authority throwing them into the city's lower levels. Both Klam's parents died from the fall, but Klam hit a net and survived.",
